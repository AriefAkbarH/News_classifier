Coronavirus: France's virus-tracing app 'off to a good start',"France's digital minister has said its coronavirus contact-tracing app has been downloaded 600,000 times since it became available on Tuesday afternoon.StopCovid France is designed to prevent a second wave of infections by using smartphone logs to warn users if they have been near someone who later tested positive for the virus.But a last-minute launch delay led some citizens to download the wrong product.England has yet to confirm when its own app will roll out nationwide.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said it would be by 1 June, and then later suggested it would be around the middle of next week. But the BBC has learned that it is now unlikely to be before 15 June and could be as late as July.That is in part because of delays in releasing a second version of the software to the Isle of Wight, where it is being trialled. The update will add symptoms including the loss of taste and smell to a self-diagnosis questionnaire next week, or soon after.It will also start giving at-risk users a code to enter into a separate website when they book a medical test. This will allow the result, saying whether they tested positive or negative, to be delivered back to them via the app.Both the UK and France have created apps of their own based on a ""centralised"" design.By contrast, Latvia, Italy and Switzerland have released apps based on a ""decentralised"" technology developed by Apple and Google.Advocates of the centralised approach says it gives epidemiologists more data to analyse, helping them better target the contagion alerts. They are also not limited by rules imposed by the two tech companies, such as a ban on being able to gather location data. Supporters of the decentralised model say it better protects users' anonymity and privacy.StopCovid France's rollout has caused controversy.Hundreds of academics signed a letter in April raising concerns that gathered data could be repurposed for mass surveillance purposes. There was then a row over the government's refusal to give MPs a vote on the matter, which was only resolved after ministers gave the Senate and National Assembly non-binding votes. They both ultimately gave the app the green light. And the country's data privacy watchdog also approved the rollout after carrying out its own review, although it did ask for some changes to the app's wording.But questions remain about how many people will voluntarily install it - the more that do so, the better it should work.Digital Minister Cedric O indicated that he was pleased with the initial uptake.""As of this morning, 600,000 people managed to download the app, so it's a very very good start,"" he told the TV channel France 2.""We are very happy with his start, but obviously several million French people need to have it.""He declined to give an exact target. But he had previously said a publicity campaign would initially focus on city-dwellers  - particularly those using public transport, restaurants and supermarkets at peak times - as they were among those most likely to spread Covid-19.The French government had said the app would be released at midday on Tuesday.But StopCovid France did not appear on Google Play until late on Tuesday afternoon, and then a few hours later on Apple's App Store.One consequence of this was that a Catalan health information app with a similar name - Stop Covid19 CAT - was mistakenly downloaded by many in the interim, causing it to briefly top France's download charts.The only explanation given for the delay was that last-minute ""technical adjustments"" had to be made.Contact tracing apps are supposed to complement work done by humans quizzing those diagnosed with the disease. It remains unclear whether the limitations of relying on Bluetooth can be overcome to avoid capturing too many false flags.More details of the UK's efforts may be given when Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the government's Test and Trace programme, and Prof Christophe Fraser, who advises the NHS on the project, give evidence to Parliament this afternoon.It is still not clear whether other parts of the UK will adopt the app or opt for an alternative approach.Earlier, Northern Ireland's chief scientific advisor told the Stormont Health Committee that he planned to focus on manual contact tracing, saying he thought the app's usefulness had been overstated.""At best, it is an adjunct,"" Prof Ian Young said.

Google takes down app that removes Chinese software,"Google has taken down an Android service that helped people delete other apps made in China.Remove China Apps had been downloaded more than a million times in the first 10 days after its launch.It had proved particularly popular in India, where tensions with China are high over a disputed border in the Himalayas.Google said it violated its app store policies but gave no further details.The software was developed by the Indian firm One Touch AppLabs. On its website it wrote: ""Dear friends, Google has removed Remove China Apps from [the] Google Play store. ""Thank you for all your support in past two weeks. ""You are awesome.""The app highlighted popular social-media site TikTok, owned by Beijing-based BytedanceBut it also flagged up video-conferencing app Zoom, based in California but founded by an entrepreneur born in China.However, it was not able to detect apps pre-installed on Chinese-made smartphones.Among the other apps it highlighted were:Fans helped it gain publicity via social media posts, in which they suggest alternative apps to the Chinese ones.But critics have said the service is stoking anti-China sentiment, which was already on the rise after the emergence of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan.Developers on Beluga Whale, an online community for China's app makers, had called on others to report the app to Google, calling it a ""form of market disruption"".One told the news site Techcrunch: ""I think what happens in India will happen in other countries in the future, so this is a long-term impact that should factor into China developers' calculation.""Tensions have risen between India and China after Chinese troops moved into what had been regarded by India as its territory in the disputed Kashmir region.Indian engineer Sonam Wangchuk posted a video on YouTube suggesting that Indians should boycott everything Chinese - which has had two million views to date.Since then hashtags #boycottChina, #boycottmadeinChina and #boycottChineseapps have trended on social media.Bollywood actor Milind Soman, who has more than 99,000 Twitter followers, took to the platform to say he had uninstalled TikTok. It marks a further setback for the video-clip app, which recently suffered a backlash in India over a spoof acid attack clip that led to users posting millions of one star reviews via Google's Play store.Neither Google nor TikTok responded to requests for comment.",3 June 2020,technology
Android: Why this photo is bricking some phones,"Dozens of Android phone owners are reporting on social media that a picture featuring a lake, a cloudy sunset and a green shoreline is crashing their handsets when used as wallpaper.Several brands seem to be affected, including Samsung and Google's Pixel.The bug makes the screen turn on and off continuously. In some cases a factory reset is required. The BBC does not recommend trying it out. Samsung is due to roll out a maintenance update on 11 June. The BBC has contacted Google for comment but not yet had a response.A tweet on the issue has had thousands of likes and re-tweets, with some reporting that their phone has also been affected.Tech journalist Bogdan Petrovan at Android Authority said the bug did not affect his Huawei 20 Pro but it did cause a Google Pixel 2 to malfunction.""After setting the image in question as a wallpaper, the phone immediately crashed. It attempted to reboot, but the screen would constantly turn on and off, making it impossible to pass the security screen,"" he noted.Restarting the device in safe mode (by holding down the volume button during boot-up) did not fix the issue.""It appears to affect some but not all devices running the latest version of the Android operating system, Android 10. The launch event for Android 11 was due to take place this week but has been postponed.There has not yet been an official reason given for the bug but developer Dylan Roussel, who writes at 9to5Google tweeted his theory.Ken Munro and Dave Lodge from security firm Pen Test partners also analysed it for the BBC.""As digital photographs have improved in quality, phones need to check what the image 'colour space' is to work out how to display it properly,"" they said. ""It's how a phone knows how to display exactly the right shade of green, for example.""There are different ways of defining the colour space. Some spaces have specialist uses in graphic design, so sometimes you'll see images that aren't in the usual 'Standard RGB' format. It's also possible to deliberately create images that have more colour information than some devices can handle. ""What's happened here is that the way some phones deal with these cases has gone wrong. ""The phone crashes because it doesn't know how to deal with it correctly, and the software developers probably hadn't considered this might happen.""",2 June 2020,technology
Facebook's Zuckerberg accused of setting dangerous precedent over Trump,"Mark Zuckerberg is setting a ""dangerous precedent"" by allowing a post by Donald Trump to remain on Facebook, a group of civil rights leaders has warned.Their statement followed a video call with the social media giant's founder.The US president's post, about the widespread protests following the death of George Floyd, was hidden by Twitter last week for ""glorifying violence"".Facebook staff also voiced their anger at their employer, with some staging a ""virtual walkout"".In the post, the president wrote he would ""send in the National Guard"", and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". Mr Trump shared the same message on Twitter, where it was hidden behind a warning label, prompting an escalating row between Twitter and the White House.Mr Zuckerberg had previously defended his decision to leave the same post up on Facebook, saying he disagreed with Mr Trump's words but that people ""should be able to see this for themselves"".After meeting Mr Zuckerberg, three civil rights leaders responded that he was wrong.""We are disappointed and stunned by Mark's incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up,"" they said in a joint statement.""He did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump's call for violence against protesters. ""Mark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.""Mr Zuckerberg defended his judgement to Facebook staff in a virtual question-and-answer session on Tuesday, according to the New York Times.It reported the chief executive had said he had made a ""tough decision"" but the social network's free speech principles meant that ""the right action"" was to leave President Trump's post up.The newspaper added, however, that some employees had claimed he was acting out of fear of what Republicans might do if Facebook acted otherwise.The joint statement, released on Monday night, was signed by Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; Sherrilyn Ifill, director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund; and Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change. It has been published online by Axios.A Facebook spokesman said: ""We're grateful that leaders in the civil rights community took the time to share candid, honest feedback with Mark and Sheryl [Sandberg, Facebook's COO].""It is an important moment to listen, and we look forward to continuing these conversations.""Online therapy firm TalkSpace has pulled out of talks about a partnership deal with the social media giant over its decision to leave the post up.We at @Talkspace discontinued our partnership discussions with @Facebook today. We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism, and lies. #BlackLivesMatterEnd of Twitter post  by @orenfrank""We will not support a platform that incites violence, racism, and lies,"" chief executive Oren Frank tweeted.The deal would have been worth ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" to TalkSpace, Mr Frank told CNBC.Former Facebook executive Barry Schnitt wrote an open letter to current staff saying he believed he had been wrong to defend the firm's approach to freedom of speech in the past.""Promoting free speech shouldn't be used as a get-out-of-tough-choices card,"" said Mr Schnitt, who was director of corporate communications and public policy for four years.In leaked audio, Mr Zuckerberg said his initial reaction to the Trump post was ""disgust"", reports The Verge.""This is not how I think we want our leaders to show up during this time,"" he is heard to say.",2 June 2020,technology

Senator tells MPs Huawei puts US troops at risk,"One of Huawei's leading critics, US Senator Tom Cotton, has told UK MPs that he fears China is trying to use the telecoms equipment-maker to ""drive a hi-tech wedge between us"".The Republican politician was giving evidence to an inquiry by the House of Commons' Defence Select Committee into the security of 5G.Mr Cotton added that the US, UK and other allies could team up to develop superior 5G technologies of their own.Huawei said the claims lacked evidence.""Today's committee concentrated on America's desire for a home-grown 5G company that can 'match' or 'beat' Huawei,"" said its UK chief Victor Zhang.""It's clear that market position, rather than security concerns, is what underpins America's attack on Huawei. ""The committee was given no evidence to substantiate security allegations.""Mr Cotton is among a group of US lawmakers pressing the UK to ban Huawei. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that the firm would be allowed to supply radio masts and other equipment for use in the periphery of the UK's 5G networks, so long as its market share did not exceed 35% by 2023.Senator Cotton has previously suggested that Britain could lose its foreign investment ""white list"" status - which exempts its companies from increased US scrutiny of their foreign investments - if Downing Street does not reverse course.The senator is also proposing legislation to delay US F-35 combat aircraft being stationed within any country that uses Huawei in its 5G networks.Speaking to the defence committee, Mr Cotton noted that he was not speaking on behalf of the US government.But he claimed that using Huawei in the UK infrastructure could ""give PLA [China's People's Liberation Army] hackers a window into our military logistics operations"", which could put US forces and American weapons systems based in England ""at dangerous risk"". He added that as the US continued to build up forces in the Pacific, the case for keeping some US Air Force assets in the UK was already contested in Washington, and if Huawei was used in the UK infrastructure there would be an operational risk that would not be faced in other places.Mr Cotton said the ""scales had fallen from a lot of eyes"" in the last six months when it came to China.And he suggested that members of the G7 could work with South Korea, India and other European nations to create new telecom equipment companies of their own.""I have no doubt that we have the talent, the productive capability, the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit to develop 5G technologies with software and hardware that will far surpass in quality, performance and price, anything that China produces,"" he said.The committee also took evidence from 5G Action Now, a lobby group that advocates for the development of American technologies, and the Washington-based Hudson Institute think tank.While Huawei said that Senator Cotton's claims were unfounded, it added that it welcomed ""open and fair competition as it fosters innovation and drives down costs"".""For 20 years, we have worked hard with our customers and partners to build Britain's robust and secure 3G and 4G networks and we are now focused on delivering the 5G network to the same high standards,"" said Mr Zhang.""This is fundamental to achieving the government's Gigabit broadband target by 2025."" The hearing coincided with a review of Huawei's role in the UK, which is being carried out by GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre. It will determine whether new US sanctions against the firm - which ban Huawei from using computer chips made or designed with US equipment - pose an unmanageable risk to British network providers' use of the firm's kit.Additional reporting by Leo Kelion",2 June 2020,technology

PlayStation 5 and Call of Duty events delayed due to US protests,"Sony has delayed hosting a showcase event for its next games console.In a statement it did not directly mention the civil unrest in the US, but alluded to it saying ""we do not feel that right now is a time for celebration"", adding it wanted ""more important voices to be heard"".The firm had been set to unveil some of the games in development for its forthcoming PlayStation 5 on Thursday.Hours later, Activision delayed the release of new Call of Duty content.The firm said ""now is not the time"" to launch new seasons for its online battle-royale first-person shooter Modern Warfare: Warzone and smartphone app Call of Duty: Mobile.It had been expected that both free-to-play products would launch this week, presenting the firm a fresh opportunity to sell character outfits and other in-game items.The announcement came shortly after President Trump threatened to deploy ""heavily armed soldiers [and] military personnel"" to end the unrest in the US.Other technology firms have also cancelled planned launch events.Games publisher Electronic Arts postponed its reveal event for its latest sports title, Madden NFL 21, issuing a statement saying ""we stand with our African American / Black community... we'll find another time to talk football with you"".Google had earlier delayed an online event for the next version of Android.The US tech giant had planned to show off new features of the mobile operating system on Wednesday, as well as release a version for testers.On the Android Developer website, it had issued a similar statement saying: ""Now is not the time to celebrate.""It avoided directly mentioning the protests that have followed the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died in police custody a week ago when a white police officer knelt on his neck.AirBnB pulled a planned video message from its chief executive about the future of travel, Bloomberg reported.And the telecoms firm Cisco cancelled a two-day virtual conference hours before it was due to begin, and urged its followers to ""make progress towards a better, more inclusive world"".Sony's move avoids the risks inherent in trying to promote games likely to involve violent combat at a time when stand-offs and clashes are occurring across the US.Many of those who would have covered the launch welcomed the decision.""Good - you'll have to excuse me for not being in the mood for next-gen hype this week,"" tweeted Samit Sarkar, front page editor of the games news website Polygon.Rachel Weber, managing director of GamesRadar added: ""Well done Sony.""While Sony only made indirect reference to the protests in its postponement notice, it had been more explicit about its views in earlier social media posts.""We denounce systemic racism and violence against the black community. We will continue to work towards a future marked by empathy and inclusion and stand with our black creators, players, employees, families and friends. #BlackLivesMatter,"" it had tweeted a few hours earlier.One of its games studios, Naughty Dog, also posted that it was donating to national and local US organisations to help tackle racism and injustice.Other games companies that are planning launches over the coming days - including at Saturday's PC Gaming Show - may now come under pressure to reconsider their plans if the civil unrest in the US continues.",2 June 2020,technology
Trading Standards squad targets anti-5G USB stick,"Trading Standards officers are seeking to halt sales of a device that has been claimed to offer protection against the supposed dangers of 5G via use of quantum technology.Cyber-security experts say the £339 5GBioShield appears to no more than a basic USB drive.""We consider it to be a scam,"" Stephen Knight, operations director for London Trading Standards told the BBC.His said his team is working with City of London Police's Action Fraud squad.They are seeking a court order to take down the company's website.""People who are vulnerable need protection from this kind of unscrupulous trading,"" he added.The intervention follows an examination of the device, which was first reported by the BBC.The vendor - BioShield Distribution - had previously said the device was backed by ""research"", but has not responded to the latest development.The rollout of the new 5G mobile networks began in the UK only last summer and has not yet reached outside urban areas. Yet across the country there is already a cottage industry offering protection against the supposed negative health effects, even though they have been dismissed by regulators and mainstream scientists.The 5GBioShield was recommended by a member of Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee, which has called for an inquiry into 5G. One of nine external members, Toby Hall, said: ""We use this device and find it helpful,"" and provided a link to its website, which describes it as a USB key that ""provides protection for  your home and family, thanks to the wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser, which can be worn or placed near to a smartphone or any other electrical, radiation or EMF [electromagnetic field] emitting device"".""Through a process of quantum oscillation, the 5GBioShield USB key balances and re-harmonises the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wi-fi, tablets, et cetera,"" it adds.Each of these USB keys costs £339.60 including VAT, though there is a special offer of three for £958.80.But, at first sight, it seems to be just that - a USB key, with just 128MB of storage.""So what's different between it and a virtually identical 'crystal' USB key available from various suppliers in Shenzhen, China, for around £5 per key?"" asks Ken Munro, whose company, Pen Test Partners, specialises in taking apart consumer electronic products to spot security vulnerabilities.And the answer appears to be a circular sticker. ""Now, we're not 5G quantum experts but said sticker looks remarkably like one available in sheets from stationery suppliers for less than a penny each,"" he says.Mr Munro and his colleague Phil Eveleigh proceeded to dismantle the USB key to find out if there were any whizz-bang electronics inside. But all they found was an LED light on the circuit board, similar to those on any other USB key.Their conclusion was that trading standards bodies should carry out their own investigations.A search in Companies House shows the two directors of BioShield Distribution are Anna Grochowalska and Valerio Laghezza. Both of them appear to have been involved previously in a business called Immortalis, which sells a dietary supplement called Klotho Formula. Its website - rather similar in design to that of the BioShield - says Klotho Formula uses a ""proprietary procedure that leads to relativistic time dilation and biological quantum entanglement at the DNA level"".Ms Grochowalska told BBC News her company was the sole global distributor of the 5GBioShield -  but it did not manufacture or own the product. ""We are in possession of a great deal of technical information, with plenty of back-up historical research,"" she said.""As you can understand, we are not authorised to fully disclose all this sensitive information to third parties, for obvious reasons.""And she rejected the suggestion selling a £5 product for more than £300 was unreasonable.""In regard to the costs analysis your research has produced, I believe that the lack of in-depth information will not drive you to the exact computation of our expenses and production costs, including the cost of IP [intellectual property rights], and so on,"" she said.""It is therefore hard to take your evaluation seriously, since you have evidently not researched the background facts in any meaningful way.""Mr Hall said his remarks in Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee report should not be seen as a recommendation to buy the product.But he had no regrets about buying it and since plugging it in had felt beneficial effects, including being able to sleep through the night and having more dreams. ""I also felt a 'calmer' feel to the home,"" he told BBC News.And he had thought the company might be able to develop a system that could offer protection to the whole town of Glastonbury against the effects of radiation from electromagnetic fields.It's worth noting though that the regulator Ofcom has published the results of EMF measurements at 16 sites, which were taken following the launch of 5G. It said that in each case, emissions were ""a small fraction"" of the levels deemed safe under international guidelines.",28 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: France's virus-tracing app 'off to a good start',"France's digital minister has said its coronavirus contact-tracing app has been downloaded 600,000 times since it became available on Tuesday afternoon.StopCovid France is designed to prevent a second wave of infections by using smartphone logs to warn users if they have been near someone who later tested positive for the virus.But a last-minute launch delay led some citizens to download the wrong product.England has yet to confirm when its own app will roll out nationwide.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said it would be by 1 June, and then later suggested it would be around the middle of next week. But the BBC has learned that it is now unlikely to be before 15 June and could be as late as July.That is in part because of delays in releasing a second version of the software to the Isle of Wight, where it is being trialled. The update will add symptoms including the loss of taste and smell to a self-diagnosis questionnaire next week, or soon after.It will also start giving at-risk users a code to enter into a separate website when they book a medical test. This will allow the result, saying whether they tested positive or negative, to be delivered back to them via the app.Both the UK and France have created apps of their own based on a ""centralised"" design.By contrast, Latvia, Italy and Switzerland have released apps based on a ""decentralised"" technology developed by Apple and Google.Advocates of the centralised approach says it gives epidemiologists more data to analyse, helping them better target the contagion alerts. They are also not limited by rules imposed by the two tech companies, such as a ban on being able to gather location data. Supporters of the decentralised model say it better protects users' anonymity and privacy.StopCovid France's rollout has caused controversy.Hundreds of academics signed a letter in April raising concerns that gathered data could be repurposed for mass surveillance purposes. There was then a row over the government's refusal to give MPs a vote on the matter, which was only resolved after ministers gave the Senate and National Assembly non-binding votes. They both ultimately gave the app the green light. And the country's data privacy watchdog also approved the rollout after carrying out its own review, although it did ask for some changes to the app's wording.But questions remain about how many people will voluntarily install it - the more that do so, the better it should work.Digital Minister Cedric O indicated that he was pleased with the initial uptake.""As of this morning, 600,000 people managed to download the app, so it's a very very good start,"" he told the TV channel France 2.""We are very happy with his start, but obviously several million French people need to have it.""He declined to give an exact target. But he had previously said a publicity campaign would initially focus on city-dwellers  - particularly those using public transport, restaurants and supermarkets at peak times - as they were among those most likely to spread Covid-19.The French government had said the app would be released at midday on Tuesday.But StopCovid France did not appear on Google Play until late on Tuesday afternoon, and then a few hours later on Apple's App Store.One consequence of this was that a Catalan health information app with a similar name - Stop Covid19 CAT - was mistakenly downloaded by many in the interim, causing it to briefly top France's download charts.The only explanation given for the delay was that last-minute ""technical adjustments"" had to be made.Contact tracing apps are supposed to complement work done by humans quizzing those diagnosed with the disease. It remains unclear whether the limitations of relying on Bluetooth can be overcome to avoid capturing too many false flags.More details of the UK's efforts may be given when Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the government's Test and Trace programme, and Prof Christophe Fraser, who advises the NHS on the project, give evidence to Parliament this afternoon.It is still not clear whether other parts of the UK will adopt the app or opt for an alternative approach.Earlier, Northern Ireland's chief scientific advisor told the Stormont Health Committee that he planned to focus on manual contact tracing, saying he thought the app's usefulness had been overstated.""At best, it is an adjunct,"" Prof Ian Young said. The Health Minister Robin Swann added that he had concerns that the app would be unattractive to users because of concerns about it draining battery life, and that people at the end of a phone were already proving effective.",3 June 2020,technology
