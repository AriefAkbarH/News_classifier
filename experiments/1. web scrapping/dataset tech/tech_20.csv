Apple tracks looters who steal iPhones," iPhones stolen in lootings of Apple stores in the US are tracked, disabled and the local authorities notified, according to messages displayed on their screens.Apple has temporarily closed some of its US stores following a series of attacks, amid protests over the death of George Floyd.Several images of the warnings have been shared on social media.Apple said that it did not comment on ""security matters"".It is not clear whether the company has passed on the location of stolen devices to any police forces.It has long been rumoured that the devices on display in Apple stores have software installed so that they can be tracked if any are stolen.Pictures on social media confirm this. One image of a device posted to Twitter showed the message: ""Please return to Apple Walnut Street. This device has been disabled and is being tracked. Local authorities will be alerted.""The store in Philadelphia was among those attacked and looted.Purchased devices do not have such software on them but they can be remotely locked by Apple if they are subsequently stolen or lost.The firm had only recently started reopening stores following the easing of lockdowns around the country but a series of raids in Washington DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Philadelphia has forced them to shut again.Chief executive Tim Cook has told employees in a memo that the killing of Mr Floyd, a black man killed by a white police officer, was ""senseless"" and has pledged to donate to human rights groups.",4 June 2020,technology
Snapchat stops promoting Donald Trump's account due to 'racial violence',"Snapchat says it has stopped promoting President Donald Trump's account.As a result, it will no longer feature in the app's Discover section. The firm said it would ""not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice"".The decision follows Mr Trump saying that ""vicious dogs"" and ""ominous weapons"" would have been used on protesters if they had breached the White House fence.It follows Twitter's decision to hide some of the president's posts.Snapchat's parent company Snap said: ""Racial violence and injustice have no place in our society and we stand together with all who seek peace, love, equality, and justice in America.""The move is likely to feed into tensions between the White House and social media, which escalated when Twitter added fact-checking tags to some of the President's tweets last week.The president subsequently signed an executive order seeking to curb legal protections offered to the industry.Twitter later hid one of the president's tweets for breaking its rules on ""glorifying violence"".Snapchat's action will also put further pressure on Facebook. Its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has resisted internal and external calls to intervene in regard to posts on its platform. Mr Zuckerberg has said the firm's free speech principles mean the president's posts should be left up unaltered.President Trump has more than one million followers on Snapchat, according to the Bloomberg news agency. It said the app is seen as being a ""key battleground"" by Mr Trump's re-election campaign because it offers a way to reach first-time voters.The president's account will not be suspended or deleted.However, the fact it will not feature in Discover means that his posts will only be seen by people who subscribe to or search for his account directly.....have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.

Coronavirus: France's virus-tracing app 'off to a good start',"France's digital minister has said its coronavirus contact-tracing app has been downloaded 600,000 times since it became available on Tuesday afternoon.StopCovid France is designed to prevent a second wave of infections by using smartphone logs to warn users if they have been near someone who later tested positive for the virus.But a last-minute launch delay led some citizens to download the wrong product.England has yet to confirm when its own app will roll out nationwide.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said it would be by 1 June, and then later suggested it would be around the middle of next week. But the BBC has learned that it is now unlikely to be before 15 June and could be as late as the start of July.That is in part because of delays in releasing a second version of the software to the Isle of Wight, where it is being trialled. The update will add symptoms including the loss of taste and smell to a self-diagnosis questionnaire next week, or soon after.It will also start giving at-risk users a code to enter into a separate website when they book a medical test. This will allow the result, saying whether they tested positive or negative, to be delivered back to them via the app.Both the UK and France have created apps of their own based on a ""centralised"" design.By contrast, Latvia, Italy and Switzerland have released apps based on a ""decentralised"" technology developed by Apple and Google.Advocates of the centralised approach says it gives epidemiologists more data to analyse, helping them better target the contagion alerts. They are also not limited by rules imposed by the two tech companies, such as a ban on being able to gather location data. Supporters of the decentralised model say it better protects users' anonymity and privacy.StopCovid France's rollout has caused controversy.Hundreds of academics signed a letter in April raising concerns that gathered data could be repurposed for mass surveillance purposes. There was then a row over the government's refusal to give MPs a vote on the matter, which was only resolved after ministers gave the Senate and National Assembly non-binding votes. They both ultimately gave the app the green light. And the country's data privacy watchdog also approved the rollout after carrying out its own review, although it did ask for some changes to the app's wording.But questions remain about how many people will voluntarily install it - the more that do so, the better it should work.Digital Minister Cedric O indicated that he was pleased with the initial uptake.""As of this morning, 600,000 people managed to download the app, so it's a very very good start,"" he told the TV channel France 2.""We are very happy with his start, but obviously several million French people need to have it.""He declined to give an exact target. But he had previously said a publicity campaign would initially focus on city-dwellers  - particularly those using public transport, restaurants and supermarkets at peak times - as they were among those most likely to spread Covid-19.The French government had said the app would be released at midday on Tuesday.But StopCovid France did not appear on Google Play until late on Tuesday afternoon, and then a few hours later on Apple's App Store.One consequence of this was that a Catalan health information app with a similar name - Stop Covid19 CAT - was mistakenly downloaded by many in the interim, causing it to briefly top France's download charts.The only explanation given for the delay was that last-minute ""technical adjustments"" had to be made.Contact tracing apps are supposed to complement work done by humans quizzing those diagnosed with the disease. It remains unclear whether the limitations of relying on Bluetooth can be overcome to avoid capturing too many false flags.Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the government's Test and Trace programme, said little new about the app when she appeared before the House of Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, beyond saying it was a ""high priority"" to link it to medical test results.But Prof Christophe Fraser, who advises the NHS on the project, told MPs there was a ""need for speed"". An app, he explained, could still be used to serve users amber warnings - perhaps advising them not to visit an elderly relative or a friend in a vulnerable group - while their contact awaited a result.""The app provides the best early warning system by enabling us to record close physical contact with people we know, but also those we don't know or can't remember,"" the Oxford Big Data Institute academic told the BBC.""Our latest analyses suggest that even at low levels of uptake, the app will have a protective effect across a localised network of contacts - if you, your friends, colleagues and family download the app, you're creating a local alert network within your community.""But it is still not clear whether other parts of the UK will adopt it.Earlier, Northern Ireland's chief scientific advisor told the Stormont Health Committee that he planned to focus on manual contact tracing, saying he thought the app's usefulness had been overstated.""At best, it is an adjunct,"" Prof Ian Young said.

George Floyd death: Anti-racism sites hit by wave of cyber-attacks,"Cyber-attacks against anti-racism organisations shot up in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a leading provider of protection services says.Cloudflare, which blocks attacks designed to knock websites offline, says advocacy groups in general saw attacks increase 1,120-fold.Mr Floyd's death, in police custody, has sparked nationwide civil unrest in the US.Government and military websites also saw a notable increase in attacks.DDoS attacks - short for Distributed Denial of Service - are a relatively simple cyber-attack tool, in which the attacker tries to flood a website or other online service with so many fake ""users"" that it cannot cope.The effect is that it gets knocked offline for people trying to access information or services.Cloudflare says that after Mr Floyd's death and the ensuing violent clashes between police and protesters, it saw a noticeable jump in the amount of requests it blocked - an extra 19 billion (17%) from the corresponding weekend the previous month.That equates to an extra 110,000 blocked requests every second, it said.The problem was particularly acute for certain types of organisations. One single website belonging to an unnamed advocacy group dealt with 20,000 requests a second.Anti-racism groups which belong to Cloudflare's free programme for at-risk organisations saw a large surge in the past week, from near-zero to more than 120 million blocked requests.Attacks on government and military websites were also up - by 1.8 and 3.8 times respectively.It follows a sudden swell of interest in the ""hacktivist"" collective Anonymous, which has said it will support the protesters, and threatened to target the police in the city of Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed. The group has often used DDoS attacks in the past.Cloudflare, meanwhile, invited at-risk groups to join its free protection programme.""As we've often seen in the past, real world protest and violence is usually accompanied by attacks on the internet,"" Cloudflare said in a blog post written by its chief executive and chief technology officer.""Unfortunately, if recent history is any guide, those who speak out against oppression will continue to face cyber-attacks that attempt to silence them.""",3 June 2020,technology
Google takes down app that removes Chinese software,"Google has taken down an Android service that helped people delete other apps made in China.Remove China Apps had been downloaded more than a million times in the first 10 days after its launch.It had proved particularly popular in India, where tensions with China are high over a disputed border in the Himalayas.Google said it violated its app store policies but gave no further details.The software was developed by the Indian firm One Touch AppLabs. On its website it wrote: ""Dear friends, Google has removed Remove China Apps from [the] Google Play store. ""Thank you for all your support in past two weeks. ""You are awesome.""The app highlighted popular social-media site TikTok, owned by Beijing-based BytedanceBut it also flagged up video-conferencing app Zoom, based in California but founded by an entrepreneur born in China.However, it was not able to detect apps pre-installed on Chinese-made smartphones.Among the other apps it highlighted were:Fans helped it gain publicity via social media posts, in which they suggest alternative apps to the Chinese ones.But critics have said the service is stoking anti-China sentiment, which was already on the rise after the emergence of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan.Developers on Beluga Whale, an online community for China's app makers, had called on others to report the app to Google, calling it a ""form of market disruption"".One told the news site Techcrunch: ""I think what happens in India will happen in other countries in the future, so this is a long-term impact that should factor into China developers' calculation.""Tensions have risen between India and China after Chinese troops moved into what had been regarded by India as its territory in the disputed Kashmir region.Indian engineer Sonam Wangchuk posted a video on YouTube suggesting that Indians should boycott everything Chinese - which has had two million views to date.Since then hashtags #boycottChina, #boycottmadeinChina and #boycottChineseapps have trended on social media.Bollywood actor Milind Soman, who has more than 99,000 Twitter followers, took to the platform to say he had uninstalled TikTok. It marks a further setback for the video-clip app, which recently suffered a backlash in India over a spoof acid attack clip that led to users posting millions of one star reviews via Google's Play store.Neither Google nor TikTok responded to requests for comment.",3 June 2020,technology

George Floyd death: Anti-racism sites hit by wave of cyber-attacks,"Cyber-attacks against anti-racism organisations shot up in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a leading provider of protection services says.Cloudflare, which blocks attacks designed to knock websites offline, says advocacy groups in general saw attacks increase 1,120-fold.Mr Floyd's death, in police custody, has sparked nationwide civil unrest in the US.Government and military websites also saw a notable increase in attacks.DDoS attacks - short for Distributed Denial of Service - are a relatively simple cyber-attack tool, in which the attacker tries to flood a website or other online service with so many fake ""users"" that it cannot cope.The effect is that it gets knocked offline for people trying to access information or services.Cloudflare says that after Mr Floyd's death and the ensuing violent clashes between police and protesters, it saw a noticeable jump in the amount of requests it blocked - an extra 19 billion (17%) from the corresponding weekend the previous month.That equates to an extra 110,000 blocked requests every second, it said.The problem was particularly acute for certain types of organisations. One single website belonging to an unnamed advocacy group dealt with 20,000 requests a second.Anti-racism groups which belong to Cloudflare's free programme for at-risk organisations saw a large surge in the past week, from near-zero to more than 120 million blocked requests.Attacks on government and military websites were also up - by 1.8 and 3.8 times respectively.It follows a sudden swell of interest in the ""hacktivist"" collective Anonymous, which has said it will support the protesters, and threatened to target the police in the city of Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed. The group has often used DDoS attacks in the past.Cloudflare, meanwhile, invited at-risk groups to join its free protection programme.""As we've often seen in the past, real world protest and violence is usually accompanied by attacks on the internet,"" Cloudflare said in a blog post written by its chief executive and chief technology officer.""Unfortunately, if recent history is any guide, those who speak out against oppression will continue to face cyber-attacks that attempt to silence them.""",3 June 2020,technology

Snapchat stops promoting Donald Trump's account due to 'racial violence',"Snapchat says it has stopped promoting President Donald Trump's account.As a result, it will no longer feature in the app's Discover section. The firm said it would ""not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice"".The decision follows Mr Trump saying that ""vicious dogs"" and ""ominous weapons"" would have been used on protesters if they had breached the White House fence.It follows Twitter's decision to hide some of the president's posts.Snapchat's parent company Snap said: ""Racial violence and injustice have no place in our society and we stand together with all who seek peace, love, equality, and justice in America.""The move is likely to feed into tensions between the White House and social media, which escalated when Twitter added fact-checking tags to some of the President's tweets last week.The president subsequently signed an executive order seeking to curb legal protections offered to the industry.Twitter later hid one of the president's tweets for breaking its rules on ""glorifying violence"".Snapchat's action will also put further pressure on Facebook. Its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has resisted internal and external calls to intervene in regard to posts on its platform. Mr Zuckerberg has said the firm's free speech principles mean the president's posts should be left up unaltered.President Trump has more than one million followers on Snapchat, according to the Bloomberg news agency. It said the app is seen as being a ""key battleground"" by Mr Trump's re-election campaign because it offers a way to reach first-time voters.The president's account will not be suspended or deleted.However, the fact it will not feature in Discover means that his posts will only be seen by people who subscribe to or search for his account directly.....have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.

Coronavirus: France's virus-tracing app 'off to a good start',"France's digital minister has said its coronavirus contact-tracing app has been downloaded 600,000 times since it became available on Tuesday afternoon.StopCovid France is designed to prevent a second wave of infections by using smartphone logs to warn users if they have been near someone who later tested positive for the virus.But a last-minute launch delay led some citizens to download the wrong product.England has yet to confirm when its own app will roll out nationwide.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said it would be by 1 June, and then later suggested it would be around the middle of next week. But the BBC has learned that it is now unlikely to be before 15 June and could be as late as the start of July.That is in part because of delays in releasing a second version of the software to the Isle of Wight, where it is being trialled. The update will add symptoms including the loss of taste and smell to a self-diagnosis questionnaire next week, or soon after.It will also start giving at-risk users a code to enter into a separate website when they book a medical test. This will allow the result, saying whether they tested positive or negative, to be delivered back to them via the app.Both the UK and France have created apps of their own based on a ""centralised"" design.By contrast, Latvia, Italy and Switzerland have released apps based on a ""decentralised"" technology developed by Apple and Google.Advocates of the centralised approach says it gives epidemiologists more data to analyse, helping them better target the contagion alerts. They are also not limited by rules imposed by the two tech companies, such as a ban on being able to gather location data. Supporters of the decentralised model say it better protects users' anonymity and privacy.StopCovid France's rollout has caused controversy.Hundreds of academics signed a letter in April raising concerns that gathered data could be repurposed for mass surveillance purposes. There was then a row over the government's refusal to give MPs a vote on the matter, which was only resolved after ministers gave the Senate and National Assembly non-binding votes. They both ultimately gave the app the green light. And the country's data privacy watchdog also approved the rollout after carrying out its own review, although it did ask for some changes to the app's wording.But questions remain about how many people will voluntarily install it - the more that do so, the better it should work.Digital Minister Cedric O indicated that he was pleased with the initial uptake.""As of this morning, 600,000 people managed to download the app, so it's a very very good start,"" he told the TV channel France 2.""We are very happy with his start, but obviously several million French people need to have it.""He declined to give an exact target. But he had previously said a publicity campaign would initially focus on city-dwellers  - particularly those using public transport, restaurants and supermarkets at peak times - as they were among those most likely to spread Covid-19.The French government had said the app would be released at midday on Tuesday.But StopCovid France did not appear on Google Play until late on Tuesday afternoon, and then a few hours later on Apple's App Store.One consequence of this was that a Catalan health information app with a similar name - Stop Covid19 CAT - was mistakenly downloaded by many in the interim, causing it to briefly top France's download charts.The only explanation given for the delay was that last-minute ""technical adjustments"" had to be made.Contact tracing apps are supposed to complement work done by humans quizzing those diagnosed with the disease. It remains unclear whether the limitations of relying on Bluetooth can be overcome to avoid capturing too many false flags.Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the government's Test and Trace programme, said little new about the app when she appeared before the House of Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, beyond saying it was a ""high priority"" to link it to medical test results.But Prof Christophe Fraser, who advises the NHS on the project, told MPs there was a ""need for speed"". An app, he explained, could still be used to serve users amber warnings - perhaps advising them not to visit an elderly relative or a friend in a vulnerable group - while their contact awaited a result.""The app provides the best early warning system by enabling us to record close physical contact with people we know, but also those we don't know or can't remember,"" the Oxford Big Data Institute academic told the BBC.""Our latest analyses suggest that even at low levels of uptake, the app will have a protective effect across a localised network of contacts - if you, your friends, colleagues and family download the app, you're creating a local alert network within your community.""But it is still not clear whether other parts of the UK will adopt it.Earlier, Northern Ireland's chief scientific advisor told the Stormont Health Committee that he planned to focus on manual contact tracing, saying he thought the app's usefulness had been overstated.""At best, it is an adjunct,"" Prof Ian Young said.

Android: Why this photo is bricking some phones,"Dozens of Android phone owners are reporting on social media that a picture featuring a lake, a cloudy sunset and a green shoreline is crashing their handsets when used as wallpaper.Several brands seem to be affected, including Samsung and Google's Pixel.The bug makes the screen turn on and off continuously. In some cases a factory reset is required. The BBC does not recommend trying it out. Samsung is due to roll out a maintenance update on 11 June. The BBC has contacted Google for comment but not yet had a response.A tweet on the issue has had thousands of likes and re-tweets, with some reporting that their phone has also been affected.Tech journalist Bogdan Petrovan at Android Authority said the bug did not affect his Huawei 20 Pro but it did cause a Google Pixel 2 to malfunction.""After setting the image in question as a wallpaper, the phone immediately crashed. It attempted to reboot, but the screen would constantly turn on and off, making it impossible to pass the security screen,"" he noted.Restarting the device in safe mode (by holding down the volume button during boot-up) did not fix the issue.""It appears to affect some but not all devices running the latest version of the Android operating system, Android 10. The launch event for Android 11 was due to take place this week but has been postponed.There has not yet been an official reason given for the bug but developer Dylan Roussel, who writes at 9to5Google tweeted his theory.Ken Munro and Dave Lodge from security firm Pen Test partners also analysed it for the BBC.""As digital photographs have improved in quality, phones need to check what the image 'colour space' is to work out how to display it properly,"" they said. ""It's how a phone knows how to display exactly the right shade of green, for example.""There are different ways of defining the colour space. Some spaces have specialist uses in graphic design, so sometimes you'll see images that aren't in the usual 'Standard RGB' format. It's also possible to deliberately create images that have more colour information than some devices can handle. ""What's happened here is that the way some phones deal with these cases has gone wrong.

Facebook's Zuckerberg accused of setting dangerous precedent over Trump,"Mark Zuckerberg is setting a ""dangerous precedent"" by allowing a post by Donald Trump to remain on Facebook, a group of civil rights leaders has warned.Their statement followed a video call with the social media giant's founder.The US president's post, about the widespread protests following the death of George Floyd, was hidden by Twitter last week for ""glorifying violence"".Facebook staff also voiced their anger at their employer, with some staging a ""virtual walkout"".In the post, the president wrote he would ""send in the National Guard"", and warned that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". Mr Trump shared the same message on Twitter, where it was hidden behind a warning label, prompting an escalating row between Twitter and the White House.Mr Zuckerberg had previously defended his decision to leave the same post up on Facebook, saying he disagreed with Mr Trump's words but that people ""should be able to see this for themselves"".After meeting Mr Zuckerberg, three civil rights leaders responded that he was wrong.""We are disappointed and stunned by Mark's incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up,"" they said in a joint statement.""He did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump's call for violence against protesters. ""Mark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.""Mr Zuckerberg defended his judgement to Facebook staff in a virtual question-and-answer session on Tuesday, according to the New York Times.It reported the chief executive had said he had made a ""tough decision"" but the social network's free speech principles meant that ""the right action"" was to leave President Trump's post up.The newspaper added, however, that some employees had claimed he was acting out of fear of what Republicans might do if Facebook acted otherwise.Woof. intense qutestion from FB employee:""“Why are the smartest people in the world focused on contorting and twisting our policies to avoid antagonizing trump?”https://t.co/ZSpKcyDOjiEnd of Twitter post  by @MikeIsaacThe joint statement, released on Monday night, was signed by Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; Sherrilyn Ifill, director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund; and Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change.

Senator tells MPs Huawei puts US troops at risk,"One of Huawei's leading critics, US Senator Tom Cotton, has told UK MPs that he fears China is trying to use the telecoms equipment-maker to ""drive a hi-tech wedge between us"".The Republican politician was giving evidence to an inquiry by the House of Commons' Defence Select Committee into the security of 5G.Mr Cotton added that the US, UK and other allies could team up to develop superior 5G technologies of their own.Huawei said the claims lacked evidence.""Today's committee concentrated on America's desire for a home-grown 5G company that can 'match' or 'beat' Huawei,"" said its UK chief Victor Zhang.""It's clear that market position, rather than security concerns, is what underpins America's attack on Huawei. ""The committee was given no evidence to substantiate security allegations.""Mr Cotton is among a group of US lawmakers pressing the UK to ban Huawei. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that the firm would be allowed to supply radio masts and other equipment for use in the periphery of the UK's 5G networks, so long as its market share did not exceed 35% by 2023.Senator Cotton has previously suggested that Britain could lose its foreign investment ""white list"" status - which exempts its companies from increased US scrutiny of their foreign investments - if Downing Street does not reverse course.The senator is also proposing legislation to delay US F-35 combat aircraft being stationed within any country that uses Huawei in its 5G networks.Speaking to the defence committee, Mr Cotton noted that he was not speaking on behalf of the US government.But he claimed that using Huawei in the UK infrastructure could ""give PLA [China's People's Liberation Army] hackers a window into our military logistics operations"", which could put US forces and American weapons systems based in England ""at dangerous risk"". He added that as the US continued to build up forces in the Pacific, the case for keeping some US Air Force assets in the UK was already contested in Washington, and if Huawei was used in the UK infrastructure there would be an operational risk that would not be faced in other places.Mr Cotton said the ""scales had fallen from a lot of eyes"" in the last six months when it came to China.And he suggested that members of the G7 could work with South Korea, India and other European nations to create new telecom equipment companies of their own.""I have no doubt that we have the talent, the productive capability, the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit to develop 5G technologies with software and hardware that will far surpass in quality, performance and price, anything that China produces,"" he said.The committee also took evidence from 5G Action Now, a lobby group that advocates for the development of American technologies, and the Washington-based Hudson Institute think tank.While Huawei said that Senator Cotton's claims were unfounded, it added that it welcomed ""open and fair competition as it fosters innovation and drives down costs"".""For 20 years, we have worked hard with our customers and partners to build Britain's robust and secure 3G and 4G networks and we are now focused on delivering the 5G network to the same high standards,"" said Mr Zhang.""This is fundamental to achieving the government's Gigabit broadband target by 2025."" The hearing coincided with a review of Huawei's role in the UK, which is being carried out by GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre. It will determine whether new US sanctions against the firm - which ban Huawei from using computer chips made or designed with US equipment - pose an unmanageable risk to British network providers' use of the firm's kit.Additional reporting by Leo Kelion",2 June 2020,technology
Trading Standards squad targets anti-5G USB stick,"Trading Standards officers are seeking to halt sales of a device that has been claimed to offer protection against the supposed dangers of 5G via use of quantum technology.Cyber-security experts say the £339 5GBioShield appears to no more than a basic USB drive.""We consider it to be a scam,"" Stephen Knight, operations director for London Trading Standards told the BBC.His said his team is working with City of London Police's Action Fraud squad.They are seeking a court order to take down the company's website.""People who are vulnerable need protection from this kind of unscrupulous trading,"" he added.The intervention follows an examination of the device, which was first reported by the BBC.The vendor - BioShield Distribution - had previously said the device was backed by ""research"", but has not responded to the latest development.The rollout of the new 5G mobile networks began in the UK only last summer and has not yet reached outside urban areas. Yet across the country there is already a cottage industry offering protection against the supposed negative health effects, even though they have been dismissed by regulators and mainstream scientists.The 5GBioShield was recommended by a member of Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee, which has called for an inquiry into 5G. One of nine external members, Toby Hall, said: ""We use this device and find it helpful,"" and provided a link to its website, which describes it as a USB key that ""provides protection for  your home and family, thanks to the wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser, which can be worn or placed near to a smartphone or any other electrical, radiation or EMF [electromagnetic field] emitting device"".""Through a process of quantum oscillation, the 5GBioShield USB key balances and re-harmonises the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wi-fi, tablets, et cetera,"" it adds.Each of these USB keys costs £339.60 including VAT, though there is a special offer of three for £958.80.But, at first sight, it seems to be just that - a USB key, with just 128MB of storage.""So what's different between it and a virtually identical 'crystal' USB key available from various suppliers in Shenzhen, China, for around £5 per key?"" asks Ken Munro, whose company, Pen Test Partners, specialises in taking apart consumer electronic products to spot security vulnerabilities.And the answer appears to be a circular sticker. ""Now, we're not 5G quantum experts but said sticker looks remarkably like one available in sheets from stationery suppliers for less than a penny each,"" he says.Mr Munro and his colleague Phil Eveleigh proceeded to dismantle the USB key to find out if there were any whizz-bang electronics inside. But all they found was an LED light on the circuit board, similar to those on any other USB key.Their conclusion was that trading standards bodies should carry out their own investigations.A search in Companies House shows the two directors of BioShield Distribution are Anna Grochowalska and Valerio Laghezza. Both of them appear to have been involved previously in a business called Immortalis, which sells a dietary supplement called Klotho Formula. Its website - rather similar in design to that of the BioShield - says Klotho Formula uses a ""proprietary procedure that leads to relativistic time dilation and biological quantum entanglement at the DNA level"".Ms Grochowalska told BBC News her company was the sole global distributor of the 5GBioShield -  but it did not manufacture or own the product. ""We are in possession of a great deal of technical information, with plenty of back-up historical research,"" she said.""As you can understand, we are not authorised to fully disclose all this sensitive information to third parties, for obvious reasons.""And she rejected the suggestion selling a £5 product for more than £300 was unreasonable.""In regard to the costs analysis your research has produced, I believe that the lack of in-depth information will not drive you to the exact computation of our expenses and production costs, including the cost of IP [intellectual property rights], and so on,"" she said.""It is therefore hard to take your evaluation seriously, since you have evidently not researched the background facts in any meaningful way.""Mr Hall said his remarks in Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee report should not be seen as a recommendation to buy the product.But he had no regrets about buying it and since plugging it in had felt beneficial effects, including being able to sleep through the night and having more dreams. ""I also felt a 'calmer' feel to the home,"" he told BBC News.And he had thought the company might be able to develop a system that could offer protection to the whole town of Glastonbury against the effects of radiation from electromagnetic fields.It's worth noting though that the regulator Ofcom has published the results of EMF measurements at 16 sites, which were taken following the launch of 5G. It said that in each case, emissions were ""a small fraction"" of the levels deemed safe under international guidelines.",28 May 2020,technology

""As we've said previously, we will not take enforcement action on every Tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about Covid-19. Since introducing these new policies on March 18 and as we've doubled down on tech, our automated systems have challenged more than 4.3 million accounts which were targeting discussions around Covid-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviours.""Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said the firms were ""shirking their responsibilities"".""Their systems for reporting misinformation and dealing with it are simply not fit for purpose.""Social media giants have claimed many times that they are taking Covid-related misinformation seriously, but this new research shows that even when they are handed the posts promoting misinformation, they fail to take action.""Rosanne Palmer-White, director of youth action group Restless Development, which also took part in the survey, said young people were ""doing their bit to stop the spread of misinformation"" but social media firms were ""letting them down"".Both Twitter and Facebook face questions from the UK's Digital Culture Media and Sport sub-committee on the way they are handling coronavirus misinformation.MPs were not happy with an earlier session. They demanded more detailed answers and said more senior executives should attend the next meeting.For the study, ten volunteers from the UK, Ireland and Romania searched social media for misinformation from the end of April to the end of May.They found posts suggesting sufferers can get rid of coronavirus by drinking aspirin dissolved in hot water or by taking zinc and vitamin C and D supplements,Twitter was deemed the least responsive, with only 3% of the 179 posts acted upon.Facebook removed 10% of the 334 posts reported and flagged another 2% as false. Instagram, which Facebook owns, acted on 10% of the 135 complaints it was sent.Both the social networks insist they have made efforts to bring fake news about the coronavirus under control.Twitter has begun labelling tweets that spread misinformation about Covid-19. Facebook has also removed some content, including from groups claiming the rollout of the 5G network was a cause of the spread of the virus.All eyes have been on how social media sites have tackled misleading information on their platforms in recent weeks - and all eyes will be on them again today, as they're grilled by MPs. Over the course of the pandemic, different social media companies have made a number of changes to their policies to try to tackle harmful and misleading information. Facebook and YouTube both say they have cracked down on conspiracies that could do damage.And in a high-profile move, Twitter decided to label a misleading tweet by US President Donald Trump - although it was one about postal voting rather than coronavirus. But these changes in policy don't seem easy to implement. In practice, misleading posts are often not reported - or when they are, they are not always removed. The question of the harm different posts pose appears to be at the root of this problem. Messages posing an immediate threat to life are removed more quickly. However, misleading messages that pose a less immediate threat can prove to be just as dangerous - including those from anti-vaccination groups. A BBC Investigation into the human cost of misinformation found that the potential for indirect harm caused by conspiracies and bad information that undermine public health messaging - or an effective vaccine - could be huge. And as misinformation about protests and other news events floods social media, it becomes apparent that the pandemic is just one of many battles against misinformation to be fought.

Snapchat stops promoting Donald Trump's account due to 'racial violence',"Snapchat says it has stopped promoting President Donald Trump's account.As a result, it will no longer feature in the app's Discover section. The firm said it would ""not amplify voices who incite racial violence and injustice"".The decision follows Mr Trump saying that ""vicious dogs"" and ""ominous weapons"" would have been used on protesters if they had breached the White House fence.It follows Twitter's decision to hide some of the president's posts.Snapchat's parent company Snap said: ""Racial violence and injustice have no place in our society and we stand together with all who seek peace, love, equality, and justice in America.""The move is likely to feed into tensions between the White House and social media, which escalated when Twitter added fact-checking tags to some of the President's tweets last week.The president subsequently signed an executive order seeking to curb legal protections offered to the industry.Twitter later hid one of the president's tweets for breaking its rules on ""glorifying violence"".Snapchat's action will also put further pressure on Facebook. Its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has resisted internal and external calls to intervene in regard to posts on its platform. Mr Zuckerberg has said the firm's free speech principles mean the president's posts should be left up unaltered.President Trump has more than one million followers on Snapchat, according to the Bloomberg news agency. It said the app is seen as being a ""key battleground"" by Mr Trump's re-election campaign because it offers a way to reach first-time voters.The president's account will not be suspended or deleted.However, the fact it will not feature in Discover means that his posts will only be seen by people who subscribe to or search for his account directly.....have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That’s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least. Many Secret Service agents just waiting for action. “We put the young ones on the front line, sir, they love it, and....End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpSnapchat based its decision on remarks Mr Trump had posted to Twitter rather than its own platform.On Monday, Snap's chief executive Evan Speigel had sent a memo to staff in which he detailed his views on the civil unrest sparked by the killing of George Floyd.""Every minute we are silent in the face of evil and wrongdoing we are acting in support of evildoers,"" Mr Speigel wrote.""As for Snapchat, we simply cannot promote accounts in America that are linked to people who incite racial violence, whether they do so on or off our platform.""""Our Discover content platform is a curated platform, where we decide what we promote,"" he added.",3 June 2020,technology
George Floyd death: Anti-racism sites hit by wave of cyber-attacks,"Cyber-attacks against anti-racism organisations shot up in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a leading provider of protection services says.Cloudflare, which blocks attacks designed to knock websites offline, says advocacy groups in general saw attacks increase 1,120-fold.Mr Floyd's death, in police custody, has sparked nationwide civil unrest in the US.Government and military websites also saw a notable increase in attacks.DDoS attacks - short for Distributed Denial of Service - are a relatively simple cyber-attack tool, in which the attacker tries to flood a website or other online service with so many fake ""users"" that it cannot cope.The effect is that it gets knocked offline for people trying to access information or services.Cloudflare says that after Mr Floyd's death and the ensuing violent clashes between police and protesters, it saw a noticeable jump in the amount of requests it blocked - an extra 19 billion (17%) from the corresponding weekend the previous month.That equates to an extra 110,000 blocked requests every second, it said.The problem was particularly acute for certain types of organisations. One single website belonging to an unnamed advocacy group dealt with 20,000 requests a second.Anti-racism groups which belong to Cloudflare's free programme for at-risk organisations saw a large surge in the past week, from near-zero to more than 120 million blocked requests.Attacks on government and military websites were also up - by 1.8 and 3.8 times respectively.It follows a sudden swell of interest in the ""hacktivist"" collective Anonymous, which has said it will support the protesters, and threatened to target the police in the city of Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed. The group has often used DDoS attacks in the past.Cloudflare, meanwhile, invited at-risk groups to join its free protection programme.""As we've often seen in the past, real world protest and violence is usually accompanied by attacks on the internet,"" Cloudflare said in a blog post written by its chief executive and chief technology officer.""Unfortunately, if recent history is any guide, those who speak out against oppression will continue to face cyber-attacks that attempt to silence them.""",3 June 2020,technology
