Didi Chuxing: Apple-backed firm aims for one million robotaxis,"Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing says it plans to operate more than a million self-driving vehicles by 2030.The robotaxis are to be deployed in places where ride-hailing drivers are less available, according to Meng Xing, Didi’s chief operating officer.Mr Meng was speaking at an online conference hosted by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper.One analyst suggested it was a very ambitious aim.“I’ll be surprised if we see a million by 2030,” a spokesman for market research firm Canalys said.“I hope that happens but there’s a lot to take place in meantime.”He pointed out that it was a strange time to make such a commitment, given the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.In 2016, US tech giant Apple ploughed $1bn (£800m) into Didi in an unusually large and public investment.Apple is known to be interested in the development of autonomous driving, having tested its own driverless vehicle on public roads in California in recent years. However, there was no reason to think that Apple’s autonomous driving research would expand as a result of Didi’s work in the area, Canalys suggested.Recently, Didi signed a deal with Chinese carmaker BAIC Group to jointly develop customised self-driving vehicles, and in May the firm received a $500m investment in its autonomous vehicles division from SoftBank.",23 June 2020,technology
Self-driving delivery van ditches 'human controls',"The first self-driving vehicle designed without basic human controls such as steering wheels, pedals or side view mirrors has been granted permission to test on US roads.Nuro, the company behind the design, makes autonomous delivery vans.The vehicle is Nuro's second generation of its vehicles, which it is calling R2 and will be tested in Houston, Texas.This is the first exemption to a rule requiring vehicles to have controls for human operators.Most of the rules for testing vehicles require features that allow a driver to safely take control of them.But in a statement, the US transport secretary Elaine Chao said given that the vehicle's top speed is capped at 25mph, these requirements ""no longer make sense"".The Department of Transportation (DoT) will also be enforcing greater oversight of the testing. It will require Nuro to report information about the operation of the R2 and reach out to the communities where the vehicle will be tested.In a blog post, Nuro's co-founder Dave Ferguson said the decision was a ""milestone for the industry"".""Moving forward, we must modernize the existing regulations that never envisioned a vehicle without a driver or occupants, and everyone in the industry must work to ensure self-driving technology is tested and deployed in the safest possible vehicles,"" he wrote.General Motors has also requested an exemption to test its self-driving Chevy Bolt. DoT has not yet announced its decision for the firm's request. The Bolt does however have a higher top speed than Nuro's R2 vehicle.Nuro's vehicles are designed to operate without a driver or passengers in them.In its R2 design, the company removed the side view mirrors and windscreens. It will also keep the rear view camera running at all times. This is not permitted without an exemption from the DoT, as the camera could distract human drivers.The vehicle has an egg-shaped frame that is smaller than most cars in the US. It also has two temperature-controlled compartments for deliveries. Doors raise up to reveal the items once a code has been entered by the recipient.The R2 uses radar, thermal imaging and 360-degree cameras to direct its movement.Nuro has announced the R2 will deliver pizza for Domino's Pizza,  groceries from supermarket chain Kroger and goods for Walmart, during its Huston trial.

UK's internet use surges to new highs during lockdown,"UK adults spent a quarter of their waking day online during lockdown - a record high, according to Ofcom.During April, adults spent an average of four hours a day online, up from three-and-a-half in September 2019, the communications watchdog said.And seven in 10 people made video calls at least once a week during lockdown, with millions turning to Zoom for the first time.The pandemic has radically changed online behaviour, said Ofcom.The regulator's Online Nation report found that people are seeking new ways to keep connected, informed, entertained and fit during lockdown.Twitch, the livestreaming platform for gamers, saw visitors increase from 2.3 million in January to 4.2 million in April.TikTok, which allows users to create and share short videos, reached 12.9 million UK visitors in April, up from 5.4 million in January.Much of Ofcom's report focused on people's online habits in September 2019, before the coronavirus struck.At that point, nine in 10 adults and almost all children spent time on platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram, according to the study.And nearly half of adults watch videos on such platforms several times a day, rising to 73% for children aged eight to 15.People are no longer just passive consumers, with two in five adults uploading videos to TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat or Instagram.What those aged 16+ watchVideo conferencing app Zoom has proved the big hit of lockdown - up from 659,000 users in January to 13 million in April as the nation turned to it to chat to family and friends, and take part in quizzes and games.The app has not been without controversy, with questions about how secure it was, with some people falling victim to zoom-bombing, where an uninvited guest joins a call to cause mischief or share unpleasant or hateful material.Even before the pandemic, people were moving away from landline calls and text messages in favour of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, the report indicates.Lockdown seems to have accelerated the adoption of such services. Nearly half of UK adults used WhatsApp to make video calls at least weekly, with Facebook Messenger not far behind on 41% and Apple's FaceTime being used by 30%.Ofcom's director of strategy and research Yih-Choung Teh said: ""Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy.

Apple Mac computers make jump to its own chips,"Apple has confirmed it will transition its Mac laptop and desktop computers to its own ARM-based processors.The move means that Macs will run on the same type of chips as the firm's iPhones and iPads, rather than Intel's.Intel had faced problems manufacturing its own designs, leading it to issue a public apology to computer-makers.Apple's challenge will be to carry off the transition smoothly and convince third-party developers to update their apps accordingly.""We expect to ship our first Mac with Apple silicon by the end of the year,"" said chief executive Tim Cook, adding that it would likely be two years before its full product line had made the jump.The firm said the move would allow it to offer new features and improved performance as well as making it easier for developers to ""write and optimise software for the entire Apple ecosystem"".The announcement was made at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).""Apple's motivations for doing this include reducing its dependence on Intel, maximizing its silicon investment, boosting performance and giving itself more flexibility and agility when it comes to future products,"" commented Geoff Blaber from the consultancy CCS Insight.""Embracing ARM and making its hardware more consistent across the iPhone, iPad and Mac ranges is a strategic necessity, but there will be inevitable bumps along the road.""Apple said it had already developed native versions of several of its own apps, including Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro.  iPhone and iPad apps will also be able to be run on the computers.Apple said that Microsoft was working on an optimised version of Office, and Adobe was developing a version of Photoshop.Other developers should be able to recompile their apps to get a version running ""in just a matter of days,"" said the company's software chief Craig Federighi. He added that old apps would automatically be translated at point of installation to run, although they would not work as well.To mark the significance of the move, MacOS will move to version 11. Since 2001, it had only moved from 10.0 to 10.15.Apple successfully made the switch from IBM-Motorola's PowerPC processors to Intel's x86 family in 2006.However, some software was never updated and cannot easily be run on today's Mac computers. Apple dropped support for running older software under emulation in the 2011 release of its Mac operating system.Microsoft already allows Windows 10 to be run on both Intel and ARM-based processors and looks set to continue supporting both chip architectures.Apple has not stated how long it will do the same. If new #ARM-based Macs will be able to run iPad apps, why shouldn’t future iPad hardware be able to run Mac apps? #wwdc20End of Twitter post  by @ianfogg42As a result, some people considering buying one of its laptop or desktop computers may decide to postpone a purchase until its first ARM-based computers go on sale.This could hit sales both at Apple and the development studios that make software for the platform.ARM-based chips are based on the designs of the UK-based company, which is headquartered in Cambridge. Other companies then adapt these to add capabilities of their own.Samsung, Qualcomm and Huawei are among the many other companies to do so.Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor, according to market research firm Gartner, coming behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell.The company has said that it has more than 100 million active Mac users. Back in June 2005, when it first announced the move to Intel chips, the figure was about 12.5 million.""Apple is approximately 4.5% of the laptop market and 2.6% of the desktop market, so the financial impact to Intel will not be significant,"" commented Gartner's Jon Erensen.""However, this transition... could give momentum to Microsoft's current efforts to run Windows on Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors."" Existing Mac owners will see changes to the next MacOS operating system - called Big Sur - which Apple said marked its biggest redesign to date. Analysis by James Clayton, North America technology reporterThe best way to describe a processor is the brain of the computer. Hardly surprising then that the processor in your computer is kind of important. Changing it is no small thing - and Apple hasn't decided this lightly.The big question though - and the one that if you're reading this you're probably more interested in - is what will this do for Macs in general?The prevailing view in Silicon Valley is moving to Apple silicon will make for more powerful Macs.Bringing it in-house could create cheaper processors - so in theory you could have cheaper Macs (that's if Apple wanted to pass on savings to the consumer). But there are risks too. The first is that Apple still has Intel-based Macs yet to come out. Will people simply wait for Apple's new processor to go live before choosing to buy a new computer? And - considering how well Mac products sell there will be a nervousness about changing a formula that has worked very well for Apple for the last 15 years. Other announcements at WWDC included the ability to use an iPhone as a substitute for a car key by transmitting an NFC (near-field communication) signal to unlock doors and start the engine.This will initially be limited to some new BMWs, but the firm said it intended to expand to other models in time.Sad to say I am not changing my car to use my iPhone as a key but I am sure #BMW customers are interested in this given #Samsung got a lot of traction with it #WWDC20 pic.twitter.com/JXsWcuajZmEnd of Twitter post  by @caro_milanesiApp developers will also have to provide more information about the data they gather about users, so that Apple can display a summary to them before they install the software.By surfacing apps wanting your location or to track you, Apple is educating consumers and heightening their awareness of the situation. Creates more interest and desire for their privacy stance.End of Twitter post  by @BenBajarinOne of the biggest changes to the iPhone's iOS14 operating system will be a shake-up of the home screen.Apps can now be automatically organised into folders containing:In addition, the firm is updating its ""widgets"" - blocks that display a stripped-down, small app window - so that they can be placed among the icons for other programs. Examples included weather forecasts, news briefings, and calendar meetings. Android already has something similar.Another Android-like new feature is the introduction of App Clips, which allow part of a program to be downloaded quickly. These must be less than 10 megabytes in size and will be able to be triggered via an NFC-transmission or by scanning a QR code. Suggested uses included the ability to order a drink in a cafe or to pay for a car-parking space.Apple is also releasing a new app called Translate that carries out language translations offline, offering an alternative to Google Translate.It will support 11 languages to begin with including English, Mandarin, French, German, and Arabic.#iOS14 leverages UI ideas from past #android releases, but only in a more elegant way @Apple #WWDCEnd of Twitter post  by @waynesworldFor the first time, users will be able to set third-party email and web browser apps as the default in iOS, rather than Apple's own software.The UK and Ireland will be among countries given access to an overhauled version of its Maps app, which provides more detailed views of roads and paths than before - as well as new cycling directions and routes for electric cars that pass charging stations.And its MeMoji cartoon-like characters now feature new styling options, including the addition of protective face masks.Apple's tablet operating system iPadOS will also benefit from several enhancements to its Pencil stylus.These include:The next version of WatchOS adds sleep-tracking functionality to the firm's smartwatch - which will be based on a user's movements in bed.It also adds the ability to determine when the owner is washing their hands, in order to confirm whether they have done so for long enough to help protect against Covid-19.It wouldn't surprise me if the new hand-washing app on Apple Watch and face mask Memojis emerges as some of the big stories of WWDC.

The Activity app - which is now renamed Fitness - will track calories used for various dance styles.Apple's AirPod Pro earphones will gain spatial audio to recreate a cinema-style surround sound experience. They will also automatically switch between a user's Apple devices as the owner moves from one to another.And the firm's Apple TV set-top box will soon allow compatible third-party video doorbells to live-stream footage of visitors to television screens, while iOS 14 will make it possible to use facial recognition to identify them.This will only work with members of the owner's family and friends, who need to be tagged in advance.It has also emerged that Apple TV's YouTube app will play clips in 4K for the first time, ending a stand-off with Google over the video-encoding technology involved.",22 June 2020,technology
"Fines to be part of regulating social media, says Ofcom","Ofcom will not hesitate to impose fines on social media firms who fail to deal with harmful content, its new boss has said.The watchdog would also consider temporarily suspending platforms in extreme cases of harm.Chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes set out the powers Ofcom would use if, as expected, it is appointed as regulator.She was responding to questions from MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.The government has not yet announced which body will be given the role of overseeing content on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Google, although Ofcom is the most likely candidate.The new regulator will have powers to impose penalties on a range of content including bullying, child abuse, terrorism and fake news.""Fines need to be part of the regime. These are extremely large companies with significant financial muscle,"" she told MPs.France recently passed a law that requires social media to remove hate speech and illegal content within one hour or face heavy fines.Dame Dawes acknowledged that regulating Facebook, Twitter and Facebook would be a ""big challenge""  but promised that if Ofcom was appointed to the role, it would ""shine a light"" and ""hold them to account"", she told MPs.She said it would require the recruitment of data analysts, and revealed ""someone from Google"" had already been appointed.But she acknowledged that finding the right skilled people would be a challenge, and it would be hard to persuade people to move from well-paid private sector jobs to a public sector role.The DCMS committee had previously heard from social media companies on how they were dealing with online harm, and expressed frustration at the actions they had taken to deal with misinformation around Covid-19.Dame Dawes was kinder in her assessment, borrowing an analogy from the virologists when she said that the ""R number"" for viral misinformation had been kept down by social media firms with a range of new measures.This included Facebook's decision to limit the amount of content that could be forwarded via WhatsApp, and Twitter's decision to limit the sharing of articles by users who had not read them.Several MPs wanted to know how Ofcom would keep children safe online, and in particular whether the regulator would monitor images of self-harm.The case of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who killed herself after viewing self-harm images on Instagram, put the issue into sharp relief and helped convinced the government that it needed to appoint a social media regulator.Dame Dawes did not rule out the possibility of legal action against social media firms, including so-called super-complaints potentially launched with the help of charities such as the NSPCC.She was also asked whether the watchdog would look at limiting the amount of time children were online, but said it would be difficult to provide a definitive figure on how much time was too much.She also refused to be drawn on the issue of foreign interference on social networks but she did say that anonymous accounts on Twitter, which could be Russian bots, was an area that needed to be examined.""We need to know a lot more about the behaviour of anonymous accounts. Transparency at the moment is just not good enough,"" she said.Dame Dawes, who was appointed to her post three weeks before the UK went into lockdown, said that the pandemic had thrown up three major challenges for the regulator:She said that networks had ""largely"" performed well overall.And she added that public broadcasters had done ""a good job"" in keeping the nation entertained, informed and educated during lockdown.She also revealed that Ofcom research suggested that 12- to 15-year-olds used the BBC as their ""first source"" for news.Dame Dawes was appointed to the Ofcom role in February. Previously she was permanent secretary at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.",23 June 2020,technology
Apple makes concessions to App Store developers,"Apple is to give developers more leeway in disputes regarding apps that have fallen foul of its App Store rules.The company will allow developers accused of violating its guidelines to launch an appeal.And updates to apps that fix minor problems will no longer be delayed by these disputes.The changes follow a public row between Apple and Basecamp, the developers of Hey, an email app at the centre of an App Store dispute.Their timing coincides with Apple's week-long Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), at which it is seeking app-makers' help in switching its Mac platform to a different type of chip.Apple’s App Store is where nearly all iPhone and iPad users acquire apps for their devices.But Apple has long retained the right to decide when apps should be suspended or even pulled from the App Store, based on its strict guidelines.And it halted an update to Hey, saying its $99 (£78) annual subscription should be available to purchase inside the app instead of on an external website only. But Basecamp said it ""won't ever do IAP [in-app purchases]"" and neither did other apps, such as Netflix.And  it is now offering a two-week free trial within Hey, to fulfil Apple's requirement for apps to ""work"" immediately on being downloaded.The stand-off also sparked a wider debate about Apple's pricing policies.On Tuesday, Basecamp’s chief technology officer, David Heinemeier Hansson, tweeted Apple's decision to relax its rules was ""pretty significant"" but the exact nature of its future relationship with developers needed further clarity.“I really do hope Apple is serious about reform,” he said.“There's a path forward here, where Apple goes back to being a friend of developers not a big bully they're all terrified of speaking out against.”Many developers have issues with the cut Apple takes from app revenues.But nearly all, especially the small ones, grumble in private rather than offend the mighty company on which their livelihoods depend. Basecamp was different, coming out punching when Apple threatened to bar the app, and using words such as ""outrageous"" and ""abuse"". At another time, Apple might have swatted the company away.But the risk of the row overshadowing WWDC and diluting its messages was too great. So before the keynote, it moved quietly to make peace with Basecamp.And afterwards, even more quietly, it made a few tweaks to its deal with developers.But this isn’t over. With the EU mounting an investigation into the App Store and other bigger developers spoiling for a fight, Apple may have to give further ground.",23 June 2020,technology
Mixer: Microsoft abandons gaming app in Facebook deal,"Microsoft has decided to close its Mixer livestreaming service and is partnering with Facebook Gaming instead.Mixer made headlines last year when it signed a reportedly multi-million dollar exclusivity deal with Ninja, a big star on rival platform Twitch.But despite the investment, Microsoft says the platform will close in one month's time.Ninja and other major gamers will no longer be tied to exclusivity deals.Ninja had been signed to Mixer for less than a year.From 22 July, Mixer's website and app will redirect users to Facebook Gaming.As part of the deal, Microsoft will work to bring its xCloud games-streaming service to Facebook.""This seems quite ruthless, but Microsoft's strategy to reach more gamers is underpinned by its cloud business, not Mixer,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls from the consultancy Ampere Analysis.""Clearly Facebook has significant reach globally, to expose users to xCloud.""All games-streamers in Mixer's partner programme will be granted partner status on Facebook Gaming if they wish to move to the platform.""Ultimately, the success of partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent on our ability to scale the platform for them as quickly and broadly as possible,"" Mixer said in a statement.""It became clear that the time needed to grow our own livestreaming community to scale was out of measure with the vision and experiences that Microsoft and Xbox want to deliver for gamers now, so we've decided to close the operations side of Mixer and help the community transition to a new platform.""In a separate blog post, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said the transition deal was part of a wider agreement between Xbox and Facebook, with Xbox aiming to introduce gaming features that work on Facebook and Instagram in the future.Those partnered streamers who do choose to move to Facebook Gaming can begin the process by filling out a form, Mixer said that Facebook ""will honour and match all existing Partner agreements as closely as possible"".Facebook said it was ""proud to invite everyone in the Mixer community to Facebook Gaming"".The company promised streamers: ""We'll do everything we can to make the transition as easy as possible for those who decide to make the switch.""i",22 June 2020,technology
Last of Us Part II: Is this the most accessible game ever?,"The first time Steve Saylor fired up the hotly-anticipated new game The Last of Us Part II, he burst into tears. ""Y'all don't even know how much..."" he says between sobs in his video of the moment, which has now had nearly half a million views.""I'm sorry. I don't even know what to say."" Steve is legally blind, and was looking at the overwhelming accessibility options menu.Courtney Craven, editor of accessibility-focused gaming site Can I Play That, is hard of hearing and has some motor-control issues, and had a similar reaction. ""The first thing I did upon launching [the game] for the first time was FaceTime a friend and cry,"" she says.The game has already been dubbed ""the most accessible game ever"". It has more than 60 different accessibility settings, allowing an unprecedented level of customisation and fine-tuning.Every button can be changed, and one-handed control schemes are available by default. Players like Courtney can turn on direction arrows on subtitles to indicate where the sound is coming from; players like Steve can outline characters and enemies in vivid colours.Steve, who goes by the name ""Blind Gamer"" online, has nystagmus - an involuntary eye movement that blurs his vision. Ever since he was a child playing the original Nintendo Entertainment System, he has had to sit extremely close to the screen, and his reflexes haven't always fitted into what modern games expect.""For the first time in my entire life, I was able to sit back on the couch and play the game without any barriers getting in the way."" he says. ""I was able to sit comfortably and play a game  just like if my friends were in the room playing with me. And that, to me, was extremely opening. It was emotional.""In the interest of honesty, Steve is keen to let people know that he did consult with the game's developer, Naughty Dog, when they were exploring accessibility issues.Courtney, meanwhile, suffers from being surprised by enemies that she is expected to hear, among other things.""So many games have directional audio with characters saying things like, 'over here!'"" she explains.""Hearing players can follow the direction of the voice but I'm often standing there like: 'Uhhh, where is here?'"" Game accessibility has come a long way in recent years, but gamers largely depend on individual developers to decide how much - or how few - accessibility options to include. In recent years, a willingness by major developers such as Ubisoft to incorporate accessibility into the early stages of big-budget game design has helped push the subject forward.In 2015, the Playstation 4 became the first major system to allow re-mapping of controller buttons at a system level, rather than relying on developers to include the option in their games. For many people with motor or dexterity impairments, that opened up the possibility of playing games that may previously have been unplayable.A watershed moment came in 2018, with the release of Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller - a customisable unit which allowed disabled gamers to use a wide range of assistive devices such as switches and bite pedals. But it only solves problems for those who have trouble using a standard controller. And big titles still come in for criticism from the community. Activision's Spyro Reignited Trilogy was criticised when it was released without subtitles in its cut-scenes - while CD Projekt Red had to release a patch for blockbuster game The Witcher 3 to enable players to adjust the font size.It is against that kind of backdrop that many are calling this latest success ""the most accessible game ever"".""We're going to look back on this and [see] everything for accessibility before The Last of Us Part II, and after,"" Steve says.Courtney, who founded Can I Play That in November 2018 to focus on gaming accessibility, says the effort is unprecedented.""A lot of games do some of these things. None of them have done all of them until now,"" she says. She hopes this game will be a blueprint for others to follow - and thinks there are rewards for developers who do.""I think the monetary payoff will really be obvious,"" she says. ""So many people have told me that Can I Play That's coverage of it was the deciding factor in them buying the game"".But more importantly, she urged people to ""make accessible games because you should. It's the right thing to do.""Steve puts it simply: ""It just makes their game that much better.""He points to friends without a diagnosed disability who told him their experience was made better by using some of the same options.And he believes that this is the beginning of a new wave of advancement to come in the next decade.""Obviously, the more accessible it can be the more that people can play, and that just means more dollars,"" he says, pointing to a vast untapped audience.""And as a developer, they want everyone to be able to play their game, so why not make it so that it's accessible to those players?""",21 June 2020,technology
UK's internet use surges to new highs during lockdown,"UK adults spent a quarter of their waking day online during lockdown - a record high, according to Ofcom.During April, adults spent an average of four hours a day online, up from three-and-a-half in September 2019, the communications watchdog said.And seven in 10 people made video calls at least once a week during lockdown, with millions turning to Zoom for the first time.The pandemic has radically changed online behaviour, said Ofcom.The regulator's Online Nation report found that people are seeking new ways to keep connected, informed, entertained and fit during lockdown.Twitch, the livestreaming platform for gamers, saw visitors increase from 2.3 million in January to 4.2 million in April.TikTok, which allows users to create and share short videos, reached 12.9 million UK visitors in April, up from 5.4 million in January.Much of Ofcom's report focused on people's online habits in September 2019, before the coronavirus struck.At that point, nine in 10 adults and almost all children spent time on platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram, according to the study.And nearly half of adults watch videos on such platforms several times a day, rising to 73% for children aged eight to 15.People are no longer just passive consumers, with two in five adults uploading videos to TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat or Instagram.What those aged 16+ watchVideo conferencing app Zoom has proved the big hit of lockdown - up from 659,000 users in January to 13 million in April as the nation turned to it to chat to family and friends, and take part in quizzes and games.The app has not been without controversy, with questions about how secure it was, with some people falling victim to zoom-bombing, where an uninvited guest joins a call to cause mischief or share unpleasant or hateful material.Even before the pandemic, people were moving away from landline calls and text messages in favour of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, the report indicates.Lockdown seems to have accelerated the adoption of such services. Nearly half of UK adults used WhatsApp to make video calls at least weekly, with Facebook Messenger not far behind on 41% and Apple's FaceTime being used by 30%.Ofcom's director of strategy and research Yih-Choung Teh said: ""Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy. Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.""People remain wary about online safety though, with 87% of adults saying that they had concerns over children using video-sharing websites and other apps.",24 June 2020,technology
Didi Chuxing: Apple-backed firm aims for one million robotaxis,"Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing says it plans to operate more than a million self-driving vehicles by 2030.The robotaxis are to be deployed in places where ride-hailing drivers are less available, according to Meng Xing, Didi’s chief operating officer.Mr Meng was speaking at an online conference hosted by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper.One analyst suggested it was a very ambitious aim.“I’ll be surprised if we see a million by 2030,” a spokesman for market research firm Canalys said.“I hope that happens but there’s a lot to take place in meantime.”He pointed out that it was a strange time to make such a commitment, given the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.In 2016, US tech giant Apple ploughed $1bn (£800m) into Didi in an unusually large and public investment.Apple is known to be interested in the development of autonomous driving, having tested its own driverless vehicle on public roads in California in recent years. However, there was no reason to think that Apple’s autonomous driving research would expand as a result of Didi’s work in the area, Canalys suggested.Recently, Didi signed a deal with Chinese carmaker BAIC Group to jointly develop customised self-driving vehicles, and in May the firm received a $500m investment in its autonomous vehicles division from SoftBank.",23 June 2020,technology
