Apple Mac computers make jump to its own chips,"Apple has confirmed it will transition its Mac laptop and desktop computers to its own ARM-based processors.The move means that Macs will run on the same type of chips as the firm's iPhones and iPads, rather than Intel's.Intel had faced problems manufacturing its own designs, leading it to issue a public apology to computer-makers.Apple's challenge will be to carry off the transition smoothly and convince third-party developers to update their apps accordingly.""We expect to ship our first Mac with Apple silicon by the end of the year,"" said chief executive Tim Cook, adding that it would likely be two years before its full product line had made the jump.The firm said the move would allow it to offer new features and improved performance as well as making it easier for developers to ""write and optimise software for the entire Apple ecosystem"".The announcement was made at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).""Apple's motivations for doing this include reducing its dependence on Intel, maximizing its silicon investment, boosting performance and giving itself more flexibility and agility when it comes to future products,"" commented Geoff Blaber from the consultancy CCS Insight.""Embracing ARM and making its hardware more consistent across the iPhone, iPad and Mac ranges is a strategic necessity, but there will be inevitable bumps along the road.""Apple said it had already developed native versions of several of its own apps, including Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro.  iPhone and iPad apps will also be able to be run on the computers.Apple said that Microsoft was working on an optimised version of Office, and Adobe was developing a version of Photoshop.Other developers should be able to recompile their apps to get a version running ""in just a matter of days,"" said the company's software chief Craig Federighi. He added that old apps would automatically be translated at point of installation to run, although they would not work as well.To mark the significance of the move, MacOS will move to version 11. Since 2001, it had only moved from 10.0 to 10.15.Apple successfully made the switch from IBM-Motorola's PowerPC processors to Intel's x86 family in 2006.However, some software was never updated and cannot easily be run on today's Mac computers. Apple dropped support for running older software under emulation in the 2011 release of its Mac operating system.Microsoft already allows Windows 10 to be run on both Intel and ARM-based processors and looks set to continue supporting both chip architectures.Apple has not stated how long it will do the same. As a result, some people considering buying one of its laptop or desktop computers may decide to postpone a purchase until its first ARM-based computers go on sale.This could hit sales both at Apple and the development studios that make software for the platform.ARM-based chips are based on the designs of the UK-based company, which is headquartered in Cambridge. Other companies then adapt these to add capabilities of their own.Samsung, Qualcomm and Huawei are among the many other companies to do so.Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor, according to market research firm Gartner, coming behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell.The company has said that it has more than 100 million active Mac users. Back in June 2005, when it first announced the move to Intel chips, the figure was about 12.5 million.""Apple is approximately 4.5% of the laptop market and 2.6% of the desktop market, so the financial impact to Intel will not be significant,"" commented Gartner's Jon Erensen.""However, this transition... could give momentum to Microsoft's current efforts to run Windows on Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors."" Existing Mac owners will see changes to the next MacOS operating system - called Big Sur - which Apple said marked its biggest redesign to date. Analysis by James Clayton, North America technology reporterThe best way to describe a processor is the brain of the computer. Hardly surprising then that the processor in your computer is kind of important. Changing it is no small thing - and Apple hasn't decided this lightly.The big question though - and the one that if you're reading this you're probably more interested in - is what will this do for Macs in general?The prevailing view in Silicon Valley is moving to Apple silicon will make for more powerful Macs.Bringing it in-house could create cheaper processors - so in theory you could have cheaper Macs (that's if Apple wanted to pass on savings to the consumer). But there are risks too. The first is that Apple still has Intel-based Macs yet to come out. Will people simply wait for Apple's new processor to go live before choosing to buy a new computer? And - considering how well Mac products sell there will be a nervousness about changing a formula that has worked very well for Apple for the last 15 years. Other announcements at WWDC included the ability to use an iPhone as a substitute for a car key by transmitting an NFC (near-field communication) signal to unlock doors and start the engine.This will initially be limited to some new BMWs, but the firm said it intended to expand to other models in time.Sad to say I am not changing my car to use my iPhone as a key but I am sure #BMW customers are interested in this given #Samsung got a lot of traction with it #WWDC20 pic.twitter.com/JXsWcuajZmEnd of Twitter post  by @caro_milanesiApp developers will also have to provide more information about the data they gather about users, so that Apple can display a summary to them before they install the software.By surfacing apps wanting your location or to track you, Apple is educating consumers and heightening their awareness of the situation.

Apple's annual developer showcase overshadowed by app row,"Apple is facing mounting pressure over how it runs its app store ahead of its major global developers' conference, which starts on Monday.The firm has been accused of creating ""hostile"" policies within its fee structure, and is dealing with two EU competition probes announced this week.But it is also embroiled in a row with some of its own developers.That has now widened into a debate involving politicians and other major technology firms. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference often features new product announcements but is mainly an event for software developers working on Apple's platforms - some of whom are now voicing discontent about its pricing.The argument was ignited in part by an email app called Hey, created by developer David Heinemeier Hansson. It had an update rejected by the Apple app store early this week because it does not allow in-app purchases - from which Apple takes a 30% cut.Many developers do not offer in-app subscriptions to avoid that levy - or raise the price of in-app subscriptions for the end user.But not all apps are affected, Mr Hansson says. He pointed to email apps from Gmail and Microsoft's Outlook, which he says are treated differently, but which Apple would not discuss with him. Hey's annual subscription of $99 (¬£80) is available only directly from the company online, and the app does not tell users where to buy it - so the firm believed it was following all the rules, similar to other email apps.But Apple told him the app should never have been approved in the first place - and could be removed.""If we don't like the deal Apple is offering us - which is to either pay them 30% or get kicked out - what are we going to do about that? Where are we going to go?"" he told the BBC.""If you launch a new piece of software today, and you're not available on the iPhone, you're invisible.""The cry has now been taken up by others, including blogger John Gruber, whose blog, Daring Fireball, is widely read among Apple developers. He wrote that if Hey's issues were not a mistake, the decision was ""outrageous"".Such issues are behind an anti-competition probe announced by the EU this week, prompted by a complaint from Spotify. The Swedish firm also takes issue with Apple's approach to charging subscriptions and the cut it takes.The anti-competition probe, coinciding with the row over Hey's business model, has snowballed into a much bigger argument.Microsoft President Brad Smith entered the debate, saying that regulators on both sides of the Atlantic should have a ""focused conversation"" about app stores and the rules in place - though he did not mention Apple by name.Microsoft has itself been the subject of competition probes, hit with hefty fines over its dominant market position with Microsoft Windows and its web browser.But he said the restrictions and demands placed on developers today are far higher than anything that existed 20 years ago, at the height of Microsoft's software dominance.Facebook, meanwhile, told the New York Times that its Gaming app had been rejected from Apple's app store five times.Sources who spoke to the newspaper said it might be because the app offers simple games that do not have to be downloaded in the traditional way - through Apple's store.Even the chairman of the House antitrust committee - the group of politicians that deals with competition law in the United States - has voiced his concern.""Because of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents - highway robbery, basically - bullying people to pay 30% or denying access to their market,"" David Cicilline told The Verge.""It's crushing small developers who simply can't survive with those kinds of payments.

Apple claims 'half a trillion dollars' App Store economy,"Apple has said that its App Store ecosystem ""facilitated half a trillion dollars"" of trade in 2019.The firm said more than 85% of that figure occurred via transactions from which it did not take a commission.The announcement comes at a time Apple and other US tech giants are facing increased anti-competition scrutiny.A leading developer has also called on the iPhone-maker to lower the fees it charges, ahead of its annual developers' conference next week.An Apple representative told the BBC that it was proud of the commerce that it had enabled and welcomed scrutiny of its App Store.The study was commissioned by Apple but carried out by economists at the Boston-based consultancy Analysis Group.It surveyed billings and sales related to apps running on the tech firm's iOS, Mac, Watch and Apple TV platforms.This included:The report attempted to account for spending that occurred externally but led to content being used within an app - for example a direct payment to Spotify, whose songs were then listened to via its iPhone app.Likewise it subtracted a proportion of the charge of in-app purchases whose content was used elsewhere - for example a Now TV subscription taken out via Sky's app, if most of the shows were then watched directly on a TV's own app.In total, the economists said $519bn (¬£406bn) had been generated via Apple's software ecosystem. The figure excludes sales generated by the Android and Windows versions of the same products. Physical goods and offline services accounted for the biggest share of the sum - $413bn.By contrast, digital goods and services - from which Apple typically takes a 30% cut - accounted for $61bn.(Sales in billions of dollars)The study's publications coincides with a call by the US House Judiciary Committee for Apple's chief executive Tim Cook and other tech leaders to answer questions about anti-trust concerns, according to reports.News site Axios said on Friday that the committee also planned to compel Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook to disclose internal documents about their digital markets if they did not share them voluntarily.And in Europe, Rakuten's e-book division Kobo and the music streaming service Spotify are both urging the European Commission to carry out its own investigation into the fact the US company takes a cut from in-app fees while running competing platforms of its own - Apple Books and Apple Music.Apple plans to host its Worldwide Developers Conference next week. Ahead of the event, a leading software developer published his own list of concerns about Apple's business practices.Among changes called for by Wil Shipley - who co-founded Omni Group before going on to run Delicious Monster Software - were:""Apple has a market cap of about $1.5tn and it extracts more margin than any other company from the mobile phone market,"" commented Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight.""It's keen to remind people that it has had to work to build this platform.

Apple claims 'half a trillion dollars' App Store economy,"Apple has said that its App Store ecosystem ""facilitated half a trillion dollars"" of trade in 2019.The firm said more than 85% of that figure occurred via transactions from which it did not take a commission.The announcement comes at a time Apple and other US tech giants are facing increased anti-competition scrutiny.A leading developer has also called on the iPhone-maker to lower the fees it charges, ahead of its annual developers' conference next week.An Apple representative told the BBC that it was proud of the commerce that it had enabled and welcomed scrutiny of its App Store.The study was commissioned by Apple but carried out by economists at the Boston-based consultancy Analysis Group.It surveyed billings and sales related to apps running on the tech firm's iOS, Mac, Watch and Apple TV platforms.This included:The report attempted to account for spending that occurred externally but led to content being used within an app - for example a direct payment to Spotify, whose songs were then listened to via its iPhone app.Likewise it subtracted a proportion of the charge of in-app purchases whose content was used elsewhere - for example a Now TV subscription taken out via Sky's app, if most of the shows were then watched directly on a TV's own app.In total, the economists said $519bn (¬£406bn) had been generated via Apple's software ecosystem. The figure excludes sales generated by the Android and Windows versions of the same products. Physical goods and offline services accounted for the biggest share of the sum - $413bn.By contrast, digital goods and services - from which Apple typically takes a 30% cut - accounted for $61bn.(Sales in billions of dollars)The study's publications coincides with a call by the US House Judiciary Committee for Apple's chief executive Tim Cook and other tech leaders to answer questions about anti-trust concerns, according to reports.News site Axios said on Friday that the committee also planned to compel Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook to disclose internal documents about their digital markets if they did not share them voluntarily.And in Europe, Rakuten's e-book division Kobo and the music streaming service Spotify are both urging the European Commission to carry out its own investigation into the fact the US company takes a cut from in-app fees while running competing platforms of its own - Apple Books and Apple Music.Apple plans to host its Worldwide Developers Conference next week.

Mixer: Microsoft abandons gaming app in Facebook deal,"Microsoft has decided to close its Mixer livestreaming service and is partnering with Facebook Gaming instead.Mixer made headlines last year when it signed a reportedly multi-million dollar exclusivity deal with Ninja, a big star on rival platform Twitch.But despite the investment, Microsoft says the platform will close in one month's time.Ninja and other major gamers will no longer be tied to exclusivity deals.Ninja had been signed to Mixer for less than a year.From 22 July, Mixer's website and app will redirect users to Facebook Gaming.As part of the deal, Microsoft will work to bring its xCloud games-streaming service to Facebook.""This seems quite ruthless, but Microsoft's strategy to reach more gamers is underpinned by its cloud business, not Mixer,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls from the consultancy Ampere Analysis.""Clearly Facebook has significant reach globally, to expose users to xCloud.""All games-streamers in Mixer's partner programme will be granted partner status on Facebook Gaming if they wish to move to the platform.""Ultimately, the success of partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent on our ability to scale the platform for them as quickly and broadly as possible,"" Mixer said in a statement.""It became clear that the time needed to grow our own livestreaming community to scale was out of measure with the vision and experiences that Microsoft and Xbox want to deliver for gamers now, so we've decided to close the operations side of Mixer and help the community transition to a new platform.""In a separate blog post, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said the transition deal was part of a wider agreement between Xbox and Facebook, with Xbox aiming to introduce gaming features that work on Facebook and Instagram in the future.Those partnered streamers who do choose to move to Facebook Gaming can begin the process by filling out a form, Mixer said that Facebook ""will honour and match all existing Partner agreements as closely as possible"".Facebook said it was ""proud to invite everyone in the Mixer community to Facebook Gaming"".The company promised streamers: ""We'll do everything we can to make the transition as easy as possible for those who decide to make the switch.""i",22 June 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Ireland set to launch contact-trace app,"Ireland's health authority plans to press ahead with the launch of a coronavirus contact-tracing app based on Apple and Google's technology.The Health Service Executive told the BBC that it would submit a memo to government this week, and ""subject to approval"" would launch its Covid Tracker app shortly after.The move comes despite concerns raised about the tech's accuracy in its current state. The UK is worried about false alerts.And researchers advising the Irish effort have also questioned whether the software should be rolled out in its current state.Ireland would follow Germany in deploying such an app nationwide.Two tests were carried out in Ireland ahead of the launch of its app.Members of the An Garda Siochana police force volunteered to take part in field trials at the start of the month to see how it would perform in everyday situations.""The Gardai are one of the few groups of people that are moving around and interacting with each other as they carry out their duties,"" explained a spokeswoman for the country's government.The results have given health chiefs confidence to roll it out to the public.And they note that because it has been designed to support UK mobile numbers, visitors crossing the border from Northern Ireland or travelling across from Great Britain can also make use if it.The second experiment involved a team at Trinity College, Dublin testing an app based on the Google-Apple API [application programming interface] on a commuter bus.It found that metal in the vehicle's structure and fittings caused problems.The Google-API allows the threshold for what triggers a contact match to be adjusted based on the strength of the Bluetooth signal and duration of the exposure.When using the settings already in use by Switzerland's contact-tracing app, the researchers found that no contact logs were logged despite 60 pairs of handsets being placed within 2m of each other.And they only managed to raise this to an 8% detection rate when they shortened the exposure time and adjusted the Bluetooth strength to a level that they said would be likely to cause false alerts in other environments.In addition, the researchers said signal strength was sometimes higher for phones that were far apart than those close together, which they said made reliable proximity-detection ""hard or perhaps even impossible"" to achieve.""As to whether it is sensible to deploy these apps, I'd say the jury is still out on that,"" Prof Doug Leith told the BBC.""But the likely effectiveness of apps based on the Apple-Google API in real-world situations  -ie outside the lab - is certainly far from clear."" Last week, the UK ditched its own contact-tracing technology to switch to the Apple-Google model.But while the government now intends to launch a Covid-19 app of some sort in England by the Autumn, it has said it may still not include contact-tracing functionality.""I was only prepared to recommend to people that they download an app when I'm really confident in it,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.Apple and Google are under pressure to become less restrictive about the data they share to let apps become more accurate.""The API does not expose Bluetooth received signal strength (RSS) measurements directly, rather it abstracts this,"" explained Dr Brendan Jennings, who is also involved in developing Ireland's app.""There certainly are some changes in the API that we believe would be helpful - and we do believe that Google/Apple will be willing to take on board suggested changes in future revisions.""But in the meantime, others have already decided to launch apps based on the two US tech firms' software tool, including:One of the developers of Germany's app said it was currently 80% accurate at logging matches across a range of scenarios, and it had been felt that this was good enough to go with.""There can be false alerts,"" added SAP's Thomas Leonhardi.""But that can also happen via manual contact tracing. It's the best we have and of course we're still working on it.""The Robert Koch Institute, which published the Corona-Warn App on behalf of the German government, said on Friday morning that it had already been downloaded 9.6 million times. The country's population is about 83 million.Once Ireland has got an app based on the Apple/Google toolkit up and running then Northern Ireland and indeed the rest of the UK should be able to use it - job done, right?Well, no, say insiders on the NHS team. First, an app is more than just the code - you would need to integrate it with the public health advice, the testing infrastructure and the manual contact-tracing systems for each of the four home nations. But the key issue is the question of whether the Apple/Google system is actually working well at measuring the distance between two phones using Bluetooth - last Thursday Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Test and Trace supremo Baroness Dido Harding made it clear they thought it wasn't.Incidentally, Baroness Harding may have overstated the failings of the centralised app in the Isle of Wight during Thursday's briefings when she said it could only detect 4% of iPhone contacts.Someone on the island who was briefed about what went wrong tells me that this disastrous 4% only referred to cases where the app was asleep in the background after a long period when two iPhones had not been in use for a while - which apparently accounts for just a small percentage of overall iPhone contacts.What's frustrated both the app team and Apple is that in the days before the U-turn, the two sides had apparently begun working closely on ways to make Bluetooth work better with the app in the background. Thursday's announcement came as a surprise to the developers and to the tech giant - which was then dismayed to hear Mr Hancock accusing it of a failure to co-operate.",22 June 2020,technology
The North Face and Patagonia boycott Facebook ads,"Outdoor brands The North Face, Patagonia and Rei have pulled their advertising from Facebook platforms.The Stop Hate For Profits campaign is calling on brands to join the boycott during the month of July.The North Face said it was halting ads ""until stricter policies are put in place to stop racist, violent or hateful content and misinformation from circulating on the platform.""Facebook said it was committed to ""advancing equity and racial justice"". ""We're taking steps to review our policies, ensure diversity and transparency when making decisions on how we apply our policies, and advance racial justice and voter engagement on our platform,"" it said in a long post, published on Sunday.Patagonia said it would also be joining the boycott until ""at least the end of July"". Patagonia is proud to join the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. We will pull all ads on Facebook and Instagram, effective immediately, through at least the end of July, pending meaningful action from the social media giant.End of Twitter post  by @patagoniaA spokesman for VF Corp, which owns The North Face, told CNN it was considering adding other brands in its portfolio to the boycott - it also owns Timberland and Vans.Facebook has faced heavy criticism, including from its own staff, for chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's decision not to remove a controversial post by US President Donald Trump.The same message was also shared on Twitter, where it was hidden behind a warning label on the grounds that it ""glorified violence"".Joseph Evans, head of tech at Enders Analysis, said Facebook was trying to both avoid further regulation from the US government, and maintain ad revenue. ""Facebook can weather a boycott by large companies better than any other media organisation out there, as so much of its revenue comes from smaller advertisers who are unlikely to band together to make political demands,"" he said. ""However, right now, lots of those small advertisers are under pressure due to Covid-19 drying up their cashflow. So we could be seeing a perfect storm.""What I expect to see is Facebook trying to walk a tightrope: interpreting its existing guidelines slightly more strictly, erring more on the side of taking down hate speech, but without much in the way of explicit policy changes that could provoke punitive regulations or get Mark Zuckerberg dragged before another Senate Committee.""",22 June 2020,technology
Apple Mac computers make jump to its own chips,"Apple has confirmed it will transition its Mac laptop and desktop computers to its own ARM-based processors.The move means that Macs will run on the same type of chips as the firm's iPhones and iPads, rather than Intel's.Intel had faced problems manufacturing its own designs, leading it to issue a public apology to computer-makers.Apple's challenge will be to carry off the transition smoothly and convince third-party developers to update their apps accordingly.""We expect to ship our first Mac with Apple silicon by the end of the year,"" said chief executive Tim Cook, adding that it would likely be two years before its full product line had made the jump.The firm said the move would allow it to offer new features and improved performance as well as making it easier for developers to ""write and optimise software for the entire Apple ecosystem"".The announcement was made at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).""Apple's motivations for doing this include reducing its dependence on Intel, maximizing its silicon investment, boosting performance and giving itself more flexibility and agility when it comes to future products,"" commented Geoff Blaber from the consultancy CCS Insight.""Embracing ARM and making its hardware more consistent across the iPhone, iPad and Mac ranges is a strategic necessity, but there will be inevitable bumps along the road.""Apple said it had already developed native versions of several of its own apps, including Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro.  iPhone and iPad apps will also be able to be run on the computers.Apple said that Microsoft was working on an optimised version of Office, and Adobe was developing a version of Photoshop.Other developers should be able to recompile their apps to get a version running ""in just a matter of days,"" said the company's software chief Craig Federighi. He added that old apps would automatically be translated at point of installation to run, although they would not work as well.To mark the significance of the move, MacOS will move to version 11. Since 2001, it had only moved from 10.0 to 10.15.Apple successfully made the switch from IBM-Motorola's PowerPC processors to Intel's x86 family in 2006.However, some software was never updated and cannot easily be run on today's Mac computers. Apple dropped support for running older software under emulation in the 2011 release of its Mac operating system.Microsoft already allows Windows 10 to be run on both Intel and ARM-based processors and looks set to continue supporting both chip architectures.Apple has not stated how long it will do the same. As a result, some people considering buying one of its laptop or desktop computers may decide to postpone a purchase until its first ARM-based computers go on sale.This could hit sales both at Apple and the development studios that make software for the platform.ARM-based chips are based on the designs of the UK-based company, which is headquartered in Cambridge. Other companies then adapt these to add capabilities of their own.Samsung, Qualcomm and Huawei are among the many other companies to do so.Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor, according to market research firm Gartner, coming behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell.The company has said that it has more than 100 million active Mac users. Back in June 2005, when it first announced the move to Intel chips, the figure was about 12.5 million.""Apple is approximately 4.5% of the laptop market and 2.6% of the desktop market, so the financial impact to Intel will not be significant,"" commented Gartner's Jon Erensen.""However, this transition... could give momentum to Microsoft's current efforts to run Windows on Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors."" Existing Mac owners will see changes to the next MacOS operating system - called Big Sur - which Apple said marked its biggest redesign to date. Analysis by James Clayton, North America technology reporterThe best way to describe a processor is the brain of the computer. Hardly surprising then that the processor in your computer is kind of important. Changing it is no small thing - and Apple hasn't decided this lightly.The big question though - and the one that if you're reading this you're probably more interested in - is what will this do for Macs in general?The prevailing view in Silicon Valley is moving to Apple silicon will make for more powerful Macs.Bringing it in-house could create cheaper processors - so in theory you could have cheaper Macs (that's if Apple wanted to pass on savings to the consumer). But there are risks too. The first is that Apple still has Intel-based Macs yet to come out. Will people simply wait for Apple's new processor to go live before choosing to buy a new computer? And - considering how well Mac products sell there will be a nervousness about changing a formula that has worked very well for Apple for the last 15 years. Other announcements at WWDC included the ability to use an iPhone as a substitute for a car key by transmitting an NFC (near-field communication) signal to unlock doors and start the engine.This will initially be limited to some new BMWs, but the firm said it intended to expand to other models in time.Sad to say I am not changing my car to use my iPhone as a key but I am sure #BMW customers are interested in this given #Samsung got a lot of traction with it #WWDC20 pic.twitter.com/JXsWcuajZmEnd of Twitter post  by @caro_milanesiApp developers will also have to provide more information about the data they gather about users, so that Apple can display a summary to them before they install the software.By surfacing apps wanting your location or to track you, Apple is educating consumers and heightening their awareness of the situation. Creates more interest and desire for their privacy stance.End of Twitter post  by @BenBajarinOne of the biggest changes to the iPhone's iOS14 operating system will be a shake-up of the home screen.Apps can now be automatically organised into folders containing:In addition, the firm is updating its ""widgets"" - blocks that display a stripped-down, small app window - so that they can be placed among the icons for other programs. Examples included weather forecasts, news briefings, and calendar meetings. Android already has something similar.Another Android-like new feature is the introduction of App Clips, which allow part of a program to be downloaded quickly. These must be less than 10 megabytes in size and will be able to be triggered via an NFC-transmission or by scanning a QR code. Suggested uses included the ability to order a drink in a cafe or to pay for a car-parking space.Apple is also releasing a new app called Translate that carries out language translations offline, offering an alternative to Google Translate.It will support 11 languages to begin with including English, Mandarin, French, German, and Arabic.#iOS14 leverages UI ideas from past #android releases, but only in a more elegant way @Apple #WWDCEnd of Twitter post  by @waynesworldFor the first time, users will be able to set third-party email and web browser apps as the default in iOS, rather than Apple's own software.The UK and Ireland will be among countries given access to an overhauled version of its Maps app, which provides more detailed views of roads and paths than before - as well as new cycling directions and routes for electric cars that pass charging stations.And its MeMoji cartoon-like characters now feature new styling options, including the addition of protective face masks.Apple's tablet operating system iPadOS will also benefit from several enhancements to its Pencil stylus.These include:The next version of WatchOS adds sleep-tracking functionality to the firm's smartwatch - which will be based on a user's movements in bed.It also adds the ability to determine when the owner is washing their hands, in order to confirm whether they have done so for long enough to help protect against Covid-19.It wouldn't surprise me if the new hand-washing app on Apple Watch and face mask Memojis emerges as some of the big stories of WWDC.

Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference often features new product announcements but is mainly an event for software developers working on Apple's platforms - some of whom are now voicing discontent about its pricing.The argument was ignited in part by an email app called Hey, created by developer David Heinemeier Hansson.

He pointed to email apps from Gmail and Microsoft's Outlook, which he says are treated differently, but which Apple would not discuss with him. Hey's annual subscription of $99 (¬£80) is available only directly from the company online, and the app does not tell users where to buy it - so the firm believed it was following all the rules, similar to other email apps.But Apple told him the app should never have been approved in the first place - and could be removed.""If we don't like the deal Apple is offering us - which is to either pay them 30% or get kicked out - what are we going to do about that?

Last of Us Part II: Is this the most accessible game ever?,"The first time Steve Saylor fired up the hotly-anticipated new game The Last of Us Part II, he burst into tears. ""Y'all don't even know how much..."" he says between sobs in his video of the moment, which has now had nearly half a million views.""I'm sorry. I don't even know what to say."" Steve is legally blind, and was looking at the overwhelming accessibility options menu.Courtney Craven, editor of accessibility-focused gaming site Can I Play That, is hard of hearing and has some motor-control issues, and had a similar reaction. ""The first thing I did upon launching [the game] for the first time was FaceTime a friend and cry,"" she says.The game has already been dubbed ""the most accessible game ever"". It has more than 60 different accessibility settings, allowing an unprecedented level of customisation and fine-tuning.Every button can be changed, and one-handed control schemes are available by default. Players like Courtney can turn on direction arrows on subtitles to indicate where the sound is coming from; players like Steve can outline characters and enemies in vivid colours.Steve, who goes by the name ""Blind Gamer"" online, has nystagmus - an involuntary eye movement that blurs his vision. Ever since he was a child playing the original Nintendo Entertainment System, he has had to sit extremely close to the screen, and his reflexes haven't always fitted into what modern games expect.""For the first time in my entire life, I was able to sit back on the couch and play the game without any barriers getting in the way."" he says. ""I was able to sit comfortably and play a game  just like if my friends were in the room playing with me. And that, to me, was extremely opening. It was emotional.""In the interest of honesty, Steve is keen to let people know that he did consult with the game's developer, Naughty Dog, when they were exploring accessibility issues.Courtney, meanwhile, suffers from being surprised by enemies that she is expected to hear, among other things.""So many games have directional audio with characters saying things like, 'over here!'"" she explains.""Hearing players can follow the direction of the voice but I'm often standing there like: 'Uhhh, where is here?'"" Game accessibility has come a long way in recent years, but gamers largely depend on individual developers to decide how much - or how few - accessibility options to include. In recent years, a willingness by major developers such as Ubisoft to incorporate accessibility into the early stages of big-budget game design has helped push the subject forward.In 2015, the Playstation 4 became the first major system to allow re-mapping of controller buttons at a system level, rather than relying on developers to include the option in their games. For many people with motor or dexterity impairments, that opened up the possibility of playing games that may previously have been unplayable.A watershed moment came in 2018, with the release of Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller - a customisable unit which allowed disabled gamers to use a wide range of assistive devices such as switches and bite pedals. But it only solves problems for those who have trouble using a standard controller. And big titles still come in for criticism from the community. Activision's Spyro Reignited Trilogy was criticised when it was released without subtitles in its cut-scenes - while CD Projekt Red had to release a patch for blockbuster game The Witcher 3 to enable players to adjust the font size.It is against that kind of backdrop that many are calling this latest success ""the most accessible game ever"".""We're going to look back on this and [see] everything for accessibility before The Last of Us Part II, and after,"" Steve says.Courtney, who founded Can I Play That in November 2018 to focus on gaming accessibility, says the effort is unprecedented.""A lot of games do some of these things. None of them have done all of them until now,"" she says. She hopes this game will be a blueprint for others to follow - and thinks there are rewards for developers who do.""I think the monetary payoff will really be obvious,"" she says. ""So many people have told me that Can I Play That's coverage of it was the deciding factor in them buying the game"".But more importantly, she urged people to ""make accessible games because you should. It's the right thing to do.""Steve puts it simply: ""It just makes their game that much better.""He points to friends without a diagnosed disability who told him their experience was made better by using some of the same options.And he believes that this is the beginning of a new wave of advancement to come in the next decade.""Obviously, the more accessible it can be the more that people can play, and that just means more dollars,"" he says, pointing to a vast untapped audience.""And as a developer, they want everyone to be able to play their game, so why not make it so that it's accessible to those players?""",21 June 2020,technology
Coronavirus: What went wrong with the UK's contact tracing app?,"After months of work, the UK has ditched the way its coronavirus-tracing app works, prompting a blame game between the government and two of the world's biggest tech firms. So what went wrong?At the end of March, I got a text from a senior figure in the UK's technology industry. This person said they were helping the NHS ""on a very substantial project that will launch in days and potentially save hundreds of thousands of British lives.""That was the first I knew of the plan to build a contact tracing app, a project that soon appeared to be at the very centre of the government's strategy to beat coronavirus and help us all emerge from lockdown. The tech luminary had somehow assumed that I could be an adviser to the project - I made it clear that could not be my role but I was very interested in following its progress.Now, nearly three months on, after missing deadline after deadline, there has been a radical change in direction. The app that has been developed so far is being scrapped, and a new approach will be tried based on a system created by Apple and Google. But there is no guarantee when, if ever, this will be rolled out. So what went wrong?When the team from the NHSX digital division was assembled they were told they were engaged on a vital mission. According to a presentation the team was shown the Covid-19 app would have four aims:Once installed on a user's phone, the app would use Bluetooth to keep a record of other people with whom they came into close contact - as long as they too had installed the app. Then when someone tested positive for the virus, alerts would be sent to their close contacts of recent days telling them to go into quarantine.The epidemiological expertise was provided by a team of Oxford scientists who had argued that there was an urgent need to  identify people who were spreading the virus without knowing. ""Very fast contact tracing was likely to be essential,"" says one of the Oxford team, Dr David Bonsall. ""And smartphones have the technological capability to speed up that process.""But using the Bluetooth connection on smartphones to detect contacts was untested technology. Still, the team was inspired by Singapore, which had released its Trace Together app using that system.

18 June
In a major U-turn&comma; the UK ditches its version and shifts to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google. The Apple-Google design is promoted as being more privacy-focused. However&comma; it means epidemiologists will have access to less data.But it soon became clear that using Bluetooth was tricky. Reports from Singapore suggested people were reluctant to download the app because it had to be kept open on the phone all the time, draining the battery.Then on 10 April came a surprising announcement from Google and Apple. The two tech giants - on whose software virtually all the world's smartphones depend - said they were going to develop a system that would help Bluetooth contact-tracing apps work smoothly. But there was a catch - only privacy-focused apps would be allowed to use the platform.Apple and Google favoured decentralised apps, where the matching between infected people and their list of contacts happened between their phones. The alternative was for the matching to be done on a central computer, owned by a health authority, which would end up storing lots of very sensitive information.The app the NHS was developing was based on a centralised model, which the Oxford scientists felt was vital if the health service was to be able to monitor virus outbreaks properly.Two days later, with quite a fanfare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock unveiled the plans for the Covid-19 app, promising ""all data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research"". But immediately privacy campaigners, politicians and technology experts raised concerns. ""I recognise the overwhelming force of the public health arguments for a centralised system, but I also have 25 years' experience of the NHS being incompetent at developing systems and repeatedly breaking their privacy promises,"" said Cambridge University's Prof Ross Anderson.Yet the project was still gathering pace with the first trial of the app at RAF Leeming, in Yorkshire. The trial was held under artificial conditions, with servicemen and women placing phones adjacent to each other on tables to see what happened.Meanwhile, privacy-conscious Germany became the latest country to switch its app to the decentralised model, using the Apple and Google system. It seemed that Apple had made it clear that it would not cooperate with a centralised app.Michael Veale, a British academic working with a consortium developing decentralised apps, warned that the NHS app was on the wrong path, asking on Twitter ""will the UK push ahead with an app that will not work on iPhones - which has devastated adoption in Singapore?""But the UK pushed ahead with a trial in the Isle of Wight. As it got underway Mr Hancock told the public they had a ""duty"" to download the app when it became available and that it would be crucial in getting ""our liberty back"" as the lockdown was eased.First sight of the app showed it was very simple, asking users whether they had a fever or a continuous cough. But any symptom alerts sent out to contacts merely echoed the standard ""stay alert"" advice - test results couldn't be entered into the app at this stage. It left many residents confused.Still, the fact that the app was quickly downloaded by more than half of the island's smartphone users saw the government branding the trial a success.Meanwhile, the Financial Times revealed that the government had hired a Swiss software developer to build a second app, using the Apple and Google technology. NHS insiders were quick to downplay the significance of this move - although one admitted ""Downing Street is getting nervous"".Work continued on a second, more sophisticated version of the original app, which was again going to be tested in the Isle of Wight before a national rollout - though the original deadline of mid-May had been missed.On 20 May, however, it became clear that the government's focus was switching to manual-contact tracing. The prime minister announced that a ""world beating"" tracing system would be in place by the beginning of June, though Number 10 stressed that the app's contribution to the system would come a bit later.As May drew to a close the boss of the wider test and trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, said the app would be the ""cherry on the cake"" of the project. It was no longer the cake itself.By early June, more deadlines for the national release of the app had come and gone. Three weeks into the Isle of Wight trial residents were getting restless, with very little information on how it was going or when an updated version of the app was coming.France launched its centralised Stop-Covid app, which had drawn heavy criticism from privacy campaigners, and digital minister Cedric O said 600,000 downloads in the first few hours was ""a good start"".On 4 June, Business Minister Nadhim Zadhawi was coaxed into saying the app should be ready by the end of the month, but that was the last firm deadline that would be promised.Singapore, which had continued to struggle to make its contact tracing app work, announced plans to give all citizens a wearable device in the hope that this would do a better job than a smartphone.On 14 June, Germany became the biggest country to launch a decentralised app on the Apple/Google platform. It quickly outstripped France in terms of downloads with something approaching 10% of the population installing it. By now the silence from the UK government about the NHS app was deafening. What was going on?Around lunchtime on 18 June all became clear. The BBC broke the story that the government was abandoning the centralised app and moving to something based on Google and Apple's technology. Despite all the spin, the Isle of Wight trial had highlighted a disastrous flaw in the app - it failed to detect 96% of contacts with Apple iPhones.The blame game has already begun. Mr Hancock and some of the scientists working with the NHS believe Apple should have been more cooperative. Technology experts and privacy campaigners say they warned months ago how this story would end.Apple says it did not know the UK was working on a ""hybrid"" version of the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app using tech it developed with Google.Meanwhile, there is scant proof from anywhere around the world that smartphone apps using Bluetooth are an effective method of contact tracing.

Katie Hopkins permanently suspended from Twitter,"Controversial commentator Katie Hopkins has been permanently suspended from Twitter for violating its hateful conduct policy, the social media giant said.Ms Hopkins, who had more than one million followers, was previously suspended in January for a week.But Twitter said her latest ban is permanent.The social network did not, however, say which tweets Ms Hopkins had posted, to result in the ban.""Keeping Twitter safe is a top priority for us - abuse and hateful conduct have no place on our service and we will continue to take action when our rules are broken,"" it said.The cited hateful conduct policy bans promotion of violence or direct written attacks and threats on other people, based on a wide range of personal characteristics such as race, gender or sexual orientation.Ms Hopkins is well-known for both her media appearances and controversial right-wing viewpoints.She has been re-tweeted by US President Donald Trump on several occasions.Twitter has recently taken a firmer line against Mr Trump himself over tweets it says break its policies.The US President has seen warnings placed on some of his tweets and others hidden from general view, although they remain online.But leaving such tweets up in the public interest is an exception Twitter makes for world leaders - other accounts like Ms Hopkins' risk being suspended when they break Twitter's rules.",19 June 2020,technology
Mixer: Microsoft abandons gaming app in Facebook deal,"Microsoft has decided to close its Mixer livestreaming service and is partnering with Facebook Gaming instead.Mixer made headlines last year when it signed a reportedly multi-million dollar exclusivity deal with Ninja, a big star on rival platform Twitch.But despite the investment, Microsoft says the platform will close in one month's time.Ninja and other major gamers will no longer be tied to exclusivity deals.Ninja had been signed to Mixer for less than a year.From 22 July, Mixer's website and app will redirect users to Facebook Gaming.As part of the deal, Microsoft will work to bring its xCloud games-streaming service to Facebook.""This seems quite ruthless, but Microsoft's strategy to reach more gamers is underpinned by its cloud business, not Mixer,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls from the consultancy Ampere Analysis.""Clearly Facebook has significant reach globally, to expose users to xCloud.""All games-streamers in Mixer's partner programme will be granted partner status on Facebook Gaming if they wish to move to the platform.""Ultimately, the success of partners and streamers on Mixer is dependent on our ability to scale the platform for them as quickly and broadly as possible,"" Mixer said in a statement.""It became clear that the time needed to grow our own livestreaming community to scale was out of measure with the vision and experiences that Microsoft and Xbox want to deliver for gamers now, so we've decided to close the operations side of Mixer and help the community transition to a new platform.""In a separate blog post, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said the transition deal was part of a wider agreement between Xbox and Facebook, with Xbox aiming to introduce gaming features that work on Facebook and Instagram in the future.I love my community and what we built together on Mixer.

Apple Mac computers make jump to its own chips,"Apple has confirmed it will transition its Mac laptop and desktop computers to its own ARM-based processors.The move means that Macs will run on the same type of chips as the firm's iPhones and iPads, rather than Intel's.Intel had faced problems manufacturing its own designs, leading it to issue a public apology to computer-makers.Apple's challenge will be to carry off the transition smoothly and convince third-party developers to update their apps accordingly.""We expect to ship our first Mac with Apple silicon by the end of the year,"" said chief executive Tim Cook, adding that it would likely be two years before its full product line had made the jump.The firm said the move would allow it to offer new features and improved performance as well as making it easier for developers to ""write and optimise software for the entire Apple ecosystem"".The announcement was made at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).""Apple's motivations for doing this include reducing its dependence on Intel, maximizing its silicon investment, boosting performance and giving itself more flexibility and agility when it comes to future products,"" commented Geoff Blaber from the consultancy CCS Insight.""Embracing ARM and making its hardware more consistent across the iPhone, iPad and Mac ranges is a strategic necessity, but there will be inevitable bumps along the road.""Apple said it had already developed native versions of several of its own apps, including Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro.  iPhone and iPad apps will also be able to be run on the computers.Apple said that Microsoft was working on an optimised version of Office, and Adobe was developing a version of Photoshop.Other developers should be able to recompile their apps to get a version running ""in just a matter of days,"" said the company's software chief Craig Federighi. He added that old apps would automatically be translated at point of installation to run, although they would not work as well.To mark the significance of the move, MacOS will move to version 11. Since 2001, it had only moved from 10.0 to 10.15.Apple successfully made the switch from IBM-Motorola's PowerPC processors to Intel's x86 family in 2006.However, some software was never updated and cannot easily be run on today's Mac computers. Apple dropped support for running older software under emulation in the 2011 release of its Mac operating system.Microsoft already allows Windows 10 to be run on both Intel and ARM-based processors and looks set to continue supporting both chip architectures.Apple has not stated how long it will do the same. As a result, some people considering buying one of its laptop or desktop computers may decide to postpone a purchase until its first ARM-based computers go on sale.This could hit sales both at Apple and the development studios that make software for the platform.ARM-based chips are based on the designs of the UK-based company, which is headquartered in Cambridge. Other companies then adapt these to add capabilities of their own.Samsung, Qualcomm and Huawei are among the many other companies to do so.Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor, according to market research firm Gartner, coming behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell.The company has said that it has more than 100 million active Mac users. Back in June 2005, when it first announced the move to Intel chips, the figure was about 12.5 million.""Apple is approximately 4.5% of the laptop market and 2.6% of the desktop market, so the financial impact to Intel will not be significant,"" commented Gartner's Jon Erensen.""However, this transition... could give momentum to Microsoft's current efforts to run Windows on Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors."" Existing Mac owners will see changes to the next MacOS operating system - called Big Sur - which Apple said marked its biggest redesign to date. Analysis by James Clayton, North America technology reporterThe best way to describe a processor is the brain of the computer. Hardly surprising then that the processor in your computer is kind of important. Changing it is no small thing - and Apple hasn't decided this lightly.The big question though - and the one that if you're reading this you're probably more interested in - is what will this do for Macs in general?The prevailing view in Silicon Valley is moving to Apple silicon will make for more powerful Macs.Bringing it in-house could create cheaper processors - so in theory you could have cheaper Macs (that's if Apple wanted to pass on savings to the consumer). But there are risks too. The first is that Apple still has Intel-based Macs yet to come out. Will people simply wait for Apple's new processor to go live before choosing to buy a new computer? And - considering how well Mac products sell there will be a nervousness about changing a formula that has worked very well for Apple for the last 15 years. Other announcements at WWDC included the ability to use an iPhone as a substitute for a car key by transmitting an NFC (near-field communication) signal to unlock doors and start the engine.This will initially be limited to some new BMWs, but the firm said it intended to expand to other models in time.Sad to say I am not changing my car to use my iPhone as a key but I am sure #BMW customers are interested in this given #Samsung got a lot of traction with it #WWDC20 pic.twitter.com/JXsWcuajZmEnd of Twitter post  by @caro_milanesiApp developers will also have to provide more information about the data they gather about users, so that Apple can display a summary to them before they install the software.By surfacing apps wanting your location or to track you, Apple is educating consumers and heightening their awareness of the situation. Creates more interest and desire for their privacy stance.End of Twitter post  by @BenBajarinOne of the biggest changes to the iPhone's iOS14 operating system will be a shake-up of the home screen.Apps can now be automatically organised into folders containing:In addition, the firm is updating its ""widgets"" - blocks that display a stripped-down, small app window - so that they can be placed among the icons for other programs. Examples included weather forecasts, news briefings, and calendar meetings. Android already has something similar.Another Android-like new feature is the introduction of App Clips, which allow part of a program to be downloaded quickly. These must be less than 10 megabytes in size and will be able to be triggered via an NFC-transmission or by scanning a QR code. Suggested uses included the ability to order a drink in a cafe or to pay for a car-parking space.Apple is also releasing a new app called Translate that carries out language translations offline, offering an alternative to Google Translate.It will support 11 languages to begin with including English, Mandarin, French, German, and Arabic.#iOS14 leverages UI ideas from past #android releases, but only in a more elegant way @Apple #WWDCEnd of Twitter post  by @waynesworldFor the first time, users will be able to set third-party email and web browser apps as the default in iOS, rather than Apple's own software.The UK and Ireland will be among countries given access to an overhauled version of its Maps app, which provides more detailed views of roads and paths than before - as well as new cycling directions and routes for electric cars that pass charging stations.And its MeMoji cartoon-like characters now feature new styling options, including the addition of protective face masks.Apple's tablet operating system iPadOS will also benefit from several enhancements to its Pencil stylus.These include:The next version of WatchOS adds sleep-tracking functionality to the firm's smartwatch - which will be based on a user's movements in bed.It also adds the ability to determine when the owner is washing their hands, in order to confirm whether they have done so for long enough to help protect against Covid-19.It wouldn't surprise me if the new hand-washing app on Apple Watch and face mask Memojis emerges as some of the big stories of WWDC.

The North Face and Patagonia boycott Facebook ads,"Outdoor brands The North Face, Patagonia and Rei have pulled their advertising from Facebook platforms.The Stop Hate For Profits campaign is calling on brands to join the boycott during the month of July.The North Face said it was halting ads ""until stricter policies are put in place to stop racist, violent or hateful content and misinformation from circulating on the platform.""Facebook said it was committed to ""advancing equity and racial justice"". ""We're taking steps to review our policies, ensure diversity and transparency when making decisions on how we apply our policies, and advance racial justice and voter engagement on our platform,"" it said in a long post, published on Sunday.Patagonia said it would also be joining the boycott until ""at least the end of July"". Patagonia is proud to join the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. We will pull all ads on Facebook and Instagram, effective immediately, through at least the end of July, pending meaningful action from the social media giant.End of Twitter post  by @patagoniaA spokesman for VF Corp, which owns The North Face, told CNN it was considering adding other brands in its portfolio to the boycott - it also owns Timberland and Vans.Facebook has faced heavy criticism, including from its own staff, for chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's decision not to remove a controversial post by US President Donald Trump.The same message was also shared on Twitter, where it was hidden behind a warning label on the grounds that it ""glorified violence"".Joseph Evans, head of tech at Enders Analysis, said Facebook was trying to both avoid further regulation from the US government, and maintain ad revenue. ""Facebook can weather a boycott by large companies better than any other media organisation out there, as so much of its revenue comes from smaller advertisers who are unlikely to band together to make political demands,"" he said. ""However, right now, lots of those small advertisers are under pressure due to Covid-19 drying up their cashflow. So we could be seeing a perfect storm.""What I expect to see is Facebook trying to walk a tightrope: interpreting its existing guidelines slightly more strictly, erring more on the side of taking down hate speech, but without much in the way of explicit policy changes that could provoke punitive regulations or get Mark Zuckerberg dragged before another Senate Committee.""",22 June 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Ireland set to launch contact-trace app,"Ireland's health authority plans to press ahead with the launch of a coronavirus contact-tracing app based on Apple and Google's technology.The Health Service Executive told the BBC that it would submit a memo to government this week, and ""subject to approval"" would launch its Covid Tracker app shortly after.The move comes despite concerns raised about the tech's accuracy in its current state. The UK is worried about false alerts.And researchers advising the Irish effort have also questioned whether the software should be rolled out in its current state.Ireland would follow Germany in deploying such an app nationwide.Two tests were carried out in Ireland ahead of the launch of its app.Members of the An Garda Siochana police force volunteered to take part in field trials at the start of the month to see how it would perform in everyday situations.""The Gardai are one of the few groups of people that are moving around and interacting with each other as they carry out their duties,"" explained a spokeswoman for the country's government.The results have given health chiefs confidence to roll it out to the public.And they note that because it has been designed to support UK mobile numbers, visitors crossing the border from Northern Ireland or travelling across from Great Britain can also make use if it.The second experiment involved a team at Trinity College, Dublin testing an app based on the Google-Apple API [application programming interface] on a commuter bus.It found that metal in the vehicle's structure and fittings caused problems.The Google-API allows the threshold for what triggers a contact match to be adjusted based on the strength of the Bluetooth signal and duration of the exposure.When using the settings already in use by Switzerland's contact-tracing app, the researchers found that no contact logs were logged despite 60 pairs of handsets being placed within 2m of each other.And they only managed to raise this to an 8% detection rate when they shortened the exposure time and adjusted the Bluetooth strength to a level that they said would be likely to cause false alerts in other environments.In addition, the researchers said signal strength was sometimes higher for phones that were far apart than those close together, which they said made reliable proximity-detection ""hard or perhaps even impossible"" to achieve.""As to whether it is sensible to deploy these apps, I'd say the jury is still out on that,"" Prof Doug Leith told the BBC.""But the likely effectiveness of apps based on the Apple-Google API in real-world situations  -ie outside the lab - is certainly far from clear."" Last week, the UK ditched its own contact-tracing technology to switch to the Apple-Google model.But while the government now intends to launch a Covid-19 app of some sort in England by the Autumn, it has said it may still not include contact-tracing functionality.""I was only prepared to recommend to people that they download an app when I'm really confident in it,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.Apple and Google are under pressure to become less restrictive about the data they share to let apps become more accurate.""The API does not expose Bluetooth received signal strength (RSS) measurements directly, rather it abstracts this,"" explained Dr Brendan Jennings, who is also involved in developing Ireland's app.""There certainly are some changes in the API that we believe would be helpful - and we do believe that Google/Apple will be willing to take on board suggested changes in future revisions.""But in the meantime, others have already decided to launch apps based on the two US tech firms' software tool, including:One of the developers of Germany's app said it was currently 80% accurate at logging matches across a range of scenarios, and it had been felt that this was good enough to go with.""There can be false alerts,"" added SAP's Thomas Leonhardi.""But that can also happen via manual contact tracing. It's the best we have and of course we're still working on it.""The Robert Koch Institute, which published the Corona-Warn App on behalf of the German government, said on Friday morning that it had already been downloaded 9.6 million times. The country's population is about 83 million.Once Ireland has got an app based on the Apple/Google toolkit up and running then Northern Ireland and indeed the rest of the UK should be able to use it - job done, right?Well, no, say insiders on the NHS team. First, an app is more than just the code - you would need to integrate it with the public health advice, the testing infrastructure and the manual contact-tracing systems for each of the four home nations. But the key issue is the question of whether the Apple/Google system is actually working well at measuring the distance between two phones using Bluetooth - last Thursday Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Test and Trace supremo Baroness Dido Harding made it clear they thought it wasn't.Incidentally, Baroness Harding may have overstated the failings of the centralised app in the Isle of Wight during Thursday's briefings when she said it could only detect 4% of iPhone contacts.Someone on the island who was briefed about what went wrong tells me that this disastrous 4% only referred to cases where the app was asleep in the background after a long period when two iPhones had not been in use for a while - which apparently accounts for just a small percentage of overall iPhone contacts.What's frustrated both the app team and Apple is that in the days before the U-turn, the two sides had apparently begun working closely on ways to make Bluetooth work better with the app in the background. Thursday's announcement came as a surprise to the developers and to the tech giant - which was then dismayed to hear Mr Hancock accusing it of a failure to co-operate.",22 June 2020,technology
