Disney's head of streaming to become CEO of TikTok,"Disney's head of streaming Kevin Mayer is stepping down to become the boss of social media platform TikTok.He has been named the chief executive officer of TikTok and chief operating officer of ByteDance, the platform's Chinese parent company.TikTok, an app where users post short videos, has seen an explosion of growth since its US launch.But that increased popularity has led to scrutiny by the US government over its ties to China.Mr Mayer will be responsible for ByteDance's ""global development"" including emerging business, gaming and music.""I'm excited to help lead the next phase of ByteDance's journey as the company continues to expand its breadth of products across every region of the world,"" Mr Mayer said in the release.He will be the first CEO of TikTok. TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times on iOS and Android since it was launched globally in 2017.  The app allows users to make videos up to 15-seconds long with music in the background.The coronavirus pandemic has helped boost its popularity further with many users making comical or musical videos of their quarantine experiences.But having a Chinese parent company has worried US politicians. Some of them have raised concerns about ByteDance allowing Chinese government censorship or data collection on TikTok users. Both are charges ByteDance denies.At Disney, Mr Mayer oversaw the successful launch of the firms streaming service, Disney Plus in November of 2019. The service had over 54 million subscribers by May. He also managed the firms other streaming investments including Hulu, Hotstar, and sports streaming services ESPN plus.He was also considered a key figure in the company's acquisitions of Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel.  Before Disney's former chief executive Bob Iger stepped down from that role in February, Mr Mayer was viewed as a possible candidate to replace him. However, the role was given to Bob Chapek, head of parks, experiences and products.Mr Mayer will be joining ByteDance on 1 June.  ",19 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Isle of Wight contact-tracing app trial - a mixed verdict so far,"It is 10 days since all Isle of Wight residents were invited to test the NHS app at the heart of the government's test, track and trace strategy. So how's it going? Mixed would probably be a fair verdict.The big concern was how many people would download it. Epidemiologists suggest that for the UK as a whole, about 60% of the population needs to install and use the software for it to live up to its full potential.So when Downing Street says there have been roughly 60,000 downloads, that's not a bad result. The island's population is 140,000, and its inhabitants are slightly older and less likely to own a smartphone than the UK average.But one cautionary note - that 60,000 may include some who downloaded it twice or are from the mainland.Still that compares well with other experiments. About 20% of the population of Singapore downloaded its contact-tracing app, and last week an Australian government app had been installed by roughly a quarter of its population.But here's the key question - does it work? Are users being alerted to take action after coming into contact with the virus? Here, there is very little to go on. What we know is that there are just 173 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on the Isle of Wight. With most people still in lockdown, it is quite unlikely that any single individual using the app would have come into contact with an infected person.Then there is the fact that what's been offered is an early, unsophisticated version of the app. At this stage, it only asks someone who feels unwell about two symptoms - a high temperature and a continuous cough. Depending on their answers, they may then be directed to a call centre to order a medical test. People with whom they recently came into proximity may be sent alerts, warning them they need to be ""super careful"", as one of the app team put it to me, and be on the lookout for their own symptoms.But here's the problem. As it stands, the app does not allow them to enter a test result, positive or negative. That means their contacts are effectively left in limbo. Health chiefs had previously suggested that contacts would be given the all-clear or potentially be told to self-isolate depending on whether the original user was determined to have the virus - but the app doesn't do that yet.One GP on the island told the BBC: ""My concern when the public realise this, is they will feel 'what's in it for me' and be disincentivised. The truth is very little is in it for them other than the greater good.""His other concern was that if it's marginally easier to obtain a test via the app, people might be tempted to lie about their symptoms to get one, triggering pointless notifications as a consequence.The NHS and its software developers are now working on an updated version of the app, which addresses some of those issues. It will probably have four questions rather than two, and feature a wider range of symptoms including the loss of sense of taste or smell. The algorithm is being tweaked so the answers could either trigger a stronger warning to previous contacts or none at all, pending the results of tests. And the whole testing process should be integrated into the app more effectively, meaning the process of sending people either a red alert or an all-clear becomes much smoother. That, at least, is the theory. But will it work in practice?The NHS has previously indicated it would go straight from the Isle of Wight trial to a national rollout. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had said the app would be deployed across England in mid-May, but was much vaguer about the timing in the House of Commons this afternoon.Downing Street would only commit to saying it aims ""to roll out the app across the country in the coming weeks"".It seems the islanders will first be asked to test version two before the rest of us join this great experiment.",18 May 2020,technology
Rainbow Six 'copy' lands Apple and Google in copyright court,"Ubisoft is suing Apple and Google over a Chinese mobile game it says is ""a near carbon copy"" of one of its most popular games, Rainbow Six: Siege.Area F2 is ""designed to closely replicate... virtually every aspect"" of the game, it alleges, in a 43-page document, complete with screenshots.It is also suing the developer, Ejoy, owned by Chinese tech giant Alibaba. Characters, game modes, game maps, animations, and even the user interface were copied, the document alleges.""Virtually every aspect of AF2 is copied from R6S, from the operator selection screen to the final scoring screen and everything in between,"" Ubisoft claims.""In fact, the games are so similar that an ordinary observer viewing and playing both games likely would be unable to differentiate between them."" Ubisoft estimates Area F2 has been downloaded more than a million times and made ""tens of thousands of dollars"" on in-game purchases.It says it has raised the issue with both Apple and Google, which both take a cut of sales on their respective app stores.""But rather than take any measures to stop or curtail the infringementâ€¦ Google and Apple instead decided that it would be more profitable to collect their revenue share from AF2 and continue their unlawful distribution,"" Ubisoft says in its court filing.Its submissions to the court also say Rainbow Six: Siege, released in 2015, is ""among Ubisoft's most valuable game properties"", with three million players every day.The game franchise is based on a Tom Clancy novel of the same name.Ubisoft is seeking a jury trial over the alleged copyright infringement, in the Central District Court of California.Apple declined to comment on the case. Google and the app developer did not immediately return requests for comment.",18 May 2020,technology
Europe's supercomputers hijacked by attackers for crypto mining,"At least a dozen supercomputers across Europe have shut down after cyber-attacks tried to take control of them.A pan-European supercomputing group says they seem to have tried to use the machines to mine cryptocurrency.""A security exploitation"" disabled access to the Archer supercomputer, at the University of Edinburgh, on 11 May.Staff said they were working with the National Cyber Security Centre to restore the system, which had recently installed a pandemic modelling tool. ""We now believe this to be a major issue across the academic community as several computers have been compromised in the UK and elsewhere in Europe,"" the team said.The NCSC said: ""We are aware of this incident and are providing support. ""The NCSC works with the academic sector to help it improve its security practices and protect its institutions from threats.""Also on 11 May, another attack shut down five supercomputers in Germany.Others followed elsewhere in Germany in the following days, as well as in Switzerland, and reportedly Barcelona.They exploited an Secure Shell (SSH) connection, which academic researchers use to log in to the system remotely.And once inside, the attackers appear to have deployed cryptocurrency-mining malware.The security team at the European Group Infrastructure foundation said: ""A malicious group is currently targeting academic data centres for CPU [central processing unit] mining purposes. ""The attacker is hopping from one victim to another using compromised SSH credentials."" Jamie Akhtar, chief executive of UK security company Cybersmart, said: ""Universities are home to some of the most advanced research projects in the world across many disciplines - including computer science - but they are also notoriously vulnerable to attack if they are connected to the wider university network.""",18 May 2020,technology

The tech industry's winners and losers in lockdown,"The coronavirus pandemic has been bad news for business. But even as some technology companies have been squeezed tight, others have actually seen a boost.Some were in the right place at the right time - while others have seen the real-world trade they rely on shut down completely.When your boss told you to start working from home, you might have had to rush to get to grips with the new kit to do so.Entire populations did - which is good news for those making the software.Despite some major PR disasters around privacy and security issues, Zoom's stock price more than doubled since December.And its user numbers have exploded from 10 million a day to 200 million. Once a relatively unknown business app, it's been used for everything from cabinet meetings to farm-animal cameos.It's not alone. In March, Microsoft Teams said it had hit 44 million users, a jump of 40% in the space of a week. Remote-access software Teamviewer has seen ""significant extra demand"".And the chief executive of popular work-chat app Slack reported setting repeated all-time user records day after day at the end of March.When we've finished the work day, we're still staying at home.And Gaming is doing well while people are stuck indoors and in need of an escape. Literally, in the case of Animal Crossing, on the Nintendo Switch - it puts the player on a deserted island getaway, building a colourful town populated by talking animals. Players have loved designing new homes and it's now Nintendo's biggest game launch on the console.Online games are also seeing a big boost in numbers, with the newly launched Call of Duty game rocketing to tens of millions of players. Analysts estimate game sales are up about 35% year on year.And hardware is up 63%, meaning consoles are frequently out of stock.Over 60 million #Warzone players.

Disney's head of streaming to become CEO of TikTok,"Disney's head of streaming Kevin Mayer is stepping down to become the boss of social media platform TikTok.He has been named the chief executive officer of TikTok and chief operating officer of ByteDance, the platform's Chinese parent company.TikTok, an app where users post short videos, has seen an explosion of growth since its US launch.But that increased popularity has led to scrutiny by the US government over its ties to China.Mr Mayer will be responsible for ByteDance's ""global development"" including emerging business, gaming and music.""I'm excited to help lead the next phase of ByteDance's journey as the company continues to expand its breadth of products across every region of the world,"" Mr Mayer said in the release.He will be the first CEO of TikTok. TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times on iOS and Android since it was launched globally in 2017.  The app allows users to make videos up to 15-seconds long with music in the background.The coronavirus pandemic has helped boost its popularity further with many users making comical or musical videos of their quarantine experiences.But having a Chinese parent company has worried US politicians. Some of them have raised concerns about ByteDance allowing Chinese government censorship or data collection on TikTok users. Both are charges ByteDance denies.At Disney, Mr Mayer oversaw the successful launch of the firms streaming service, Disney Plus in November of 2019. The service had over 54 million subscribers by May. He also managed the firms other streaming investments including Hulu, Hotstar, and sports streaming services ESPN plus.He was also considered a key figure in the company's acquisitions of Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel.

Coronavirus: Isle of Wight contact-tracing app trial - a mixed verdict so far,"It is 10 days since all Isle of Wight residents were invited to test the NHS app at the heart of the government's test, track and trace strategy. So how's it going? Mixed would probably be a fair verdict.The big concern was how many people would download it. Epidemiologists suggest that for the UK as a whole, about 60% of the population needs to install and use the software for it to live up to its full potential.So when Downing Street says there have been roughly 60,000 downloads, that's not a bad result. The island's population is 140,000, and its inhabitants are slightly older and less likely to own a smartphone than the UK average.But one cautionary note - that 60,000 may include some who downloaded it twice or are from the mainland.Still that compares well with other experiments. About 20% of the population of Singapore downloaded its contact-tracing app, and last week an Australian government app had been installed by roughly a quarter of its population.But here's the key question - does it work? Are users being alerted to take action after coming into contact with the virus? Here, there is very little to go on. What we know is that there are just 173 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on the Isle of Wight. With most people still in lockdown, it is quite unlikely that any single individual using the app would have come into contact with an infected person.Then there is the fact that what's been offered is an early, unsophisticated version of the app. At this stage, it only asks someone who feels unwell about two symptoms - a high temperature and a continuous cough. Depending on their answers, they may then be directed to a call centre to order a medical test. People with whom they recently came into proximity may be sent alerts, warning them they need to be ""super careful"", as one of the app team put it to me, and be on the lookout for their own symptoms.But here's the problem. As it stands, the app does not allow them to enter a test result, positive or negative. That means their contacts are effectively left in limbo. Health chiefs had previously suggested that contacts would be given the all-clear or potentially be told to self-isolate depending on whether the original user was determined to have the virus - but the app doesn't do that yet.One GP on the island told the BBC: ""My concern when the public realise this, is they will feel 'what's in it for me' and be disincentivised. The truth is very little is in it for them other than the greater good.""His other concern was that if it's marginally easier to obtain a test via the app, people might be tempted to lie about their symptoms to get one, triggering pointless notifications as a consequence.The NHS and its software developers are now working on an updated version of the app, which addresses some of those issues. It will probably have four questions rather than two, and feature a wider range of symptoms including the loss of sense of taste or smell. The algorithm is being tweaked so the answers could either trigger a stronger warning to previous contacts or none at all, pending the results of tests. And the whole testing process should be integrated into the app more effectively, meaning the process of sending people either a red alert or an all-clear becomes much smoother. That, at least, is the theory. But will it work in practice?The NHS has previously indicated it would go straight from the Isle of Wight trial to a national rollout. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had said the app would be deployed across England in mid-May, but was much vaguer about the timing in the House of Commons this afternoon.Downing Street would only commit to saying it aims ""to roll out the app across the country in the coming weeks"".It seems the islanders will first be asked to test version two before the rest of us join this great experiment.",18 May 2020,technology

Universities' move online 'must be done the right way',"Harry Ashworth should be in the final term of his first year at Oxford University, studying music. Instead he is stuck at his parents' house in south London hunched over a laptop, listening to lectures via Zoom.He doesn't feel that the sudden and dramatic change in circumstances has affected his learning too much, but he is missing some aspects of university life.""I am in a jazz orchestra and that isn't really happening now. And I would have been playing at the summer balls, so there are social events that I've missed.""Some of his more practical lessons have also been curtailed.Academically he feels less motivated ""which makes me less stressed but also flatter"".""Psychologically when you are at home it is different. When I am in my tutor's office I feel a bit more inspired.""Along with students around the world, Harry is getting used to the realities of online learning as part of the global lockdowns in response to the coronavirus pandemic.The fact that institutions have shifted to a digital model in a matter of weeks is impressive, thinks Kathryn Skelton, chief transformation officer at FutureLearn, an online learning platform owned by the Open University.Universities have ""moved Heaven and Earth"" to get to where they are now but still she says that ""her heart sinks"" when people think that delivering lectures via Zoom is enough.""Educators need to take a step back and ask not 'how can I replicate what I do in the classroom', but 'how can I redesign this learning experience to take advantage of a whole wealth of technology that can deliver a full learning experience - not just the delivery of information?'""Her tips include:Shai Reshef, president of online-only University of the People (UofPeople) agrees.""Lots of universities have shut down and asked professors to move lectures online and I think that many more universities should actually go in this direction, but they need to do it the right way. Don't have professors speaking for two hours. Adopt the entire pedagogy of online learning.""At UofPeople that involves daily small classes with a lot of interaction between students.Students who are refugees, or others who could never afford a traditional university education, are set weekly homework and assignment tasks. The eight-week modular courses are tuition-free and students pay only to sit the end-of-course exams. A year's worth of tuition costs $1,000 (Â£824).UofPeople has seen a huge rise in numbers, with 7,000 new students coming online for the new term.""A lot are coming to us because of the pandemic. We have students in quarantine who feel the best way to spend their time is going back to school. We have students whose schools have shut down, and they come to us to continue their studies, and they may go back to their schools when they reopen.""And we have a lot of people who have been laid off and realise that in order to get another job they need to study to change career.""FutureLearn has also seen demand for online courses rise more than threefold. Like UofPeople there is interest in learning new business skills. It has also seen a rise in interest in English language courses, mental health awareness such as mindfulness, and even courses designed to increase people's knowledge of coronavirus.If there is a silver lining to this crisis it is that more people will try out online learning, thinks Ms Skelton.""That traditional model of 18-to-21 year-olds who go to university, live in halls, is simply not feasible for a lot of people - those with caring responsibilities or those with financial restraints.""Once the pandemic is over, Mr Reshef thinks universities should consider a hybrid of online and traditional education, with the first year spent learning online and the next two in school.""It is not clear that universities will be open next year, and even if they are open they will have to have social distancing measures. Online is there and can continue to function seamlessly,"" he said.Online learning has had a mixed history. So-called Moocs (massive open online courses) were seen as revolutionary when they were first introduced, but retention rates are low. According to a study by MIT, the courses had a dropout rate of about 96% on average over five years.For students hoping to begin a traditional university journey in the autumn, there is still a great deal of uncertainty.Manchester University has already decided to deliver the bulk of its learning online in the autumn term, and similar discussions are going on in universities around the UK and beyond.  But for some courses, such as medicine, online-only will be tricky.Holly Leedham has just turned 18, and was looking forward to starting a new chapter of life at Liverpool University in the autumn, studying law with accounting. Now that has been thrown into doubt.""I would be really disappointed as the experience of making friends wouldn't be there. I think us having to pay full tuition fees and being at home isn't fair either, and I'd hope that would be reduced somehow.""But she said joining the university - even if it was online  - would be better than deferring.""I may as well be at uni while the world recovers from what I imagine to be a frightening recession.""Ellie Yeomans, who had hoped to study Sports Management at Nottingham Trent University, is similarly pragmatic.""I am assuming that the first term may be online and that would be gutting for everyone, but I think everyone just has to get on with it.""",17 May 2020,technology
Disney forces explicit Club Penguin clones offline,"Disney has ordered unauthorised copies of its Club Penguin game to close, after the BBC found children were being exposed to explicit messages. Visits to fan-run Club Penguin Online surged during the coronavirus pandemic with more than a million new players. But racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and sexual messages flow freely on the unauthorised platform.Disney said it was ""appalled"" by the website, and has ordered it to close or face legal action.Club Penguin Online appeared to go offline on Friday afternoon.One man involved in the site has been arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children.Detectives say the man from London has been released on bail pending further inquiries.Disney's Club Penguin was one of the first social networks for children. Launched in 2005, it had more than 200 million players at its peak.While anybody could join the original website, content filters and human moderators were employed to stop inappropriate messages or personal information from being shared.But Disney closed the website in 2017. Since then, unofficial clones of the website have been operated by fans. These private servers were launched using stolen or copied source code, and can easily be found by children searching the internet. Club Penguin Online is the largest of the social network's unofficial and unauthorised clones. It says its popularity has exploded during the coronavirus pandemic and now has seven million registered players.The BBC set up an account on the English, Spanish and Portuguese versions of Club Penguin Online. It found:Disney's original game banned the sharing of personal details, but players on this cloned site are openly sharing Snapchat, Instagram and Discord account details. A Zoom ""meet-up"" was also advertised and codes and passwords shared openly. Although it is impossible to verify the age of users, many told the BBC they were teenagers, and there were children playing, too.Kaden, 14, told the BBC there were areas of the game where it was safe to operate - but most players were in the unprotected ""mature"" sections. He said the conversations he had seen made him extremely uncomfortable.""Any kid can click on these mature sections and they just see all this inappropriate stuff,"" he said.""I've seen people advertise strip club igloos, I've seen people ask for pimps. There's a lot of swearing on there and I've been asked a lot of crazy things. It's really put me off going on these mature servers.""Kaden's dad, Rick, told the BBC he had no idea what was happening in the game. ""I'm shocked. I thought that if he's on Club Penguin, then he's in a pretty safe place.""Another long-time Club Penguin fan, teenager Miranda, said the game had ""gone from being family-friendly and fun to being monstrous"".Club Penguin Online is the largest private server and uses Disney's branding.One former staff member told the BBC the project had made about Â£9,000 through adverts, while most of the staff were young unpaid volunteers.Competition between Club Penguin Online and other unofficial versions of the game had escalated in the past six months. Server owners accused one another of hacking and harassment. One said it was a toxic community, ""like Game of Thrones with penguins"".The Club Penguin Online volunteer claims he was encouraged to carry out attacks on rival servers when he was a minor.""I would find out and publish [users'] personal details, like addresses, what they looked like, their family's information. I carried out DDoS (distributed denial of service attacks) on other users, and I would threaten people. The stuff that I did was similar to what happened to me, which affected my whole family, but I do feel really bad about it now.""A current Club Penguin Online staff member denied that this sort of activity was encouraged.Some gamers think the toxic culture on some of these fan servers is a wider problem that needs addressing.Gaming YouTuber Simi Adeshina, known online as Tamago2474, said: ""These private server games are being run by people who aren't really in a position or qualified to do so. It's all good and well to have a community that you've built, but when you get to a certain size there's a point where you have to have to employ a degree of professionalism.""Disney has issued copyright notices to all private server games, giving them a deadline to close down or face legal action.In statement, it said said: ""Child safety is a top priority for the Walt Disney Company and we are appalled by the allegations of criminal activity and abhorrent behaviour on this unauthorised website that is illegally using the Club Penguin brand and characters for its own purposes. ""We continue to enforce our rights against this, and other, unauthorised uses of the Club Penguin game.""",15 May 2020,technology
Glastonbury 5G report 'hijacked by conspiracy theorists',"Last month, the town council of Glastonbury in Somerset published a report calling for a government inquiry into the safety of 5G.It promised to oppose the rollout of the next-generation mobile networks in the town. Now, three members of the group that produced the report have told the BBC they resigned because it was taken over by anti-5G activists and ""spiritual healers"".They fear it could lend credibility to conspiracy theories, such as 5G being linked to the spread of coronavirus.""The whole thing was completely biased from the beginning,"" says Mark Swann, one of those who resigned. ""Genuine scientific expertise has been scorned in favour of conspiracy and hearsay,"" wrote David Swain in his letter of resignation. 5G is the next generation of mobile phone technology. It promises faster downloads and increased capacity.The radio waves involved in 5G  - and the previous generation networks - sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not energetic enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum, which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays.Get the facts: BBC Reality CheckThe report, published after a six-month inquiry, said the council would oppose the rollout of 5G, while accepting it had no power to halt it.Glastonbury's 5G Advisory Committee was made up of nine councillors, and nine local residents who responded to adverts calling for people with relevant experience to help decide whether 5G was safe.Among the volunteers were:All four ended up resigning before the report was completed.""I joined the working group in good faith, expecting to take part in a sensible discussion about 5G,"" says Mr Swann. ""Sadly the whole thing turned out to be a clueless pantomime driven by conspiracy theorists and sceptics."" Mr Cooper reached the same conclusion: ""I worked out there were only four of us who were neutral. And the others were all absolutely against 5G, either strongly or weakly.""Most of the evidence the committee heard was from witnesses who had stated their support for a moratorium on the rollout of 5G. They included retired American professor Martin Pall, who in 2019 claimed that wireless networks would make all human beings sterile if they were not switched off within two years. Another witness was Dr Andrew Tresidder, a former GP whose website offers flower remedies and emotional healing. His presentation focused on people claiming to suffer from ""electromagnetic stress"", which he said was often not taken seriously by mainstream doctors.Committee member Roy Procter, a spiritual healer who claims dowsing can heal ""sick houses"", also gave a presentation. In the report, he speculates about a link between the coronavirus and 5G, and recommends that the council eliminate all wi-fi connections.The committee's chairman, Councillor Jon Cousins, told the BBC he strongly disagrees with the suggestion that the meetings were biased towards pseudo-science. ""Equal weight was given to all contributions,"" he says, adding that councillors ""were able to take into account the prejudice, predetermination and bias displayed on all sides of the argument"".In the report, Mr Cousins said Glastonbury had punched above its weight, and other councils had been in touch about its recommendations.But both Mr Swann and Mr Cooper were particularly concerned about the role of an external member of the committee. Christopher Baker was instrumental in choosing witnesses to appear before the committee. He also gave his own presentation in which he attacked the credibility of ICNIRP, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, the body which sets the safety standards for mobile network emissions.Mr Baker has campaigned against 5G across the south-west. Before the committee was formed, he had been lobbying Glastonbury councillors to ban the technology. In a Facebook post in May 2019, he outlined his campaigning activities and bemoaned the lack of support from residents.""The only thing that is missing is the support from the community! I can't do this for you on my own, this is about you and for you,"" he said.But in a YouTube video posted in July, he tells another anti-5G activist how he helped convince Glastonbury Town Council to get the investigation underway. He encouraged others to organise local petitions.He has also appeared in videos alongside Mark Steele, another anti-5G conspiracy theorist. Mr Steele claims the coronavirus is a hoax, and has posted videos of himself harassing telecoms engineers. Mr Cooper says the committee was supposed to be made up of people who lived in the area or had a business there. He complained that Christopher Baker did not meet those requirements because he lived in Hampshire, which does not even border Somerset.He resigned after the complaint was ignored, describing Mr Baker as a ""semi-professional anti-5G activist"". He highlighted a video in which Mr Baker admitted some of his fuel costs were paid by a benefactor.Mr Baker told the BBC it was true that he lived in Hampshire, but said he had long-term connections to Glastonbury, and in any case other members of the committee were from outside the town. He admitted that he did receive some funding from a benefactor he refused to name. ""I don't have a lot of money, and if I travel half-way up the country to give a presentation, the least I expect is someone to contribute something towards my fuel bill.""He said those who resigned from the committee were dismissive of the evidence, rude to witnesses such as Prof Pall, and a disruptive force at the meetings. Committee chair Jon Cousins agreed: ""Some of the behaviours displayed by non-councillor members when they could not debate by 'reason' broke Glastonbury Town Council's code of conduct.""This is strongly denied by Mark Swann and his colleagues.The committee did hear evidence from Mobile UK, the mobile operators' trade body. Its presentation was criticised by one member for being ""glossy"", and others alleged there was no attempt to answer questions. Gareth Elliott of Mobile UK denied that: ""We answered everything that was asked of us."" However, he said it was a cordial meeting and his organisation respected the views of the committee.He recounts an incident where one committee member arrived late to a meeting. She said that although she was hyper-sensitive to electromagnetic emissions, she deemed the meeting room to be safe. ""It was then noted that a wi-fi router was operating and was in the room,"" he says.Those who resigned from the committee say they are concerned about the reputation of Glastonbury. Last month, Piers Corbyn - the brother of the former Labour leader - led an anti-lockdown protest in the town, where slogans against 5G were shouted. Mr Swann says the atmosphere in the town has been tense lately and he is worried about the impact of the 5G report.""This fallacious report severely damages Glastonbury's credibility,"" he says. ""It undermines years of good work by well-meaning councillors and leaves a dark shadow over the town's  reputation.""But Councillor Jon Cousins rejects the idea that the report may have served to encourage the conspiracy theorists. ""Glastonbury Town Council's position and resolutions around 5G do not - and have never - suggested a link between 5G and Covid-19 or indeed that coronavirus is a hoax."" He says the council worked closely with Avon and Somerset Police to deal with last month's demonstration and breaches of social distancing legislation.",16 May 2020,technology
Disney's head of streaming to become CEO of TikTok,"Disney's head of streaming Kevin Mayer is stepping down to become the boss of social media platform TikTok.He has been named the chief executive officer of TikTok and chief operating officer of ByteDance, the platform's Chinese parent company.TikTok, an app where users post short videos, has seen an explosion of growth since its US launch.But that increased popularity has led to scrutiny by the US government over its ties to China.Mr Mayer will be responsible for ByteDance's ""global development"" including emerging business, gaming and music.""I'm excited to help lead the next phase of ByteDance's journey as the company continues to expand its breadth of products across every region of the world,"" Mr Mayer said in the release.He will be the first CEO of TikTok. TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times on iOS and Android since it was launched globally in 2017.  The app allows users to make videos up to 15-seconds long with music in the background.The coronavirus pandemic has helped boost its popularity further with many users making comical or musical videos of their quarantine experiences.But having a Chinese parent company has worried US politicians. Some of them have raised concerns about ByteDance allowing Chinese government censorship or data collection on TikTok users. Both are charges ByteDance denies.At Disney, Mr Mayer oversaw the successful launch of the firms streaming service, Disney Plus in November of 2019. The service had over 54 million subscribers by May. He also managed the firms other streaming investments including Hulu, Hotstar, and sports streaming services ESPN plus.He was also considered a key figure in the company's acquisitions of Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel.  Before Disney's former chief executive Bob Iger stepped down from that role in February, Mr Mayer was viewed as a possible candidate to replace him. However, the role was given to Bob Chapek, head of parks, experiences and products.Mr Mayer will be joining ByteDance on 1 June.  ",19 May 2020,technology
Europe's supercomputers hijacked by attackers for crypto mining,"At least a dozen supercomputers across Europe have shut down after cyber-attacks tried to take control of them.A pan-European supercomputing group says they seem to have tried to use the machines to mine cryptocurrency.""A security exploitation"" disabled access to the Archer supercomputer, at the University of Edinburgh, on 11 May.Staff said they were working with the National Cyber Security Centre to restore the system, which had recently installed a pandemic modelling tool. ""We now believe this to be a major issue across the academic community as several computers have been compromised in the UK and elsewhere in Europe,"" the team said.The NCSC said: ""We are aware of this incident and are providing support. ""The NCSC works with the academic sector to help it improve its security practices and protect its institutions from threats.""Also on 11 May, another attack shut down five supercomputers in Germany.Others followed elsewhere in Germany in the following days, as well as in Switzerland, and reportedly Barcelona.They exploited an Secure Shell (SSH) connection, which academic researchers use to log in to the system remotely.And once inside, the attackers appear to have deployed cryptocurrency-mining malware.The security team at the European Group Infrastructure foundation said: ""A malicious group is currently targeting academic data centres for CPU [central processing unit] mining purposes. ""The attacker is hopping from one victim to another using compromised SSH credentials."" Jamie Akhtar, chief executive of UK security company Cybersmart, said: ""Universities are home to some of the most advanced research projects in the world across many disciplines - including computer science - but they are also notoriously vulnerable to attack if they are connected to the wider university network.""",18 May 2020,technology
