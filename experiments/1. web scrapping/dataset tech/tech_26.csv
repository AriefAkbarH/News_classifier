Coronavirus: What went wrong with the UK's contact tracing app?,"After months of work, the UK has ditched the way its coronavirus-tracing app works, prompting a blame game between the government and two of the world's biggest tech firms. So what went wrong?At the end of March, I got a text from a senior figure in the UK's technology industry. This person said they were helping the NHS ""on a very substantial project that will launch in days and potentially save hundreds of thousands of British lives.""That was the first I knew of the plan to build a contact tracing app, a project that soon appeared to be at the very centre of the government's strategy to beat coronavirus and help us all emerge from lockdown. The tech luminary had somehow assumed that I could be an adviser to the project - I made it clear that could not be my role but I was very interested in following its progress.Now, nearly three months on, after missing deadline after deadline, there has been a radical change in direction. The app that has been developed so far is being scrapped, and a new approach will be tried based on a system created by Apple and Google. But there is no guarantee when, if ever, this will be rolled out. So what went wrong?When the team from the NHSX digital division was assembled they were told they were engaged on a vital mission. According to a presentation the team was shown the Covid-19 app would have four aims:Once installed on a user's phone, the app would use Bluetooth to keep a record of other people with whom they came into close contact - as long as they too had installed the app. Then when someone tested positive for the virus, alerts would be sent to their close contacts of recent days telling them to go into quarantine.The epidemiological expertise was provided by a team of Oxford scientists who had argued that there was an urgent need to  identify people who were spreading the virus without knowing. ""Very fast contact tracing was likely to be essential,"" says one of the Oxford team, Dr David Bonsall. ""And smartphones have the technological capability to speed up that process.""But using the Bluetooth connection on smartphones to detect contacts was untested technology. Still, the team was inspired by Singapore, which had released its Trace Together app using that system.
12 April
Heath Secretary Matt Hancock announces the development of ""a new NHS app for contact tracing"".
5 May
The app is launched on the Isle of Wight. It is downloaded by 60&comma;000 people&comma; under half the population of the island&comma; over the following 10 days.  Mr Hancock tells BBC Breakfast that if the trial on the Isle of Wight is successful&comma; the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of May. He also says the public would have a ""duty"" to download the app and that 60% of people in the country would have to do so for the system to function.
20 May
Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells Parliament: ""We will have a test&comma; track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes it will be in place by 1 June."" He also says there will be 25&comma;000 trackers who ""will be able to cope with 10&comma;000 new cases a day"".
27 May
Contact-tracing system is launched without a nationwide app. Anybody who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive will have to self-isolate for 14 days. According to government figures&comma; in the first week tracers contact 5&comma;407 people with the virus.
5 June
Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the app tested on the Isle of Wight will ""be running as soon as we think it is robust"". Speaking on BBC Question Time&comma; the minister says: ""I can't give you an exact date&comma; it would be wrong for me to do so."" Asked to confirm it would be rolled out nationwide this month&comma; he says: ""I'd like to think we'd be able to manage by this month&comma; yes.""
17 June
Lord Bethell&comma; the Minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care&comma; says the app ""isn’t the priority"". Answering a question about the app from the Science and Technology Committee&comma; the minister says: ""We are seeking to get something going for the winter&comma; but it isn't the priority for us at the moment."" He declines to offer a launch date for the app.

In a major U-turn&comma; the UK ditches its version and shifts to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google. The Apple-Google design is promoted as being more privacy-focused. However&comma; it means epidemiologists will have access to less data.But it soon became clear that using Bluetooth was tricky. Reports from Singapore suggested people were reluctant to download the app because it had to be kept open on the phone all the time, draining the battery.Then on 10 April came a surprising announcement from Google and Apple. The two tech giants - on whose software virtually all the world's smartphones depend - said they were going to develop a system that would help Bluetooth contact-tracing apps work smoothly. But there was a catch - only privacy-focused apps would be allowed to use the platform.Apple and Google favoured decentralised apps, where the matching between infected people and their list of contacts happened between their phones. The alternative was for the matching to be done on a central computer, owned by a health authority, which would end up storing lots of very sensitive information.The app the NHS was developing was based on a centralised model, which the Oxford scientists felt was vital if the health service was to be able to monitor virus outbreaks properly.Two days later, with quite a fanfare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock unveiled the plans for the Covid-19 app, promising ""all data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research"". But immediately privacy campaigners, politicians and technology experts raised concerns. ""I recognise the overwhelming force of the public health arguments for a centralised system, but I also have 25 years' experience of the NHS being incompetent at developing systems and repeatedly breaking their privacy promises,"" said Cambridge University's Prof Ross Anderson.Yet the project was still gathering pace with the first trial of the app at RAF Leeming, in Yorkshire. The trial was held under artificial conditions, with servicemen and women placing phones adjacent to each other on tables to see what happened.Meanwhile, privacy-conscious Germany became the latest country to switch its app to the decentralised model, using the Apple and Google system. It seemed that Apple had made it clear that it would not cooperate with a centralised app.Michael Veale, a British academic working with a consortium developing decentralised apps, warned that the NHS app was on the wrong path, asking on Twitter ""will the UK push ahead with an app that will not work on iPhones - which has devastated adoption in Singapore?""But the UK pushed ahead with a trial in the Isle of Wight. As it got underway Mr Hancock told the public they had a ""duty"" to download the app when it became available and that it would be crucial in getting ""our liberty back"" as the lockdown was eased.First sight of the app showed it was very simple, asking users whether they had a fever or a continuous cough. But any symptom alerts sent out to contacts merely echoed the standard ""stay alert"" advice - test results couldn't be entered into the app at this stage. It left many residents confused.Still, the fact that the app was quickly downloaded by more than half of the island's smartphone users saw the government branding the trial a success.Meanwhile, the Financial Times revealed that the government had hired a Swiss software developer to build a second app, using the Apple and Google technology. NHS insiders were quick to downplay the significance of this move - although one admitted ""Downing Street is getting nervous"".Work continued on a second, more sophisticated version of the original app, which was again going to be tested in the Isle of Wight before a national rollout - though the original deadline of mid-May had been missed.On 20 May, however, it became clear that the government's focus was switching to manual-contact tracing. The prime minister announced that a ""world beating"" tracing system would be in place by the beginning of June, though Number 10 stressed that the app's contribution to the system would come a bit later.As May drew to a close the boss of the wider test and trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, said the app would be the ""cherry on the cake"" of the project. It was no longer the cake itself.By early June, more deadlines for the national release of the app had come and gone. Three weeks into the Isle of Wight trial residents were getting restless, with very little information on how it was going or when an updated version of the app was coming.France launched its centralised Stop-Covid app, which had drawn heavy criticism from privacy campaigners, and digital minister Cedric O said 600,000 downloads in the first few hours was ""a good start"".On 4 June, Business Minister Nadhim Zadhawi was coaxed into saying the app should be ready by the end of the month, but that was the last firm deadline that would be promised.Singapore, which had continued to struggle to make its contact tracing app work, announced plans to give all citizens a wearable device in the hope that this would do a better job than a smartphone.On 14 June, Germany became the biggest country to launch a decentralised app on the Apple/Google platform. It quickly outstripped France in terms of downloads with something approaching 10% of the population installing it. By now the silence from the UK government about the NHS app was deafening. What was going on?Around lunchtime on 18 June all became clear. The BBC broke the story that the government was abandoning the centralised app and moving to something based on Google and Apple's technology. Despite all the spin, the Isle of Wight trial had highlighted a disastrous flaw in the app - it failed to detect 96% of contacts with Apple iPhones.The blame game has already begun. Mr Hancock and some of the scientists working with the NHS believe Apple should have been more cooperative. Technology experts and privacy campaigners say they warned months ago how this story would end.Apple says it did not know the UK was working on a ""hybrid"" version of the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app using tech it developed with Google.Meanwhile, there is scant proof from anywhere around the world that smartphone apps using Bluetooth are an effective method of contact tracing. Back in March, it seemed that the hugely powerful devices most of us carry with us might help us emerge from this health crisis. Now it looks as though a human being on the end of a phone is a far better option.",20 June 2020,technology

Katie Hopkins permanently suspended from Twitter,"Controversial commentator Katie Hopkins has been permanently suspended from Twitter for violating its hateful conduct policy, the social media giant said.Ms Hopkins, who had more than one million followers, was previously suspended in January for a week.But Twitter said her latest ban is permanent.The social network did not, however, say which tweets Ms Hopkins had posted, to result in the ban.""Keeping Twitter safe is a top priority for us - abuse and hateful conduct have no place on our service and we will continue to take action when our rules are broken,"" it said.The cited hateful conduct policy bans promotion of violence or direct written attacks and threats on other people, based on a wide range of personal characteristics such as race, gender or sexual orientation.Ms Hopkins is well-known for both her media appearances and controversial right-wing viewpoints.She has been re-tweeted by US President Donald Trump on several occasions.Twitter has recently taken a firmer line against Mr Trump himself over tweets it says break its policies.The US President has seen warnings placed on some of his tweets and others hidden from general view, although they remain online.But leaving such tweets up in the public interest is an exception Twitter makes for world leaders - other accounts like Ms Hopkins' risk being suspended when they break Twitter's rules.",19 June 2020,technology
Apple 'not told' about UK's latest app plans,"Apple says it did not know the UK was working on a ""hybrid"" version of the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app using tech it developed with Google.The firm took the unusual step of saying it was also unaware of an issue regarding distance-measuring, which was flagged by Health Secretary Matt Hancock in Thursday's daily briefing.Apple said it was ""difficult to understand"" the claims.Downing Street said the government had ""worked closely with Apple and Google"".In tests carried out in the UK, there were occasions when software tools developed by Apple and Google could not differentiate between a phone in a user's pocket 1m (3.3ft) away and a phone in a user's hand 3m (9.8ft) away.During the briefing, Mr Hancock said: ""Measuring distance is clearly mission critical to any contact-tracing app.""However, speaking to the Times, Apple said: ""It is difficult to understand what these claims are as they haven't spoken to us.""The firm also pointed out that the tech was already either in use or intended for use in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Ireland.The tech giant also expressed surprise that the UK was working on a new version of the contact-tracing app which incorporated the Apple-Google software tool.""We've agreed to join forces with Google and Apple, to bring the best bits of both systems together,"" Mr Hancock said.However, Apple said: ""We don't know what they mean by this hybrid model. They haven't spoken to us about it.""It told the BBC it had nothing further to add.On Friday, the Department of Health said the NHS's digital innovation unit had indeed discussed its ambitions with Apple.""NHSX has been working with Google and Apple extensively since their API [application programming interface ] was made available,"" it told the BBC.""Over the last few weeks, senior representatives from NHSX and Apple have had productive meetings to discuss both products and future direction.""There is a commitment between the teams to work together to improve the distance measurement technology, which is integral to have a fully functioning contract-tracing app.""Google said yesterday that it welcomed the government's announcement.A Downing Street spokesman said the government continued to work closely with both Apple and Google on the app, and had done so since development began.""We've agreed with them to take forward our work on estimating distance through the app that we've developed and work to incorporate that into their app,"" he said.Apple and Google have not created an app. What they have built is a software tool which enables contact-tracing apps to work more smoothly with both iPhones and Android devices, but which does not store any data centrally.The UK wanted to store the data as it argued it would be useful for scientists tracking the spread of Covid-19.Dr David Bonsall from Oxford University, who is an adviser to the NHS app developers, told the BBC the tech giant had made a choice not to support the UK's original model.""Ultimately, a decision was taken by Apple to not support the centralised system that had been in development by the UK from March, and six weeks before they announced their own system under a decentralised model,"" he said.""And that has got to be considered in our reflection on the situation that the UK now faces.""The now-abandoned NHS app was tested on the Isle of Wight where it was downloaded more than 50,000 times. However, it registered only about 4% of the iPhones that were nearby.Islanders have now been asked to delete it.It's not the first time the government has clashed with Apple over an app - in 2018 an app built to help EU citizens apply to remain in the UK after Brexit was also found to not work properly on iPhones.On that occasion Apple did eventually agree to make the necessary changes to its system.",19 June 2020,technology
Apple's annual developer showcase overshadowed by app row,"Apple is facing mounting pressure over how it runs its app store ahead of its major global developers' conference, which starts on Monday.The firm has been accused of creating ""hostile"" policies within its fee structure, and is dealing with two EU competition probes announced this week.But it is also embroiled in a row with some of its own developers.That has now widened into a debate involving politicians and other major technology firms. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference often features new product announcements but is mainly an event for software developers working on Apple's platforms - some of whom are now voicing discontent about its pricing.The argument was ignited in part by an email app called Hey, created by developer David Heinemeier Hansson. It had an update rejected by the Apple app store early this week because it does not allow in-app purchases - from which Apple takes a 30% cut.Wow. I'm literally stunned. Apple just doubled down on their rejection of HEY's ability to provide bug fixes and new features, unless we submit to their outrageous demand of 15-30% of our revenue. Even worse: We're told that unless we comply, they'll REMOVE THE APP.End of Twitter post  by @dhhMany developers do not offer in-app subscriptions to avoid that levy - or raise the price of in-app subscriptions for the end user.But not all apps are affected, Mr Hansson says. He pointed to email apps from Gmail and Microsoft's Outlook, which he says are treated differently, but which Apple would not discuss with him. Hey's annual subscription of $99 (£80) is available only directly from the company online, and the app does not tell users where to buy it - so the firm believed it was following all the rules, similar to other email apps.But Apple told him the app should never have been approved in the first place - and could be removed.""If we don't like the deal Apple is offering us - which is to either pay them 30% or get kicked out - what are we going to do about that? Where are we going to go?"" he told the BBC.""If you launch a new piece of software today, and you're not available on the iPhone, you're invisible.""The cry has now been taken up by others, including blogger John Gruber, whose blog, Daring Fireball, is widely read among Apple developers. He wrote that if Hey's issues were not a mistake, the decision was ""outrageous"".Such issues are behind an anti-competition probe announced by the EU this week, prompted by a complaint from Spotify. The Swedish firm also takes issue with Apple's approach to charging subscriptions and the cut it takes.The anti-competition probe, coinciding with the row over Hey's business model, has snowballed into a much bigger argument.Microsoft President Brad Smith entered the debate, saying that regulators on both sides of the Atlantic should have a ""focused conversation"" about app stores and the rules in place - though he did not mention Apple by name.Microsoft has itself been the subject of competition probes, hit with hefty fines over its dominant market position with Microsoft Windows and its web browser.But he said the restrictions and demands placed on developers today are far higher than anything that existed 20 years ago, at the height of Microsoft's software dominance.Facebook, meanwhile, told the New York Times that its Gaming app had been rejected from Apple's app store five times.Sources who spoke to the newspaper said it might be because the app offers simple games that do not have to be downloaded in the traditional way - through Apple's store.Even the chairman of the House antitrust committee - the group of politicians that deals with competition law in the United States - has voiced his concern.""Because of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents - highway robbery, basically - bullying people to pay 30% or denying access to their market,"" David Cicilline told The Verge.""It's crushing small developers who simply can't survive with those kinds of payments. If there were real competition in this marketplace, this wouldn't happen.""The committee has asked the heads of major tech companies - including Tim Cook at Apple - to attend a session about competition in the tech sector. Mr Cook, it is reported, has yet to agree to attend.But despite the international attention on Apple's policies, its head of marketing, Phil Schiller, told Techcrunch the company was not considering any changes to its rules.",19 June 2020,technology
Twitter labels Trump tweet 'manipulated media' for first time,"Twitter has labelled a video tweeted by US President Donald Trump as having ""manipulated media"" for the first time.The video shows a black child running away from a white child while playing, with a fake CNN caption.The caption reads: ""Terrified toddler runs from racist baby"", before the video accuses CNN of ""fake news"".Twitter's decision to place a large warning label on the video is the latest escalation in a row between Twitter and the president.In late May, Twitter added fact-checking verification notices to the president's tweets for the first time, following up two days later with hiding some tweets behind a warning.Mr Trump responded by signing an executive order that seeks to curb the long-standing legal protections of social media firms.This latest warning is the first time Twitter has used the ""manipulated media"" warning on one of the president's tweets - designed to indicate the photo or video has been significantly edited.It also comes at a time of increased racial tension in the United States and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement.After the initial shot of the children running, another caption appears: ""Racist baby probably a Trump voter."" It then cuts to text promising ""what actually happened"", showing the original context of the two children at play - as CNN did in its original report in September of last year.""America is not the problem. Fake news is,"" the video declares before it ends.But clicking on the prominent warning that Twitter attached to the tweet brings users to a page where Twitter warns: ""The president shared a version of the video which many journalists confirmed was edited and doctored with a fake CNN chyron.""By Marianna Spring, specialist disinformation reporterTwitter has doubled down on its efforts to fact-check misinformation amplified by President Trump in recent weeks. It previously had a more hands-off approach - one that Facebook still favours, although Facebook did remove Trump campaign adverts that featured a Nazi symbol yesterday. One problem for Twitter, however, is consistency. It remains unclear why some misinformation promoted by the US president is tagged, while misleading claims from him and other large Twitter accounts are left unchecked. It's also worth pointing out that this is a clear attack on CNN. The media organisation has frequently found itself a target of Trump's cries of ""fake news"". But in recent weeks, its journalists - and those from other outlets - have also been the target of physical attacks during protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. Here, the issue of ""fake news"" quite obviously comes back to President Trump, though. He is plugging it to his millions of followers online. ""I think the president was making satirical point that was quite funny if you go and actually watch the video,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Friday.""The point was it was a play on CNN reportedly taking the repeatedly taking him out of context.""CNN's communications department also tweeted back at the president with a terse response.""CNN did cover this story - exactly as it happened. Just as we reported your positions on race (and poll numbers),"" it wrote.""We'll continue working with facts rather than tweeting fake videos that exploit innocent children. We invite you to do the same. Be better.""A watermark on the video in the president's tweet indicates it was originally made by  a pro-Trump Twitter user who goes by the name Carpe Donktum.""Thanks CNN, you gave my video three top 20 (two top five) trending spots,"" he wrote.  ""I haven't had this much fun since you freaked out about the Time Magazine cover!""On Friday, Facerbook removed the same video after a complaint from after one of the children's parents fielded a copyright claim, CNN reported.Jukin Media, which owns the rights to the video, said in a statement: ""Neither the video owner nor Jukin Media gave the President permission to post the video, and after our review, we believe that his unauthorised usage of the content is a clear example of copyright infringement without valid fair use or other defense.""According to CNN, the video had more than four million views before its removal.",19 June 2020,technology

According to a presentation the team was shown the Covid-19 app would have four aims:Once installed on a user's phone, the app would use Bluetooth to keep a record of other people with whom they came into close contact - as long as they too had installed the app. Then when someone tested positive for the virus, alerts would be sent to their close contacts of recent days telling them to go into quarantine.The epidemiological expertise was provided by a team of Oxford scientists who had argued that there was an urgent need to  identify people who were spreading the virus without knowing. ""Very fast contact tracing was likely to be essential,"" says one of the Oxford team, Dr David Bonsall. ""And smartphones have the technological capability to speed up that process.""But using the Bluetooth connection on smartphones to detect contacts was untested technology. Still, the team was inspired by Singapore, which had released its Trace Together app using that system.
12 April
Heath Secretary Matt Hancock announces the development of ""a new NHS app for contact tracing"".
5 May
The app is launched on the Isle of Wight. It is downloaded by 60&comma;000 people&comma; under half the population of the island&comma; over the following 10 days.  Mr Hancock tells BBC Breakfast that if the trial on the Isle of Wight is successful&comma; the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of May. He also says the public would have a ""duty"" to download the app and that 60% of people in the country would have to do so for the system to function.
20 May
Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells Parliament: ""We will have a test&comma; track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes it will be in place by 1 June."" He also says there will be 25&comma;000 trackers who ""will be able to cope with 10&comma;000 new cases a day"".
27 May
Contact-tracing system is launched without a nationwide app. Anybody who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive will have to self-isolate for 14 days. According to government figures&comma; in the first week tracers contact 5&comma;407 people with the virus.
5 June
Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the app tested on the Isle of Wight will ""be running as soon as we think it is robust"". Speaking on BBC Question Time&comma; the minister says: ""I can't give you an exact date&comma; it would be wrong for me to do so."" Asked to confirm it would be rolled out nationwide this month&comma; he says: ""I'd like to think we'd be able to manage by this month&comma; yes.""
17 June
Lord Bethell&comma; the Minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care&comma; says the app ""isn’t the priority"". Answering a question about the app from the Science and Technology Committee&comma; the minister says: ""We are seeking to get something going for the winter&comma; but it isn't the priority for us at the moment."" He declines to offer a launch date for the app.
18 June
In a major U-turn&comma; the UK ditches its version and shifts to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google. The Apple-Google design is promoted as being more privacy-focused. However&comma; it means epidemiologists will have access to less data.But it soon became clear that using Bluetooth was tricky. Reports from Singapore suggested people were reluctant to download the app because it had to be kept open on the phone all the time, draining the battery.Then on 10 April came a surprising announcement from Google and Apple. The two tech giants - on whose software virtually all the world's smartphones depend - said they were going to develop a system that would help Bluetooth contact-tracing apps work smoothly. But there was a catch - only privacy-focused apps would be allowed to use the platform.Apple and Google favoured decentralised apps, where the matching between infected people and their list of contacts happened between their phones. The alternative was for the matching to be done on a central computer, owned by a health authority, which would end up storing lots of very sensitive information.The app the NHS was developing was based on a centralised model, which the Oxford scientists felt was vital if the health service was to be able to monitor virus outbreaks properly.Two days later, with quite a fanfare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock unveiled the plans for the Covid-19 app, promising ""all data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research"". But immediately privacy campaigners, politicians and technology experts raised concerns. ""I recognise the overwhelming force of the public health arguments for a centralised system, but I also have 25 years' experience of the NHS being incompetent at developing systems and repeatedly breaking their privacy promises,"" said Cambridge University's Prof Ross Anderson.Yet the project was still gathering pace with the first trial of the app at RAF Leeming, in Yorkshire. The trial was held under artificial conditions, with servicemen and women placing phones adjacent to each other on tables to see what happened.Meanwhile, privacy-conscious Germany became the latest country to switch its app to the decentralised model, using the Apple and Google system. It seemed that Apple had made it clear that it would not cooperate with a centralised app.Michael Veale, a British academic working with a consortium developing decentralised apps, warned that the NHS app was on the wrong path, asking on Twitter ""will the UK push ahead with an app that will not work on iPhones - which has devastated adoption in Singapore?""But the UK pushed ahead with a trial in the Isle of Wight. As it got underway Mr Hancock told the public they had a ""duty"" to download the app when it became available and that it would be crucial in getting ""our liberty back"" as the lockdown was eased.First sight of the app showed it was very simple, asking users whether they had a fever or a continuous cough. But any symptom alerts sent out to contacts merely echoed the standard ""stay alert"" advice - test results couldn't be entered into the app at this stage. It left many residents confused.Still, the fact that the app was quickly downloaded by more than half of the island's smartphone users saw the government branding the trial a success.Meanwhile, the Financial Times revealed that the government had hired a Swiss software developer to build a second app, using the Apple and Google technology. NHS insiders were quick to downplay the significance of this move - although one admitted ""Downing Street is getting nervous"".Work continued on a second, more sophisticated version of the original app, which was again going to be tested in the Isle of Wight before a national rollout - though the original deadline of mid-May had been missed.On 20 May, however, it became clear that the government's focus was switching to manual-contact tracing. The prime minister announced that a ""world beating"" tracing system would be in place by the beginning of June, though Number 10 stressed that the app's contribution to the system would come a bit later.As May drew to a close the boss of the wider test and trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, said the app would be the ""cherry on the cake"" of the project. It was no longer the cake itself.By early June, more deadlines for the national release of the app had come and gone. Three weeks into the Isle of Wight trial residents were getting restless, with very little information on how it was going or when an updated version of the app was coming.France launched its centralised Stop-Covid app, which had drawn heavy criticism from privacy campaigners, and digital minister Cedric O said 600,000 downloads in the first few hours was ""a good start"".On 4 June, Business Minister Nadhim Zadhawi was coaxed into saying the app should be ready by the end of the month, but that was the last firm deadline that would be promised.Singapore, which had continued to struggle to make its contact tracing app work, announced plans to give all citizens a wearable device in the hope that this would do a better job than a smartphone.On 14 June, Germany became the biggest country to launch a decentralised app on the Apple/Google platform. It quickly outstripped France in terms of downloads with something approaching 10% of the population installing it. By now the silence from the UK government about the NHS app was deafening. What was going on?Around lunchtime on 18 June all became clear. The BBC broke the story that the government was abandoning the centralised app and moving to something based on Google and Apple's technology. Despite all the spin, the Isle of Wight trial had highlighted a disastrous flaw in the app - it failed to detect 96% of contacts with Apple iPhones.The blame game has already begun. Mr Hancock and some of the scientists working with the NHS believe Apple should have been more cooperative. Technology experts and privacy campaigners say they warned months ago how this story would end.Apple says it did not know the UK was working on a ""hybrid"" version of the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app using tech it developed with Google.Meanwhile, there is scant proof from anywhere around the world that smartphone apps using Bluetooth are an effective method of contact tracing. Back in March, it seemed that the hugely powerful devices most of us carry with us might help us emerge from this health crisis. Now it looks as though a human being on the end of a phone is a far better option.",20 June 2020,technology

Apple's annual developer showcase overshadowed by app row,"Apple is facing mounting pressure over how it runs its app store ahead of its major global developers' conference, which starts on Monday.The firm has been accused of creating ""hostile"" policies within its fee structure, and is dealing with two EU competition probes announced this week.But it is also embroiled in a row with some of its own developers.That has now widened into a debate involving politicians and other major technology firms. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference often features new product announcements but is mainly an event for software developers working on Apple's platforms - some of whom are now voicing discontent about its pricing.The argument was ignited in part by an email app called Hey, created by developer David Heinemeier Hansson. It had an update rejected by the Apple app store early this week because it does not allow in-app purchases - from which Apple takes a 30% cut.Many developers do not offer in-app subscriptions to avoid that levy - or raise the price of in-app subscriptions for the end user.But not all apps are affected, Mr Hansson says. He pointed to email apps from Gmail and Microsoft's Outlook, which he says are treated differently, but which Apple would not discuss with him. Hey's annual subscription of $99 (£80) is available only directly from the company online, and the app does not tell users where to buy it - so the firm believed it was following all the rules, similar to other email apps.But Apple told him the app should never have been approved in the first place - and could be removed.""If we don't like the deal Apple is offering us - which is to either pay them 30% or get kicked out - what are we going to do about that? Where are we going to go?"" he told the BBC.""If you launch a new piece of software today, and you're not available on the iPhone, you're invisible.""The cry has now been taken up by others, including blogger John Gruber, whose blog, Daring Fireball, is widely read among Apple developers. He wrote that if Hey's issues were not a mistake, the decision was ""outrageous"".Such issues are behind an anti-competition probe announced by the EU this week, prompted by a complaint from Spotify. The Swedish firm also takes issue with Apple's approach to charging subscriptions and the cut it takes.The anti-competition probe, coinciding with the row over Hey's business model, has snowballed into a much bigger argument.Microsoft President Brad Smith entered the debate, saying that regulators on both sides of the Atlantic should have a ""focused conversation"" about app stores and the rules in place - though he did not mention Apple by name.Microsoft has itself been the subject of competition probes, hit with hefty fines over its dominant market position with Microsoft Windows and its web browser.But he said the restrictions and demands placed on developers today are far higher than anything that existed 20 years ago, at the height of Microsoft's software dominance.Facebook, meanwhile, told the New York Times that its Gaming app had been rejected from Apple's app store five times.Sources who spoke to the newspaper said it might be because the app offers simple games that do not have to be downloaded in the traditional way - through Apple's store.Even the chairman of the House antitrust committee - the group of politicians that deals with competition law in the United States - has voiced his concern.""Because of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents - highway robbery, basically - bullying people to pay 30% or denying access to their market,"" David Cicilline told The Verge.""It's crushing small developers who simply can't survive with those kinds of payments.

Tech takeovers feed into China Cold War fears,"The UK government is planning new measures to restrict foreign takeovers on national security grounds.

And it flared up into a row that goes to the heart of on an increasingly contentious issue - has the UK failed to stop high-tech industries passing into Chinese hands?In 2017, Imagination Technologies, a Hertfordshire-based company at the cutting edge of computer-chip design, whose tech is used on iPhones, was bought by Canyon Bridge Partners, a private equity firm based in the Cayman Islands. But 99% of the funds for the purchase came from China Reform, backed by the state in Beijing.  And this spring, Canyon Bridge Partners tried to install new directors linked to China Reform.One of those to raise the alarm, Sir Hossein Yassaie, a former chief executive of the company, feared assurances it would not be moved to China were at risk of being broken. ""It looked like there was an attempt to basically change the ownership and control of the company,"" he told a documentary made for BBC Radio 4 .""My stance on Imagination is fundamentally about making sure a very important ecosystem... is maintained as an independent, properly governed supplier.""The issue was taken up by Tom Tugendhat MP, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, which held a hearing in May. Canyon Bridge denied China had any untoward influence over the purchase or its activities, arguing the decisions were purely commercial.And some of the changes were halted. But those involved believe it was an indication of a wider problem.""This is just part of an incremental process where technology is being moved out of the UK, and out of the West, and towards China,"" Mr Tugendhat says.Has the UK been too ready to allow some of its ""crown jewel"" technology companies to be sold into foreign hands?  ""The simple answer unfortunately is, 'Yes.'"" Sir Hossein says.And Elisabeth Braw, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, believes many other cases in which cutting edge technology have shifted to China have gone unreported.  ""The UK has been late to understand this,"" she says. ""It sort of goes against this idea that globalisation is a force for good, if you start saying, 'Well, we need to scrutinise foreign investors.'But actually the world has changed and China is exploiting globalisation for its own gains.""Theresa May's government announced plans to look at the issue in 2018.A bill promising new powers to assess mergers and takeovers was promised in the Queen's Speech last December. And in May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said parliamentarians were ""right to be concerned"" about the buying up of UK technology by countries that had ""ulterior motives"", and promised new measures in the coming weeks.Others have already acted. The purchase of a robotics manufacturer by a Chinese company led Germany in 2017 to place new restrictions on takeovers.US intelligence officials have also increasingly focused on looking for a hidden hand from the Chinese state in business deals.""You might see an acquisition and on its face it makes all the sense in the world,"" US National Counterintelligence and Security Center director Bill Evanina told BBC News.""But there needs to be intelligence services peeling back that onion to identify who the backdoor owners are and who the financiers of that acquisition are.""Mr Evanina says that, after having been ""a little bit slow, in the last two to three years"", the US government has become more active in warning the private sector. In the UK, MI5 plays a similar role and informs decisions about whether technology takeovers are in the national interest - but few have been stopped.One of the more surprising rows came after the gay dating site Grindr was purchased by a Chinese company. The US raised national security concerns because of the fear the personal data could be used to compromise or influence individuals.And the company was eventually sold. ""The regulator realised that having that information at the disposal of the Chinese government ultimately was a very bad idea for US national security,"" Ms Braw says.""We need to change our understanding of which companies are vital to national security and treat them just like we treated defence companies in the Cold War"". One concern for Mr Evanina is the extent to which China can use a combination of acquisitions, its own technology companies and cyber-espionage to build up large databases of personal information. ""The ability to have information on every human in the world that that human doesn't even have on themselves provides them with a strategic advantage, not only from an espionage perspective but a compromise perspective [and] understanding plans and intentions of companies,"" he says.The New Tech Cold War will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:00 on Friday and again on Tuesday at 16:00",19 June 2020,technology

UK virus-tracing app switches to Apple-Google model,"In a major U-turn, the UK is ditching the way its current coronavirus-tracing app works and shifting to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google.The Apple-Google design has been promoted as being more privacy-focused.However, it means epidemiologists will have access to less data.The government now intends to launch an app in the autumn, however it says the product may not involve contact tracing at that point.Instead the software may be limited to enabling users to report their symptoms and order a test.Baroness Dido Harding - who heads up the wider Test and Trace programme - will only give the green light to actually deploying the Apple-Google technology if she judges it to be fit for purpose, which she does not believe is the case at present. It is possible this may never happen.Germany, Italy and Denmark are among other countries to have switched from a so-called ""centralised"" approach to a ""decentralised"" one.The NHS has been testing both systems against each other, over the course of the past month.The centralised version trialled on the Isle of Wight worked well at assessing the distance between two users, but was poor at recognising Apple's iPhones.Specifically, the software registered about 75% of nearby Android handsets but only 4% of iPhones.By contrast, the Apple-Google model logged 99% of both Android mobiles and iPhones. But its distance calculations were weaker. In some instances, it could not differentiate between a phone in a user's pocket 1m (3.3ft) away and a phone in a user's hand 3m (9.8ft) away.Experiments in Ireland have flagged a similar issue.At the Downing Street briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock suggested the original plan might have worked had it not been for Apple's restrictions on third-party apps' use of Bluetooth.""Apple software prevents iPhones being used effectively for contact tracing unless you're using Apple's own technology,"" he said.""Our app won't work because Apple won't change that system... and their app can't measure distance well enough to a standard that we are satisfied with.""What matters is what works. Because what works will save lives.""Baroness Harding added: ""What we've done in really rigorously testing both our own Covid-19 app and the Google-Apple version is demonstrate that none of them are working sufficiently well enough to be actually reliable to determine whether any of us should self-isolate for two weeks [and] that's true across the world.""In response, Google noted that it and Apple had developed an application programming interface - a set of functions and procedures for others to build on - rather than a fully-fledged app.""We have developed an Exposure Notification API with Apple based on consultation with public health experts around the world, including in the UK, to ensure that our efforts are useful to authorities as they build their own apps to limit the spread of Covid-19, while ensuring privacy and security are central to the design,"" added a spokeswoman.The latest developments come a day after the BBC revealed that a former Apple executive, Simon Thompson, was taking charge of the late-running project as part of Baroness Harding's team.Contact-tracing apps are designed to help prevent a second wave of the coronavirus.They work by logging when two people have been in close proximity to each other for a substantial period of time.If one of the users is later diagnosed as having the disease, an alert can be sent to others they have recently been close to, telling them that they should also get tested and/or self-isolate.The UK's previous ""centralised"" design carried out the contact-matches on a remote server.The Apple-Google model carries the process out on the handsets themselves, making it more difficult for the authorities or potentially hackers to de-anonymise the records and use them for other means.One advantage of the switch - if deployed - is that the NHS Covid-19 app would be able to overcome a limitation of iPhones and carry out Bluetooth ""handshakes"" when the software is running in the background.Another is that it should be easier to make the app compatible with other countries' counterparts, which are based on the same system - including the Republic of Ireland and Germany.Earlier in the week, the European Commission said that France - which had adopted a centralised app - would face challenges in this regard.""This is a welcome, if a heavily and unnecessarily delayed, move,"" commented Dr Michael Veale from the DP3T group, which promotes the decentralised model.""The Google-Apple system in a way is home-grown: originating with research at a large consortium of universities led by Switzerland and including UCL in the UK.""He added that developers should be able to adapt code already being used by Germany and Switzerland if required.If Baroness Harding decides the Apple-Google tech is never good enough to roll out, then another alternative might be a system based on wearable tech.Singapore recently ordered 300,000 dongles to test as an alternative. Rather than uploading data over the internet, users will physically hand them over if they test positive for the virus, allowing recent contacts to be flagged.Baroness Harding's team is monitoring it and other innovations, but for now intends to focus on manual contact tracing carried out by humans.While the government is still set to launch an app of some kind across England, health is a devolved issue.As a consequence, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have still to commit to the initiative.""We will continue to work with the UK government to gather the information we need on data integration, technical information and overall timescales before making any decisions on whether or not to support its use,"" a spokesman for the Scottish government told the BBC.A spokeswoman for the Northern Ireland Executive added: ""People in Northern Ireland already have access to a symptom checker and advice app called Covid-19 NI, which more than 50,000 have downloaded and use regularly. This helps people to improve access to information, particularly when they have been advised to self-isolate.""",18 June 2020,technology
Coronavirus: What went wrong with the UK's contact tracing app?,"After months of work, the UK has ditched the way its coronavirus-tracing app works, prompting a blame game between the government and two of the world's biggest tech firms. So what went wrong?At the end of March, I got a text from a senior figure in the UK's technology industry. This person said they were helping the NHS ""on a very substantial project that will launch in days and potentially save hundreds of thousands of British lives.""That was the first I knew of the plan to build a contact tracing app, a project that soon appeared to be at the very centre of the government's strategy to beat coronavirus and help us all emerge from lockdown. The tech luminary had somehow assumed that I could be an adviser to the project - I made it clear that could not be my role but I was very interested in following its progress.Now, nearly three months on, after missing deadline after deadline, there has been a radical change in direction. The app that has been developed so far is being scrapped, and a new approach will be tried based on a system created by Apple and Google. But there is no guarantee when, if ever, this will be rolled out. So what went wrong?When the team from the NHSX digital division was assembled they were told they were engaged on a vital mission. According to a presentation the team was shown the Covid-19 app would have four aims:Once installed on a user's phone, the app would use Bluetooth to keep a record of other people with whom they came into close contact - as long as they too had installed the app. Then when someone tested positive for the virus, alerts would be sent to their close contacts of recent days telling them to go into quarantine.The epidemiological expertise was provided by a team of Oxford scientists who had argued that there was an urgent need to  identify people who were spreading the virus without knowing. ""Very fast contact tracing was likely to be essential,"" says one of the Oxford team, Dr David Bonsall. ""And smartphones have the technological capability to speed up that process.""But using the Bluetooth connection on smartphones to detect contacts was untested technology. Still, the team was inspired by Singapore, which had released its Trace Together app using that system.
12 April
Heath Secretary Matt Hancock announces the development of ""a new NHS app for contact tracing"".
5 May
The app is launched on the Isle of Wight. It is downloaded by 60&comma;000 people&comma; under half the population of the island&comma; over the following 10 days.  Mr Hancock tells BBC Breakfast that if the trial on the Isle of Wight is successful&comma; the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of May. He also says the public would have a ""duty"" to download the app and that 60% of people in the country would have to do so for the system to function.
20 May
Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells Parliament: ""We will have a test&comma; track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes it will be in place by 1 June."" He also says there will be 25&comma;000 trackers who ""will be able to cope with 10&comma;000 new cases a day"".
27 May
Contact-tracing system is launched without a nationwide app. Anybody who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive will have to self-isolate for 14 days. According to government figures&comma; in the first week tracers contact 5&comma;407 people with the virus.
5 June
Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the app tested on the Isle of Wight will ""be running as soon as we think it is robust"". Speaking on BBC Question Time&comma; the minister says: ""I can't give you an exact date&comma; it would be wrong for me to do so."" Asked to confirm it would be rolled out nationwide this month&comma; he says: ""I'd like to think we'd be able to manage by this month&comma; yes.""
17 June
Lord Bethell&comma; the Minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care&comma; says the app ""isn’t the priority"". Answering a question about the app from the Science and Technology Committee&comma; the minister says: ""We are seeking to get something going for the winter&comma; but it isn't the priority for us at the moment."" He declines to offer a launch date for the app.
18 June
In a major U-turn&comma; the UK ditches its version and shifts to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google. The Apple-Google design is promoted as being more privacy-focused. However&comma; it means epidemiologists will have access to less data.But it soon became clear that using Bluetooth was tricky. Reports from Singapore suggested people were reluctant to download the app because it had to be kept open on the phone all the time, draining the battery.Then on 10 April came a surprising announcement from Google and Apple. The two tech giants - on whose software virtually all the world's smartphones depend - said they were going to develop a system that would help Bluetooth contact-tracing apps work smoothly. But there was a catch - only privacy-focused apps would be allowed to use the platform.Apple and Google favoured decentralised apps, where the matching between infected people and their list of contacts happened between their phones. The alternative was for the matching to be done on a central computer, owned by a health authority, which would end up storing lots of very sensitive information.The app the NHS was developing was based on a centralised model, which the Oxford scientists felt was vital if the health service was to be able to monitor virus outbreaks properly.Two days later, with quite a fanfare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock unveiled the plans for the Covid-19 app, promising ""all data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research"". But immediately privacy campaigners, politicians and technology experts raised concerns. ""I recognise the overwhelming force of the public health arguments for a centralised system, but I also have 25 years' experience of the NHS being incompetent at developing systems and repeatedly breaking their privacy promises,"" said Cambridge University's Prof Ross Anderson.Yet the project was still gathering pace with the first trial of the app at RAF Leeming, in Yorkshire. The trial was held under artificial conditions, with servicemen and women placing phones adjacent to each other on tables to see what happened.Meanwhile, privacy-conscious Germany became the latest country to switch its app to the decentralised model, using the Apple and Google system. It seemed that Apple had made it clear that it would not cooperate with a centralised app.Michael Veale, a British academic working with a consortium developing decentralised apps, warned that the NHS app was on the wrong path, asking on Twitter ""will the UK push ahead with an app that will not work on iPhones - which has devastated adoption in Singapore?""But the UK pushed ahead with a trial in the Isle of Wight. As it got underway Mr Hancock told the public they had a ""duty"" to download the app when it became available and that it would be crucial in getting ""our liberty back"" as the lockdown was eased.First sight of the app showed it was very simple, asking users whether they had a fever or a continuous cough. But any symptom alerts sent out to contacts merely echoed the standard ""stay alert"" advice - test results couldn't be entered into the app at this stage. It left many residents confused.Still, the fact that the app was quickly downloaded by more than half of the island's smartphone users saw the government branding the trial a success.Meanwhile, the Financial Times revealed that the government had hired a Swiss software developer to build a second app, using the Apple and Google technology. NHS insiders were quick to downplay the significance of this move - although one admitted ""Downing Street is getting nervous"".Work continued on a second, more sophisticated version of the original app, which was again going to be tested in the Isle of Wight before a national rollout - though the original deadline of mid-May had been missed.On 20 May, however, it became clear that the government's focus was switching to manual-contact tracing. The prime minister announced that a ""world beating"" tracing system would be in place by the beginning of June, though Number 10 stressed that the app's contribution to the system would come a bit later.As May drew to a close the boss of the wider test and trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, said the app would be the ""cherry on the cake"" of the project. It was no longer the cake itself.By early June, more deadlines for the national release of the app had come and gone. Three weeks into the Isle of Wight trial residents were getting restless, with very little information on how it was going or when an updated version of the app was coming.France launched its centralised Stop-Covid app, which had drawn heavy criticism from privacy campaigners, and digital minister Cedric O said 600,000 downloads in the first few hours was ""a good start"".On 4 June, Business Minister Nadhim Zadhawi was coaxed into saying the app should be ready by the end of the month, but that was the last firm deadline that would be promised.Singapore, which had continued to struggle to make its contact tracing app work, announced plans to give all citizens a wearable device in the hope that this would do a better job than a smartphone.On 14 June, Germany became the biggest country to launch a decentralised app on the Apple/Google platform. It quickly outstripped France in terms of downloads with something approaching 10% of the population installing it. By now the silence from the UK government about the NHS app was deafening. What was going on?Around lunchtime on 18 June all became clear. The BBC broke the story that the government was abandoning the centralised app and moving to something based on Google and Apple's technology. Despite all the spin, the Isle of Wight trial had highlighted a disastrous flaw in the app - it failed to detect 96% of contacts with Apple iPhones.The blame game has already begun. Mr Hancock and some of the scientists working with the NHS believe Apple should have been more cooperative. Technology experts and privacy campaigners say they warned months ago how this story would end.Apple says it did not know the UK was working on a ""hybrid"" version of the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app using tech it developed with Google.Meanwhile, there is scant proof from anywhere around the world that smartphone apps using Bluetooth are an effective method of contact tracing. Back in March, it seemed that the hugely powerful devices most of us carry with us might help us emerge from this health crisis. Now it looks as though a human being on the end of a phone is a far better option.",20 June 2020,technology
Apple's annual developer showcase overshadowed by app row,"Apple is facing mounting pressure over how it runs its app store ahead of its major global developers' conference, which starts on Monday.The firm has been accused of creating ""hostile"" policies within its fee structure, and is dealing with two EU competition probes announced this week.But it is also embroiled in a row with some of its own developers.That has now widened into a debate involving politicians and other major technology firms. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference often features new product announcements but is mainly an event for software developers working on Apple's platforms - some of whom are now voicing discontent about its pricing.The argument was ignited in part by an email app called Hey, created by developer David Heinemeier Hansson. It had an update rejected by the Apple app store early this week because it does not allow in-app purchases - from which Apple takes a 30% cut.Many developers do not offer in-app subscriptions to avoid that levy - or raise the price of in-app subscriptions for the end user.But not all apps are affected, Mr Hansson says. He pointed to email apps from Gmail and Microsoft's Outlook, which he says are treated differently, but which Apple would not discuss with him. Hey's annual subscription of $99 (£80) is available only directly from the company online, and the app does not tell users where to buy it - so the firm believed it was following all the rules, similar to other email apps.But Apple told him the app should never have been approved in the first place - and could be removed.""If we don't like the deal Apple is offering us - which is to either pay them 30% or get kicked out - what are we going to do about that? Where are we going to go?"" he told the BBC.""If you launch a new piece of software today, and you're not available on the iPhone, you're invisible.""The cry has now been taken up by others, including blogger John Gruber, whose blog, Daring Fireball, is widely read among Apple developers. He wrote that if Hey's issues were not a mistake, the decision was ""outrageous"".Such issues are behind an anti-competition probe announced by the EU this week, prompted by a complaint from Spotify. The Swedish firm also takes issue with Apple's approach to charging subscriptions and the cut it takes.The anti-competition probe, coinciding with the row over Hey's business model, has snowballed into a much bigger argument.Microsoft President Brad Smith entered the debate, saying that regulators on both sides of the Atlantic should have a ""focused conversation"" about app stores and the rules in place - though he did not mention Apple by name.Microsoft has itself been the subject of competition probes, hit with hefty fines over its dominant market position with Microsoft Windows and its web browser.But he said the restrictions and demands placed on developers today are far higher than anything that existed 20 years ago, at the height of Microsoft's software dominance.Facebook, meanwhile, told the New York Times that its Gaming app had been rejected from Apple's app store five times.Sources who spoke to the newspaper said it might be because the app offers simple games that do not have to be downloaded in the traditional way - through Apple's store.Even the chairman of the House antitrust committee - the group of politicians that deals with competition law in the United States - has voiced his concern.""Because of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents - highway robbery, basically - bullying people to pay 30% or denying access to their market,"" David Cicilline told The Verge.""It's crushing small developers who simply can't survive with those kinds of payments. If there were real competition in this marketplace, this wouldn't happen.""The committee has asked the heads of major tech companies - including Tim Cook at Apple - to attend a session about competition in the tech sector. Mr Cook, it is reported, has yet to agree to attend.But despite the international attention on Apple's policies, its head of marketing, Phil Schiller, told Techcrunch the company was not considering any changes to its rules.",19 June 2020,technology
Apple 'not told' about UK's latest app plans,"Apple says it did not know the UK was working on a ""hybrid"" version of the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app using tech it developed with Google.The firm took the unusual step of saying it was also unaware of an issue regarding distance-measuring, which was flagged by Health Secretary Matt Hancock in Thursday's daily briefing.Apple said it was ""difficult to understand"" the claims.Downing Street said the government had ""worked closely with Apple and Google"".In tests carried out in the UK, there were occasions when software tools developed by Apple and Google could not differentiate between a phone in a user's pocket 1m (3.3ft) away and a phone in a user's hand 3m (9.8ft) away.During the briefing, Mr Hancock said: ""Measuring distance is clearly mission critical to any contact-tracing app.""However, speaking to the Times, Apple said: ""It is difficult to understand what these claims are as they haven't spoken to us.""The firm also pointed out that the tech was already either in use or intended for use in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Ireland.The tech giant also expressed surprise that the UK was working on a new version of the contact-tracing app which incorporated the Apple-Google software tool.""We've agreed to join forces with Google and Apple, to bring the best bits of both systems together,"" Mr Hancock said.However, Apple said: ""We don't know what they mean by this hybrid model. They haven't spoken to us about it.""It told the BBC it had nothing further to add.On Friday, the Department of Health said the NHS's digital innovation unit had indeed discussed its ambitions with Apple.""NHSX has been working with Google and Apple extensively since their API [application programming interface ] was made available,"" it told the BBC.""Over the last few weeks, senior representatives from NHSX and Apple have had productive meetings to discuss both products and future direction.""There is a commitment between the teams to work together to improve the distance measurement technology, which is integral to have a fully functioning contract-tracing app.""Google said yesterday that it welcomed the government's announcement.A Downing Street spokesman said the government continued to work closely with both Apple and Google on the app, and had done so since development began.""We've agreed with them to take forward our work on estimating distance through the app that we've developed and work to incorporate that into their app,"" he said.Apple and Google have not created an app. What they have built is a software tool which enables contact-tracing apps to work more smoothly with both iPhones and Android devices, but which does not store any data centrally.The UK wanted to store the data as it argued it would be useful for scientists tracking the spread of Covid-19.Dr David Bonsall from Oxford University, who is an adviser to the NHS app developers, told the BBC the tech giant had made a choice not to support the UK's original model.""Ultimately, a decision was taken by Apple to not support the centralised system that had been in development by the UK from March, and six weeks before they announced their own system under a decentralised model,"" he said.""And that has got to be considered in our reflection on the situation that the UK now faces.""The now-abandoned NHS app was tested on the Isle of Wight where it was downloaded more than 50,000 times. However, it registered only about 4% of the iPhones that were nearby.Islanders have now been asked to delete it.It's not the first time the government has clashed with Apple over an app - in 2018 an app built to help EU citizens apply to remain in the UK after Brexit was also found to not work properly on iPhones.On that occasion Apple did eventually agree to make the necessary changes to its system.",19 June 2020,technology
