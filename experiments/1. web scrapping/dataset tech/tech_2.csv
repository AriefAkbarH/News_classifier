Coronavirus: Amazon to make face shields and sell at cost,"Amazon says it will produce hundreds of thousands of face shields for medics and sell them at cost price in the US.The internet giant said engineers from its drone and hardware divisions had been tasked with developing the product.At first, it will sell them to healthcare professionals, before making them available to all Amazon customers.Amazon is not the first major US firm to use its resources to produce personal protective equipment (PPE). Apple began sending face shields to hospitals in March. Space X, HP and Ford also used their manufacturing resources to make and donate face shields and other types of protective equipment. Amazon said that it had donated 10,000 face shields in the US and was ""on track"" to deliver a further 20,000. But its plan to sell them at low prices on its website will make them available to the general public, something other firms have not done. A look on Amazon's marketplace on Thursday showed face shields sold by independent sellers were priced between $12 (£9.80) and $35.Once Amazon makes its mask available to all its customers, it could drive the price down significantly. The online retail giant has faced criticism for undercutting the prices of independent retailers on its sites, but anti-trust experts say its efforts to help in this crisis will likely offset those concerns. ""People who are concerned about Amazon's predatory behaviour might be concert but more people will be happy Amazon is making sure these are lower cost at a time of crisis,"" said Michael Kades, director of markets and competition at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.The company said it based its designs on a face shield developed by a community of 3D printing enthusiasts in Washington. After making some changes, its designs had been approved by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).Engineers from Amazon's drone division specialising in hardware design created a new design within a week that improved the quality of the materials to allow them to be reusable and added an enhanced snap feature to keep the shield in-place to make them safer.The engineers also amended the geometry of the shields to reduce sharp edges that could snag clothing or hair, thinned the forehead band to reduce pressure on a person's forehead, and drastically improved print time making them quicker to manufacture.Amazon's Brad Porter wrote in a blog post: ""Because of the design innovations and the capabilities of our supply chain, we are confident we will be able to list them at a significantly lower price - almost a third of the cost - than all other reusable face shields currently available to frontline workers.""The internet giant is also making its designs - known as the origami design and brimmed design - open source so that the shields could be 3D printed by anyone. Both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the British Standards Institution (BSI) have warned that homemade and 3D printed face shields do not always protect healthcare workers' faces from exposure to the coronavirus. But the global shortage of PPE has led to an increasing number of frontline medical workers crafting homemade equipment.   Amazon did not say whether it would provide the masks to workers at its warehouse who have reported a lack of safety equipment during the coronavirus pandemic. ",14 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: A4-sized face shields 'too narrow' for PPE,"The British Standards Institution (BSI) says that A4-sized face shields do not always protect healthcare workers' faces from exposure to Covid-19.Faced with a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), many communities have started making their own to help frontline workers.These include 3D-printing and laser-cut designs.Some incorporate A4-sized acetate transparent paper, designed for overhead projectors, to make the visor.""People are trying to use materials that are readily available,"" said Nathan Shipley, PPE group certification manager at the BSI.""Using acetates from an overhead projector is a quick fix, but the width of the acetate screens isn't wide enough.""Some people say, 'any PPE is better than no PPE', but if you are wearing something you think will protect you and it won't, you are in more danger.""The BSI looks at three key areas when testing PPE face shields:It follows the European standard EN166, which determines the size of the face area that needs protection - although some women find that standard issue kit doesn't fit them.The BSI said it has approved 21 face shield designs so far and has received around 70 from various groups, including businesses, academic institutions and individuals. It aims to carry out tests within two or three days, and if a CE number is granted, signifying that it has passed European safety standards - it is for the duration of the pandemic, and not permanent.The Royal Mint and the University of Nottingham were the first to get regulatory approval.""We wanted to make sure we were providing something that was safe,"" said Professor Richard Hague at the university's Faculty of Engineering.Prof Hague said the process took around 10 days - because the original design also fell foul of the A4 width issue.The university is now in the process of delivering 5,000 face shields to the NHS in Nottingham.""This is not a hard thing to do - it's using a system we have to make a product that's needed,"" said Prof Hague.

France gives online firms one hour to pull 'terrorist' content,"Social media and other websites will have just one hour to delete offending content under a new law passed by France's parliament.The one-hour deadline applies to content that French authorities consider to be related to terrorism or child sexual abuse.Failing to act could result in fines of up to 4% of global revenue -  billions of euros for the largest online firms.But critics say the new law could restrict freedom of expression.The new rules apply to all websites, whether large or small. But there are concerns that only internet giants such as Facebook and Google actually have the resources to remove content as quickly as required.Digital rights group La Quadrature du Net said the requirement to take down content that the police considered ""terrorism"" in just one hour was impractical.""Except the big companies, nobody can afford to have a 24/7 watch to remove the content when requested,"" a spokesman for the group said. ""Hence, they will have to rely on censorship before receiving a request from the police.""That might be in the form of using an automatic system provided by the largest companies, giving them ""more power on what can exist on the web or not"".But there are also fears that such tech could be used against groups such as protesters.""Since 2015, we already had such a law that allowed the police to ask for the removal of some content if they deemed it to be terrorist... this has been used multiple times in France to censor political content,"" the spokesman said.""Giving the police such a power, without any control... is obviously for us an infringement on the freedom of speech.""France's new law reflects one proposed at the European Union level, where law-makers last year suggested a one-hour deadline for the removal of content.But that proposal proved controversial and is currently in limbo.France pushed ahead with its own version of the law despite the concerns in Europe.Under the new French law, content judged to be illegal - but not relating to terrorism or child sexual abuse - will have to be taken down within 24 hours of notification.That includes posts inciting hatred, violence, racism, and sexual harassment. Failure to remove content could attract a fine of up to €1.25m (£1.1m).

Coronavirus: False claims viewed by millions on YouTube,"More than a quarter of the most-viewed coronavirus videos on YouTube contain ""misleading or inaccurate information"", a study suggests.In total, the misleading videos had been viewed more than 62 million times.Among the false claims was the idea that pharmaceutical companies already have a coronavirus vaccine but are refusing to sell it.YouTube said it was committed to reducing the spread of harmful misinformation.The researchers suggested ""good quality, accurate information"" had been uploaded to YouTube by government bodies and health experts.But it said the videos were often difficult to understand and lacked the popular appeal of YouTube stars and vloggers.The study, published online by BMJ Global Health, looked at the most widely viewed coronavirus-related videos in English, as of 21 March.After excluding duplicate videos, videos longer than an hour and videos that did not include relevant audio or visual material, they were left with 69 to analyse.The videos were scored on whether they presented exclusively factual information about viral spread, coronavirus symptoms, prevention and potential treatments.Videos from government agencies scored significantly better than other sources, but were less widely viewed.Of the 19 videos found to include misinformation:The report recommends that governments and health authorities should collaborate with entertainment news sources and social media influencers to make appealing, factual content that is more widely viewed.YouTube said in a statement: ""We're committed to providing timely and helpful information at this critical time, including raising authoritative content, reducing the spread of harmful misinformation and showing information panels, using NHS and World Health Organization (WHO) data, to help combat misinformation.""We have clear policies that prohibit videos promoting medically unsubstantiated methods to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment, and we quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged to us. Now any content that disputes the existence or transmission of Covid-19, as described by the WHO and the NHS is in violation of YouTube policies. For borderline content that could misinform users in harmful ways, we reduce recommendations.""We'll continue to evaluate the impact of these videos on communities around the world.""by Marianna Spring, specialist disinformation and social media reporterIn recent weeks, there has been an increase in highly polished videos promoting conspiracy theories being shared on YouTube - and they prove very popular. So these findings - although concerning - are not surprising.The accurate information shared by trusted public health bodies on YouTube tends to be more complex. It can lack the popular appeal of the conspiracy videos, which give misleading explanations to worried people who are looking for quick answers, or someone to blame. That includes videos such as Plandemic, which was widely shared online last week.High-quality production values and interviews with supposed experts can make these videos very convincing. Often facts will be presented out of context and used to draw false conclusions.  And tackling this kind of content is a game of cat-and-mouse for social media sites. Once videos gain traction, even if they are removed, they continue to be uploaded repeatedly by other users.It is not just alternative outlets uploading misinformation either. Whether for views or clicks, the study suggests some mainstream media outlets are also guilty of spreading misleading information.",14 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: German contact-tracing app takes different path to NHS,"Germany's forthcoming coronavirus contact-tracing app will trigger alerts only if users test positive for Covid-19.That puts it at odds with the NHS app, which instead relies on users self-diagnosing via an on-screen questionnaire.UK health chiefs have said the questionnaire is a key reason they are pursuing a ""centralised"" design despite privacy campaigners' protests.Germany ditched that model in April.And on Wednesday Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be a ""much higher level of acceptance"" for a decentralised approach, which is designed to offer a higher degree of anonymity.Automated contact tracing uses smartphones to register when their owners are in close proximity for significant amounts of time.If someone is later found to have the virus, a warning can be sent to others they may have infected, telling them to get tested themselves and possibly go into quarantine.In the centralised model, the contact-matching happens on a remote computer server. And the UK's National Cyber Security Centre has said this will enable it to catch attackers trying to abuse the self-diagnosis system.By contrast, the decentralised version carries out the process on the phones themselves. And there is no central database that could be used to re-identify individuals and reveal with whom they had had spent time.BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said: ""The NHS is taking a big gamble in choosing to alert app users when they have been in contact with someone who has merely reported symptoms.""It could make the app fast and effective - or it could mean users become exasperated by a blizzard of false alarms.""Ms Merkel said SAP and Deutsche Telekom - which are co-developing Germany's app - were waiting for Google and Apple to release a software interface before they could complete their work.And BBC News has learned the two US technology companies plan to release the finished version of their API (application programming interface) as soon as Thursday.Details of Germany's Corona-Warn-App published on the code-sharing site Github say it depends solely on medical test results to ""avoid misuse"".Those who test positive will be given a verification code that must be entered into the app before it anonymously flags them as being a risk to others.Germany has led the way in testing in Europe and currently has capacity to analyse about 838,000 samples per week. The UK is catching up - but scientists advising the NHS say they can save more lives by also drawing on self-diagnosis data.""Speed is of the essence,"" Prof Christophe Fraser, of the Oxford Big Data Institute, said last week.It can take several days to obtain Covid-19 test results.And self-reported symptoms can be acted on instantly.But an ethics advisory board advising Health Secretary Matt Hancock on the app has warned too many resulting ""false positive alerts could undermine trust in the app and cause undue stress to users"".The NHS is currently trialling its app on the Isle of Wight.There have been reports of some suspected false alerts.But a Department of Health spokeswoman said this had been expected.""In a matter of days, more than 50,000 people have downloaded the app with overwhelmingly positive feedback,"" she told BBC News.""But as with all new technologies, there will be issues that need to be resolved in how it works, which is why it is being trialled before a national rollout.""The NHS is also exploring use of the Apple-Google API, which would entail a switch to the decentralised model.But it intends to offer users the centralised version first, unless plans to complete the rollout within a fortnight go awry.One sticking point could be calls for limits on how the data is used - possibly requiring a new law.That would avoid the risk of a repeat of the situation in Norway, where the local data protection watchdog has accused the country's health authority of failing to carry out a proper risk assessment of a centralised contact-tracing app.",13 May 2020,technology

Coronavirus: German contact-tracing app takes different path to NHS,"Germany's forthcoming coronavirus contact-tracing app will trigger alerts only if users test positive for Covid-19.That puts it at odds with the NHS app, which instead relies on users self-diagnosing via an on-screen questionnaire.UK health chiefs have said the questionnaire is a key reason they are pursuing a ""centralised"" design despite privacy campaigners' protests.Germany ditched that model in April.And on Wednesday Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be a ""much higher level of acceptance"" for a decentralised approach, which is designed to offer a higher degree of anonymity.Automated contact tracing uses smartphones to register when their owners are in close proximity for significant amounts of time.If someone is later found to have the virus, a warning can be sent to others they may have infected, telling them to get tested themselves and possibly go into quarantine.In the centralised model, the contact-matching happens on a remote computer server. And the UK's National Cyber Security Centre has said this will enable it to catch attackers trying to abuse the self-diagnosis system.By contrast, the decentralised version carries out the process on the phones themselves. And there is no central database that could be used to re-identify individuals and reveal with whom they had had spent time.BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said: ""The NHS is taking a big gamble in choosing to alert app users when they have been in contact with someone who has merely reported symptoms.""It could make the app fast and effective - or it could mean users become exasperated by a blizzard of false alarms.""Ms Merkel said SAP and Deutsche Telekom - which are co-developing Germany's app - were waiting for Google and Apple to release a software interface before they could complete their work.And BBC News has learned the two US technology companies plan to release the finished version of their API (application programming interface) as soon as Thursday.Details of Germany's Corona-Warn-App published on the code-sharing site Github say it depends solely on medical test results to ""avoid misuse"".Those who test positive will be given a verification code that must be entered into the app before it anonymously flags them as being a risk to others.Germany has led the way in testing in Europe and currently has capacity to analyse about 838,000 samples per week.

France gives online firms one hour to pull 'terrorist' content,"Social media and other websites will have just one hour to delete offending content under a new law passed by France's parliament.The one-hour deadline applies to content that French authorities consider to be related to terrorism or child sexual abuse.Failing to act could result in fines of up to 4% of global revenue -  billions of euros for the largest online firms.But critics say the new law could restrict freedom of expression.The new rules apply to all websites, whether large or small. But there are concerns that only internet giants such as Facebook and Google actually have the resources to remove content as quickly as required.Digital rights group La Quadrature du Net said the requirement to take down content that the police considered ""terrorism"" in just one hour was impractical.""Except the big companies, nobody can afford to have a 24/7 watch to remove the content when requested,"" a spokesman for the group said. ""Hence, they will have to rely on censorship before receiving a request from the police.""That might be in the form of using an automatic system provided by the largest companies, giving them ""more power on what can exist on the web or not"".But there are also fears that such tech could be used against groups such as protesters.""Since 2015, we already had such a law that allowed the police to ask for the removal of some content if they deemed it to be terrorist... this has been used multiple times in France to censor political content,"" the spokesman said.""Giving the police such a power, without any control... is obviously for us an infringement on the freedom of speech.""France's new law reflects one proposed at the European Union level, where law-makers last year suggested a one-hour deadline for the removal of content.But that proposal proved controversial and is currently in limbo.France pushed ahead with its own version of the law despite the concerns in Europe.Under the new French law, content judged to be illegal - but not relating to terrorism or child sexual abuse - will have to be taken down within 24 hours of notification.That includes posts inciting hatred, violence, racism, and sexual harassment.

Inflatable e-scooter that fits in backpack unveiled,"An inflatable e-scooter compact enough to be stored inside a commuter's backpack has been unveiled in Japan. The Poimo, developed by the University of Tokyo, can be inflated in just over a minute, using an electric pump. The creators said they wanted to create a vehicle that minimised the potential for injury in the event of an accident. However, experts say e-scooter rules still need to be clarified by the government before such modes of transport can be considered safe. The Poimo has five solid, detachable components:It is made primarily out of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), which is already used to make products such as airbeds. The vehicle weighs about 5.5kg (12lb) in total.But researchers hope to reduce this for subsequent prototypes. ""We believe that our inflatable mobility, which is different from existing mobility systems and creates new relationships with people, will be useful for the city in the future,"" said Ryuma Niiyama, part of the development team at the University of Tokyo.Californian company Bird launched a pilot service in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in 2018.But e-scooters are currently banned on UK roads. That could change next month, though, following an urgent government review of the legislation.Ollie Chadwhick, managing director at e-scooter-maker Electra-Zoom, said: ""We have written to the Transport Minister, Grant Shapps, asking him to expedite this legislation, so that people can revolutionise the way they travel, in tandem with the return to work and the arrival of summer, without the risks of overcrowded public transport or reliance on cars.""Media manager Sam Jones told BBC News: “Cycling UK believes they should be legalised but cautiously, keeping them off pavements and carefully limiting the maximum speed and power of their electric motors,"" Mr Jones . ""Cautious legislation can be relaxed if this proves to be justified. ""However, we can’t do the opposite and restrict faster or higher-powered e-scooters once people are already using them.""

UK average broadband speeds up despite lockdown wobble,"The average broadband speed in the UK rose by 18% last year, regulator Ofcom says.The annual home broadband report says the average home speed is now 64 megabits per second (Mbps), up from 54.2Mbps the year before.The 18% boost is in line with growth in previous years.Data for the report was gathered in November 2019, but updated with changes during the coronavirus lockdown, when speeds fell by 2%.Ofcom says the small decrease shows that performance ""is holding up well"" during the pandemic, despite the increased demand.The government began to ask people to stay at home on 16 March, so the speeds from the last week of March were compared to the beginning of the month.Virgin Media was the worst affected, with speed dipping by nearly 10% at one point - although the report noted that since Virgin has higher speeds than most providers, customers were unlikely to have noticed.The Ofcom report is compiled from a panel of volunteers who have the speeds measured from their routers, and is considered to be a very accurate way of measuring the data.The main body of the report, which covers the data from 2019, found that nearly three-quarters of UK homes have what Ofcom considers ""superfast"" broadband packages of 30Mpbs or higher.Real-world connection speeds are slightly lower, with 69% of people achieving 30Mbps or more. That includes the 17% of homes on 100Mbps or higher, and 3% achieve more than 300Mbps. On the lower end, 13% of homes are still on connections of 10mbps or less, and another 18% have speeds between 10-30mbps.Real-world speeds measured at router, %Those numbers all refer to the proportion of people who are actually getting those speeds - not how widely available they are. The speeds and packages available to homes still depend on their physical address. Rural broadband, for example, broadly remains slower than the same technology in urban areas. Old-style ADSL (Asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections over copper wire, for example, are 36% higher in cities than outside them. But the gap between rural and urban connections is narrowing, the report found.Ofcom also launched a separate report on the same day on broadband availability - what is offered to homes, rather than what speeds are actually achieved.Full-fibre broadband is up by a fifth since last year, but is still only accessible to 12% of homes. Ultrafast broadband availability (300mpbs or higher) crept upward by 2% to 55% of households.",13 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus contact-tracing: World split between two types of app,"Countries around the world are developing Covid-19 smartphone apps to limit the spread of coronavirus and relax lockdown restrictions. It's hoped the information they gather can be used to alert people whether they pose a risk of spreading the contagion, and need to isolate. But, over recent weeks, a split has emerged between two different types of app - the so-called centralised and decentralised versions.Both types use Bluetooth signals to log when smartphone owners are close to each other - so if someone develops Covid-19 symptoms, an alert can be sent to other users they may have infected.Under the centralised model, the anonymised data gathered is uploaded to a remote server where matches are made with other contacts, should a person start to develop Covid-19 symptoms.This is the method the UK is pursuing. By contrast, the decentralised model gives users more control over their information by keeping it on the phone. It is there that matches are made with people who may have contracted the virus. This is the model promoted by Google, Apple and an international consortium.Both sides have their fans. Backers of the centralised model say it can give the authorities more insight into the spread of the virus and how well the app is performing. Supporters of the decentralised approach say it offers users a higher degree of privacy, protecting them from hackers or the state itself revealing their social contacts.In truth, both are unproven at this stage. South Korea, seen as one of the most successful countries at tackling Covid-19, has done it without a contact-tracing app. It has however used other surveillance methods which would be seen as invasive by many.At the start, the centralised approach was seen to be pioneering. Singapore's TraceTogether was widely viewed as the one to emulate. But that changed after it emerged the app was only being used by about 20% of the local population, and there had been a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.Part of the problem is that TraceTogether does not work properly when in the background on iPhones because of the way Apple restricts use of Bluetooth. The firm has promised to waive these curbs, but only if apps fall into line with its decentralised system. Singapore has since signalled it will do so as a result.""We are working with Apple and Google to make the app more effective, especially for iOS users,"" a spokesman told the BBC.Australia, another early adopter of the centralised approach, launched its CovidSafe app based on TraceTogether, and faced similar issues as a consequence. It has said it plans to adopt the Apple-Google framework, citing a ""big shift in performance of Bluetooth connectivity"". And on Wednesday, Colombia confirmed it too was considering a switch after having to turn off the contact-tracing feature in its CoronApp.""[We need to] minimise the risk of generating unnecessary alerts,"" said presidential advisor Victor Munoz.Others, though, are still forging ahead with the centralised approach. France's digital minister has said it intends to launch its StopCovid app by 2 June, and is attempting to press Apple into a U-turn of its own.""Apple could have helped us make the application work even better on the iPhone,"" said digital minister Cédric O on Tuesday. ""They have wished not to do so. I regret this.""But he faces internal resistance from one of the government's own human rights bodies, which has described the design as being ""dangerous"" and warned it may try to block its adoption.Norway has already adopted a centralised design for its Smittestopp app, which went live last month in three municipalities. In addition to Bluetooth readings, it also collects GPS location data.The developer claims that the combination of the two leads to ""very accurate contact tracing results without the need for [the Google-Apple interface"".But this has raised privacy concerns, which may have contributed to a fairly high drop-out rate. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said that as of 28 April, 1.5 million people had downloaded the app, but only 899,142 were actively using it - representing just 20.5% of over-16s in the test zones.India's contact-tracing app, Aaroya Setu, takes a similar approach to Norway's. To tackle adoption, the government has ruled all government and private sector workers must use it.Until Apple and Google release their interface, known as an API, it's impossible to be sure their system will be any more successful. But the list of nations flocking to it keeps growing. Germany surprised many when it confirmed it had been convinced decentralisation was the way to go - it had previously seemed set to go hand-in-hand with France.Poland's forthcoming app may also be about to abandon its centralised plan before launch.""We assume that adapting ProteGo Safe to Google and Apple APIs will be necessary,"" developers' notes read. ""We assume that adapting… to Google and Apple APIs will be necessary.""Italy's Immuni announced it too was backing the US tech giants' initiative on 29 April, praising its stronger guarantee of anonymity. Other countries set to do likewise include:Luxembourg's MPs are about to vote on a decentralised approach. And the BBC has also been told Greece is about to adopt a similar position.Why does all this matter? There may be problems trying to make the two different types of system talk to each other.""The core reason is that centralised systems ask you to upload the people you have seen, and decentralised systems don't need that data, so they don't play well together,"" explained Dr Michael Veale of the DP3T group, which supports a similar system to Apple and Google.""So if you see an app as an important part of reducing lockdown, then you remove the ability to trace the virus as it crosses borders, and viruses don't respect borders.""",7 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Will offices be safe for a return to work?,"As lockdowns start to ease in many countries, so the tentative return to work begins, leaving people understandably concerned about how safe a space an office will be in the middle of a global pandemic.Alongside some mouldy old food in the communal fridges, there is likely to be an increase in the amount of technology used to monitor employees.From thermal cameras taking your temperature when you enter the building to apps or wearables to alert you if you get too close to colleagues, work could soon have the feel of the Minority Report movie.The Edge in Amsterdam was voted one of the smartest and most sustainable buildings in the world a few years ago, and it is adapting its sensor-packed offices to the new reality of living with a contagious and potentially life-threatening virus.Coen van Oostrom, the founder of the real-estate firm that built it, told the BBC that there are a couple of ""no brainer"" changes that can happen immediately.""The doors can currently be opened by hand but it is a small step to be able to open them by voice control or via an app, and we want to do that to make sure the virus isn't spreading that way.""We also have cameras that can see how many people are on a floor and with a software update they are also able to measure how far people are away from each other, and we can send a warning to people's phones if they are too close to each other.""Not everyone likes it and there is a feeling that it is an intrusion on their privacy, so we haven't decided yet if we want to use it when everyone is back in the office.""The Edge, unlike most buildings, already provides employees with a phone app that allows them to see what temperature the office is and what air quality is like, as well as allowing them to order their lunch from the canteen.Take-up hasn't been huge. While in the past no one really cared about air quality, now that the chances of the virus spreading are higher if not enough fresh air is circulating, people might start taking notice of it, thinks Mr van Oostrom.Seating plans will also have to change to make sure social distancing rules can be enforced but Susan Clarke, a smart buildings expert with research firm Verdantix, thinks employers are unlikely to radically alter their working practices.""Hot-desking will remain and given the recession we are moving into right now, most firms won't be able to take on more space - but it might be re-thought, so as one person checks out of a desk, a work order is assigned to that area so a cleaner can do some disinfecting.""Some lighting firms, such as Vital Vio, are offering what they describe as safe disinfection lighting, which uses violet light mixed with white light to kill some bacteria on surfaces. While these might have a use in hotels or very high occupancy offices, the expense may not be justifiable to many businesses, thinks Ms Clarke.Flir Technology has been making thermal cameras for use in airports and on board police helicopters for years, but has seen exponential growth in the last few months.Now the firm is seeing interest from factories and businesses.""Basically, every industry that needs to protect its workers and its customers,"" said Flir's vice president of marketing for Flir, Ezra Merrill.The cameras measure a five millimetre square area near the tear duct, which has been judged the best place to record skin temperature. Users wearing spectacles have to remove them.Its algorithms take account of a range of factors, such as time of day, whether it is sunny or raining, as well as the fact that people have a range of normal body temperature.But the device is just one part of the puzzle, and a second step would be to take a person's temperature using a medical grade thermometer, said Mr Merrill.The technology was recently tested at a US factory, where reaction from employees was mixed.""It was a full range as you'd expect, from people who were excited and happy to do it to those who thought they were getting a retina scan.""In fact the camera does not take a picture at all and it is not possible to identify people from the image, but Mr Merrill acknowledges there could be privacy issues. And in some places it could be illegal.""Some countries prohibit employee health monitoring. In Italy for example there are laws stating that you can't monitor health, and that includes parameters such as temperature,"" said Ms Clarke.Lawyer Ravi Naik said businesses have to be careful they are not using ""tech for tech's sake"".""Is this to facilitate an understanding of who can work and who can't, and if not what is the significance of it? Because it is such an interference with basic human rights that there has to be a high level of evidential justification to deploy this tech, and I just don't think that is the case right now.""The radical, long-term solution might involve not having to go into a building at all.Barclays Bank's chief executive Jes Staley has said that having thousands of workers in big expensive city offices ""may be a thing of the past"" as the home-working lockdown era proves many can do their jobs perfectly well at home.As a real estate developer, Mr van Oostrom obviously disagrees.He thinks we will see a hybrid model with more people working from home and employers having ""to seduce people to come into the office"". ""Making offices fun places to be will be more important than ever,"" he said.",7 May 2020,technology

Coronavirus: Amazon to make face shields and sell at cost,"Amazon says it will produce hundreds of thousands of face shields for medics and sell them at cost price in the US.The internet giant said engineers from its drone and hardware divisions had been tasked with developing the product.At first, it will sell them to healthcare professionals, before making them available to all Amazon customers.Amazon is not the first major US firm to use its resources to produce personal protective equipment (PPE). Apple began sending face shields to hospitals in March. Space X, HP and Ford also used their manufacturing resources to make and donate face shields and other types of protective equipment. Amazon said that it had donated 10,000 face shields in the US and was ""on track"" to deliver a further 20,000. But its plan to sell them at low prices on its website will make them available to the general public, something other firms have not done. A look on Amazon's marketplace on Thursday showed face shields sold by independent sellers were priced between $12 (£9.80) and $35.Once Amazon makes its mask available to all its customers, it could drive the price down significantly. The online retail giant has faced criticism for undercutting the prices of independent retailers on its sites, but anti-trust experts say its efforts to help in this crisis will likely offset those concerns. ""People who are concerned about Amazon's predatory behaviour might be concert but more people will be happy Amazon is making sure these are lower cost at a time of crisis,"" said Michael Kades, director of markets and competition at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.The company said it based its designs on a face shield developed by a community of 3D printing enthusiasts in Washington. After making some changes, its designs had been approved by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).Engineers from Amazon's drone division specialising in hardware design created a new design within a week that improved the quality of the materials to allow them to be reusable and added an enhanced snap feature to keep the shield in-place to make them safer.The engineers also amended the geometry of the shields to reduce sharp edges that could snag clothing or hair, thinned the forehead band to reduce pressure on a person's forehead, and drastically improved print time making them quicker to manufacture.Amazon's Brad Porter wrote in a blog post: ""Because of the design innovations and the capabilities of our supply chain, we are confident we will be able to list them at a significantly lower price - almost a third of the cost - than all other reusable face shields currently available to frontline workers.""The internet giant is also making its designs - known as the origami design and brimmed design - open source so that the shields could be 3D printed by anyone. Both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the British Standards Institution (BSI) have warned that homemade and 3D printed face shields do not always protect healthcare workers' faces from exposure to the coronavirus. But the global shortage of PPE has led to an increasing number of frontline medical workers crafting homemade equipment.   Amazon did not say whether it would provide the masks to workers at its warehouse who have reported a lack of safety equipment during the coronavirus pandemic. ",14 May 2020,technology
France gives online firms one hour to pull 'terrorist' content,"Social media and other websites will have just one hour to delete offending content under a new law passed by France's parliament.The one-hour deadline applies to content that French authorities consider to be related to terrorism or child sexual abuse.Failing to act could result in fines of up to 4% of global revenue -  billions of euros for the largest online firms.But critics say the new law could restrict freedom of expression.The new rules apply to all websites, whether large or small. But there are concerns that only internet giants such as Facebook and Google actually have the resources to remove content as quickly as required.Digital rights group La Quadrature du Net said the requirement to take down content that the police considered ""terrorism"" in just one hour was impractical.""Except the big companies, nobody can afford to have a 24/7 watch to remove the content when requested,"" a spokesman for the group said. ""Hence, they will have to rely on censorship before receiving a request from the police.""That might be in the form of using an automatic system provided by the largest companies, giving them ""more power on what can exist on the web or not"".But there are also fears that such tech could be used against groups such as protesters.""Since 2015, we already had such a law that allowed the police to ask for the removal of some content if they deemed it to be terrorist... this has been used multiple times in France to censor political content,"" the spokesman said.""Giving the police such a power, without any control... is obviously for us an infringement on the freedom of speech.""France's new law reflects one proposed at the European Union level, where law-makers last year suggested a one-hour deadline for the removal of content.But that proposal proved controversial and is currently in limbo.France pushed ahead with its own version of the law despite the concerns in Europe.Under the new French law, content judged to be illegal - but not relating to terrorism or child sexual abuse - will have to be taken down within 24 hours of notification.That includes posts inciting hatred, violence, racism, and sexual harassment. Failure to remove content could attract a fine of up to €1.25m (£1.1m). France's regulator, the Superior Council of the Audiovisual (CSA), will have the power to impose heftier fines of up to 4% of global turnover for continuous and repeated violations.Laetitia Avia, the MP from President Macron's LREM party who proposed the bill, said the law would protect victims, while reaffirming the country's commitment to freedom of expression.However, France's Republicans party voted against the measure.Member Constance Le Grip told the National Assembly that fighting online hatred could not come at the expense of freedom of expression. Her colleague in the Senate Bruno Retailleau tweeted that the new law was ""incompatible with respect for public freedoms"".Facebook said it was working closely with French regulator CSA and others ""on the implementation of this law"".YouTube said it already tackled illegal content and welcomed any new partnership with governments.Twitter's head of public affairs in France, Audrey Herblin-Stoop, told Reuters that the company would continue to work with the government to fight illegal content and hate speech.",14 May 2020,technology
