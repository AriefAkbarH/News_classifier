Pulling apart a £339 anti-5G USB stick,"A device costing more than £300 promises to protect your family from the supposed dangers of 5G, using ground-breaking quantum technology - but does it work? Of course not.The rollout of the new 5G mobile networks began in the UK only last summer and has not yet reached outside urban areas. Yet across the country there is already a cottage industry offering protection against the supposed negative health effects, even though they have been dismissed by regulators and mainstream scientists.The 5GBioShield was recommended by a member of Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee, which has called for an inquiry into 5G. One of nine external members, Toby Hall, said: ""We use this device and find it helpful,"" and provided a link to its website, which describes it as a USB key that ""provides protection for  your home and family, thanks to the wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser, which can be worn or placed near to a smartphone or any other electrical, radiation or EMF [electromagnetic field] emitting device"".""Through a process of quantum oscillation, the 5GBioShield USB key balances and re-harmonises the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wi-fi, tablets, et cetera,"" it adds.Each of these USB keys costs £339.60 including VAT, though there is a special offer of three for £958.80.But, at first sight, it seems to be just that - a USB key, with just 128MB of storage.""So what's different between it and a virtually identical 'crystal' USB key available from various suppliers in Shenzhen, China, for around £5 per key?"" asks Ken Munro, whose company, Pen Test Partners, specialises in taking apart consumer electronic products to spot security vulnerabilities.And the answer appears to be a circular sticker. ""Now, we're not 5G quantum experts but said sticker looks remarkably like one available in sheets from stationery suppliers for less than a penny each,"" he says.Mr Munro and his colleague Phil Eveleigh proceeded to dismantle the USB key to find out if there were any whizz-bang electronics inside. But all they found was an LED light on the circuit board, similar to those on any other USB key.They concluded that trading standards bodies should now carry out their own investigations. London Trading Standards has since told the BBC it has launched a probe.A search in Companies House shows the two directors of BioShield Distribution are Anna Grochowalska and Valerio Laghezza. Both of them appear to have been involved previously in a business called Immortalis, which sells a dietary supplement called Klotho Formula. Its website - rather similar in design to that of the BioShield - says Klotho Formula uses a ""proprietary procedure that leads to relativistic time dilation and biological quantum entanglement at the DNA level"".Ms Grochowalska told BBC News her company was the sole global distributor of the 5GBioShield -  but it did not manufacture or own the product. ""We are in possession of a great deal of technical information, with plenty of back-up historical research,"" she said.""As you can understand, we are not authorised to fully disclose all this sensitive information to third parties, for obvious reasons.""And she rejected the suggestion selling a £5 product for more than £300 was unreasonable.""In regard to the costs analysis your research has produced, I believe that the lack of in-depth information will not drive you to the exact computation of our expenses and production costs, including the cost of IP [intellectual property rights], and so on,"" she said.""It is therefore hard to take your evaluation seriously, since you have evidently not researched the background facts in any meaningful way.""Mr Hall said his remarks in Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee report should not be seen as a recommendation to buy the product.But he had no regrets about buying it and since plugging it in had felt beneficial effects, including being able to sleep through the night and having more dreams. ""I also felt a 'calmer' feel to the home,"" he told BBC News.And he had thought the company might be able to develop a system that could offer protection to the whole town of Glastonbury against the effects of radiation from electromagnetic fields.It's worth noting though that the regulator Ofcom has published the results of EMF measurements at 16 sites, which were taken following the launch of 5G. It said that in each case, emissions were ""a small fraction"" of the levels deemed safe under international guidelines.",28 May 2020,technology
Glastonbury 5G report 'hijacked by conspiracy theorists',"Last month, the town council of Glastonbury in Somerset published a report calling for a government inquiry into the safety of 5G.It promised to oppose the rollout of the next-generation mobile networks in the town. Now, three members of the group that produced the report have told the BBC they resigned because it was taken over by anti-5G activists and ""spiritual healers"".They fear it could lend credibility to conspiracy theories, such as 5G being linked to the spread of coronavirus.""The whole thing was completely biased from the beginning,"" says Mark Swann, one of those who resigned. ""Genuine scientific expertise has been scorned in favour of conspiracy and hearsay,"" wrote David Swain in his letter of resignation. 5G is the next generation of mobile phone technology. It promises faster downloads and increased capacity.The radio waves involved in 5G  - and the previous generation networks - sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not energetic enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum, which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays.Get the facts: BBC Reality CheckThe report, published after a six-month inquiry, said the council would oppose the rollout of 5G, while accepting it had no power to halt it.Glastonbury's 5G Advisory Committee was made up of nine councillors, and nine local residents who responded to adverts calling for people with relevant experience to help decide whether 5G was safe.Among the volunteers were:All four ended up resigning before the report was completed.""I joined the working group in good faith, expecting to take part in a sensible discussion about 5G,"" says Mr Swann. ""Sadly the whole thing turned out to be a clueless pantomime driven by conspiracy theorists and sceptics."" Mr Cooper reached the same conclusion: ""I worked out there were only four of us who were neutral. And the others were all absolutely against 5G, either strongly or weakly.""Most of the evidence the committee heard was from witnesses who had stated their support for a moratorium on the rollout of 5G. They included retired American professor Martin Pall, who in 2019 claimed that wireless networks would make all human beings sterile if they were not switched off within two years. Another witness was Dr Andrew Tresidder, a former GP whose website offers flower remedies and emotional healing. His presentation focused on people claiming to suffer from ""electromagnetic stress"", which he said was often not taken seriously by mainstream doctors.Committee member Roy Procter, a spiritual healer who claims dowsing can heal ""sick houses"", also gave a presentation. In the report, he speculates about a link between the coronavirus and 5G, and recommends that the council eliminate all wi-fi connections.The committee's chairman, Councillor Jon Cousins, told the BBC he strongly disagrees with the suggestion that the meetings were biased towards pseudo-science. ""Equal weight was given to all contributions,"" he says, adding that councillors ""were able to take into account the prejudice, predetermination and bias displayed on all sides of the argument"".In the report, Mr Cousins said Glastonbury had punched above its weight, and other councils had been in touch about its recommendations.But both Mr Swann and Mr Cooper were particularly concerned about the role of an external member of the committee. Christopher Baker was instrumental in choosing witnesses to appear before the committee. He also gave his own presentation in which he attacked the credibility of ICNIRP, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, the body which sets the safety standards for mobile network emissions.Mr Baker has campaigned against 5G across the south-west. Before the committee was formed, he had been lobbying Glastonbury councillors to ban the technology. In a Facebook post in May 2019, he outlined his campaigning activities and bemoaned the lack of support from residents.""The only thing that is missing is the support from the community! I can't do this for you on my own, this is about you and for you,"" he said.But in a YouTube video posted in July, he tells another anti-5G activist how he helped convince Glastonbury Town Council to get the investigation underway. He encouraged others to organise local petitions.He has also appeared in videos alongside Mark Steele, another anti-5G conspiracy theorist. Mr Steele claims the coronavirus is a hoax, and has posted videos of himself harassing telecoms engineers. Mr Cooper says the committee was supposed to be made up of people who lived in the area or had a business there. He complained that Christopher Baker did not meet those requirements because he lived in Hampshire, which does not even border Somerset.He resigned after the complaint was ignored, describing Mr Baker as a ""semi-professional anti-5G activist"". He highlighted a video in which Mr Baker admitted some of his fuel costs were paid by a benefactor.Mr Baker told the BBC it was true that he lived in Hampshire, but said he had long-term connections to Glastonbury, and in any case other members of the committee were from outside the town. He admitted that he did receive some funding from a benefactor he refused to name. ""I don't have a lot of money, and if I travel half-way up the country to give a presentation, the least I expect is someone to contribute something towards my fuel bill.""He said those who resigned from the committee were dismissive of the evidence, rude to witnesses such as Prof Pall, and a disruptive force at the meetings. Committee chair Jon Cousins agreed: ""Some of the behaviours displayed by non-councillor members when they could not debate by 'reason' broke Glastonbury Town Council's code of conduct.""This is strongly denied by Mark Swann and his colleagues.The committee did hear evidence from Mobile UK, the mobile operators' trade body. Its presentation was criticised by one member for being ""glossy"", and others alleged there was no attempt to answer questions. Gareth Elliott of Mobile UK denied that: ""We answered everything that was asked of us."" However, he said it was a cordial meeting and his organisation respected the views of the committee.He recounts an incident where one committee member arrived late to a meeting. She said that although she was hyper-sensitive to electromagnetic emissions, she deemed the meeting room to be safe. ""It was then noted that a wi-fi router was operating and was in the room,"" he says.Those who resigned from the committee say they are concerned about the reputation of Glastonbury. Last month, Piers Corbyn - the brother of the former Labour leader - led an anti-lockdown protest in the town, where slogans against 5G were shouted. Mr Swann says the atmosphere in the town has been tense lately and he is worried about the impact of the 5G report.""This fallacious report severely damages Glastonbury's credibility,"" he says. ""It undermines years of good work by well-meaning councillors and leaves a dark shadow over the town's  reputation.""But Councillor Jon Cousins rejects the idea that the report may have served to encourage the conspiracy theorists. ""Glastonbury Town Council's position and resolutions around 5G do not - and have never - suggested a link between 5G and Covid-19 or indeed that coronavirus is a hoax."" He says the council worked closely with Avon and Somerset Police to deal with last month's demonstration and breaches of social distancing legislation.",16 May 2020,technology

Uber destroys thousands of bikes and scooters,"Uber is destroying thousands of electric bikes and scooters, after selling its Jump business to Lime.Videos of its red bikes being crushed at a recycling centre were shared on social media, angering cycling advocates.Uber said it had decided to destroy thousands of its older-model vehicles due to maintenance, liability and safety concerns.In the UK, Uber continues to operate Jump and has not scrapped any bikes.A spokesman told the BBC the sale of Jump to Lime had not been completed in Europe, and that Jump continued to operate ""as normal"" in London.In 2018, Uber said it would focus more on its electric bike and scooter business than on cars.But on 7 May this year, Uber announced a deal that saw Lime take over the Jump bike business.As part of the deal, Uber invested $170m (£139m) in Lime, while Lime acquired ""tens of thousands"" of Uber's Jump bikes - and the associated intellectual property.Lime's chief executive Wayne Ting has said he prefers the design of Uber's bikes and will deploy more of them in the future.However, there were also ""tens of thousands"" of older-model bikes that Lime did not inherit as part of the deal.Videos shared on Twitter show the bikes arriving at a recycling facility in North Carolina to be destroyed.Disappointed charities and organisations suggested the bikes could have been donated to community groups, or sold to individuals to boost the uptake of electric bikes.""Why not at least peel the decals [branding] off and sell the bikes to individuals?"" Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, a non-profit group, told news site Motherboard.""We explored donating the remaining, older-model bikes,"" Uber said in a statement.""But given many significant issues - including maintenance, liability, safety concerns, and a lack of consumer-grade charging equipment - we decided the best approach was to responsibly recycle them.""",28 May 2020,technology
Twitter fact-checks China amid bias row,"Twitter, under intense scrutiny for its use of fact-checking warnings, has added them to tweets from China's foreign ministry spokesperson.The warning has been added to tweets from spokesman Lijian Zhao, in which he warned: ""It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.""Twitter added the warning more than two months after the tweets were posted.It comes amid a row with the White House, after similar warnings were added to tweets from President Trump.Mr Trump is now poised to sign an executive order targeting social-media firms, the White House said, in a significant escalation of the dispute. Earlier this week, after Twitter added its fact-checking links to President Trump's tweets, he threatened to ""shut down"" social networks for alleged anti-conservative bias.The warnings on Lijian Zhao's tweets were added after the US developments.One tweet, from 12 March, criticised the US Centers for Disease Control for a lack of clarity before alleging that it ""might be"" that the US army was somehow involved in the Wuhan outbreak.In another tweet the following day, he linked to an article claiming to have evidence that the virus originated in the United States, encouraging people to read and retweet it - which thousands did.Both tweets now contains a bright blue exclamation mark urging readers to ""Get the facts about Covid-19"". Clicking it directs the user to a page of tweets about the World Health Organization's research that suggests the virus originated in animals, and downplays theories about deliberate human involvement in its spread.The New York Post, which broke the story, said Twitter had added the warning only after its reporters put pressure on the company over alleged ""double standards"" between the Chinese official and Mr Trump.A Twitter spokesperson would not confirm whether that was the case, saying only that Mr Zhao's tweets ""contain potentially misleading content about Covid-19"" and were labelled to ""provide additional context"".Twitter founder Jack Dorsey meanwhile, appealed to users to ""please leave our employees out of this"" as the row with the White House erupted.Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, has been blamed by many Conservatives as the man behind the effort to fact-check the president. Many prominent Republican voices on Twitter pointed to old tweets by Mr Roth which refer to ""Nazis in the White House"" and other insults about the president and his allies.Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House aide with the job title of counsellor to the president, appeared to encourage supporters to contact Mr Roth online, saying on Fox News that someone should ""go wake him up and tell him he's about to get more followers"". Twitter, however, insists that no one person is responsible for its fact-checking decisions.""There is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me,"" Mr Dorsey tweeted, promising to continue to ""point out incorrect or disputed information"".""Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.

Video streaming: Lockdown sees fifth of UK homes sign deals,"One in five households in Britain – six million – signed up to an online video subscription service during the Covid-19 lockdown, data suggests.The majority of those sign-ups, 52%, are going to Disney+, according to market research firm Kantar.The most-enjoyed piece of content, though, was Netflix’s exclusive documentary series Tiger King.AppleTV+ struggled to engage TV viewers, however, according to the research.Kantar’s data shows the tech giant’s TV service was popular on smartphone and tablet devices, but lagged behind competitors in terms of TV screen viewing.“It’s been a huge quarter for streaming in the UK. We can certainly associate a good deal of that with the current lockdown situation,” Dominic Sunnebo, senior vice president at Kantar, told the BBC.Mr Sunnebo also noted the instant popularity of Disney+, which only launched in the UK on 24 March.“Of people who are in the video streaming sector already, one in five now have a Disney+ streaming subscription,” he said. “It’s unheard of.”There are now, on average, 2.3 online video subscriptions per household in the UK.

Pulling apart a £339 anti-5G USB stick,"A device costing more than £300 promises to protect your family from the supposed dangers of 5G, using ground-breaking quantum technology - but does it work? Of course not.The rollout of the new 5G mobile networks began in the UK only last summer and has not yet reached outside urban areas. Yet across the country there is already a cottage industry offering protection against the supposed negative health effects, even though they have been dismissed by regulators and mainstream scientists.The 5GBioShield was recommended by a member of Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee, which has called for an inquiry into 5G. One of nine external members, Toby Hall, said: ""We use this device and find it helpful,"" and provided a link to its website, which describes it as a USB key that ""provides protection for  your home and family, thanks to the wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser, which can be worn or placed near to a smartphone or any other electrical, radiation or EMF [electromagnetic field] emitting device"".""Through a process of quantum oscillation, the 5GBioShield USB key balances and re-harmonises the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wi-fi, tablets, et cetera,"" it adds.Each of these USB keys costs £339.60 including VAT, though there is a special offer of three for £958.80.But, at first sight, it seems to be just that - a USB key, with just 128MB of storage.""So what's different between it and a virtually identical 'crystal' USB key available from various suppliers in Shenzhen, China, for around £5 per key?"" asks Ken Munro, whose company, Pen Test Partners, specialises in taking apart consumer electronic products to spot security vulnerabilities.And the answer appears to be a circular sticker. ""Now, we're not 5G quantum experts but said sticker looks remarkably like one available in sheets from stationery suppliers for less than a penny each,"" he says.Mr Munro and his colleague Phil Eveleigh proceeded to dismantle the USB key to find out if there were any whizz-bang electronics inside. But all they found was an LED light on the circuit board, similar to those on any other USB key.They concluded that trading standards bodies should now carry out their own investigations. London Trading Standards has since told the BBC it has launched a probe.A search in Companies House shows the two directors of BioShield Distribution are Anna Grochowalska and Valerio Laghezza. Both of them appear to have been involved previously in a business called Immortalis, which sells a dietary supplement called Klotho Formula. Its website - rather similar in design to that of the BioShield - says Klotho Formula uses a ""proprietary procedure that leads to relativistic time dilation and biological quantum entanglement at the DNA level"".Ms Grochowalska told BBC News her company was the sole global distributor of the 5GBioShield -  but it did not manufacture or own the product. ""We are in possession of a great deal of technical information, with plenty of back-up historical research,"" she said.""As you can understand, we are not authorised to fully disclose all this sensitive information to third parties, for obvious reasons.""And she rejected the suggestion selling a £5 product for more than £300 was unreasonable.""In regard to the costs analysis your research has produced, I believe that the lack of in-depth information will not drive you to the exact computation of our expenses and production costs, including the cost of IP [intellectual property rights], and so on,"" she said.""It is therefore hard to take your evaluation seriously, since you have evidently not researched the background facts in any meaningful way.""Mr Hall said his remarks in Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee report should not be seen as a recommendation to buy the product.But he had no regrets about buying it and since plugging it in had felt beneficial effects, including being able to sleep through the night and having more dreams. ""I also felt a 'calmer' feel to the home,"" he told BBC News.And he had thought the company might be able to develop a system that could offer protection to the whole town of Glastonbury against the effects of radiation from electromagnetic fields.It's worth noting though that the regulator Ofcom has published the results of EMF measurements at 16 sites, which were taken following the launch of 5G. It said that in each case, emissions were ""a small fraction"" of the levels deemed safe under international guidelines.",28 May 2020,technology
Glastonbury 5G report 'hijacked by conspiracy theorists',"Last month, the town council of Glastonbury in Somerset published a report calling for a government inquiry into the safety of 5G.It promised to oppose the rollout of the next-generation mobile networks in the town. Now, three members of the group that produced the report have told the BBC they resigned because it was taken over by anti-5G activists and ""spiritual healers"".They fear it could lend credibility to conspiracy theories, such as 5G being linked to the spread of coronavirus.""The whole thing was completely biased from the beginning,"" says Mark Swann, one of those who resigned. ""Genuine scientific expertise has been scorned in favour of conspiracy and hearsay,"" wrote David Swain in his letter of resignation. 5G is the next generation of mobile phone technology. It promises faster downloads and increased capacity.The radio waves involved in 5G  - and the previous generation networks - sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not energetic enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum, which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays.Get the facts: BBC Reality CheckThe report, published after a six-month inquiry, said the council would oppose the rollout of 5G, while accepting it had no power to halt it.Glastonbury's 5G Advisory Committee was made up of nine councillors, and nine local residents who responded to adverts calling for people with relevant experience to help decide whether 5G was safe.Among the volunteers were:All four ended up resigning before the report was completed.""I joined the working group in good faith, expecting to take part in a sensible discussion about 5G,"" says Mr Swann. ""Sadly the whole thing turned out to be a clueless pantomime driven by conspiracy theorists and sceptics."" Mr Cooper reached the same conclusion: ""I worked out there were only four of us who were neutral. And the others were all absolutely against 5G, either strongly or weakly.""Most of the evidence the committee heard was from witnesses who had stated their support for a moratorium on the rollout of 5G. They included retired American professor Martin Pall, who in 2019 claimed that wireless networks would make all human beings sterile if they were not switched off within two years. Another witness was Dr Andrew Tresidder, a former GP whose website offers flower remedies and emotional healing. His presentation focused on people claiming to suffer from ""electromagnetic stress"", which he said was often not taken seriously by mainstream doctors.Committee member Roy Procter, a spiritual healer who claims dowsing can heal ""sick houses"", also gave a presentation. In the report, he speculates about a link between the coronavirus and 5G, and recommends that the council eliminate all wi-fi connections.The committee's chairman, Councillor Jon Cousins, told the BBC he strongly disagrees with the suggestion that the meetings were biased towards pseudo-science. ""Equal weight was given to all contributions,"" he says, adding that councillors ""were able to take into account the prejudice, predetermination and bias displayed on all sides of the argument"".In the report, Mr Cousins said Glastonbury had punched above its weight, and other councils had been in touch about its recommendations.But both Mr Swann and Mr Cooper were particularly concerned about the role of an external member of the committee. Christopher Baker was instrumental in choosing witnesses to appear before the committee. He also gave his own presentation in which he attacked the credibility of ICNIRP, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, the body which sets the safety standards for mobile network emissions.Mr Baker has campaigned against 5G across the south-west. Before the committee was formed, he had been lobbying Glastonbury councillors to ban the technology. In a Facebook post in May 2019, he outlined his campaigning activities and bemoaned the lack of support from residents.""The only thing that is missing is the support from the community! I can't do this for you on my own, this is about you and for you,"" he said.But in a YouTube video posted in July, he tells another anti-5G activist how he helped convince Glastonbury Town Council to get the investigation underway. He encouraged others to organise local petitions.He has also appeared in videos alongside Mark Steele, another anti-5G conspiracy theorist. Mr Steele claims the coronavirus is a hoax, and has posted videos of himself harassing telecoms engineers. Mr Cooper says the committee was supposed to be made up of people who lived in the area or had a business there. He complained that Christopher Baker did not meet those requirements because he lived in Hampshire, which does not even border Somerset.He resigned after the complaint was ignored, describing Mr Baker as a ""semi-professional anti-5G activist"". He highlighted a video in which Mr Baker admitted some of his fuel costs were paid by a benefactor.Mr Baker told the BBC it was true that he lived in Hampshire, but said he had long-term connections to Glastonbury, and in any case other members of the committee were from outside the town. He admitted that he did receive some funding from a benefactor he refused to name. ""I don't have a lot of money, and if I travel half-way up the country to give a presentation, the least I expect is someone to contribute something towards my fuel bill.""He said those who resigned from the committee were dismissive of the evidence, rude to witnesses such as Prof Pall, and a disruptive force at the meetings. Committee chair Jon Cousins agreed: ""Some of the behaviours displayed by non-councillor members when they could not debate by 'reason' broke Glastonbury Town Council's code of conduct.""This is strongly denied by Mark Swann and his colleagues.The committee did hear evidence from Mobile UK, the mobile operators' trade body. Its presentation was criticised by one member for being ""glossy"", and others alleged there was no attempt to answer questions. Gareth Elliott of Mobile UK denied that: ""We answered everything that was asked of us."" However, he said it was a cordial meeting and his organisation respected the views of the committee.He recounts an incident where one committee member arrived late to a meeting. She said that although she was hyper-sensitive to electromagnetic emissions, she deemed the meeting room to be safe. ""It was then noted that a wi-fi router was operating and was in the room,"" he says.Those who resigned from the committee say they are concerned about the reputation of Glastonbury. Last month, Piers Corbyn - the brother of the former Labour leader - led an anti-lockdown protest in the town, where slogans against 5G were shouted. Mr Swann says the atmosphere in the town has been tense lately and he is worried about the impact of the 5G report.""This fallacious report severely damages Glastonbury's credibility,"" he says. ""It undermines years of good work by well-meaning councillors and leaves a dark shadow over the town's  reputation.""But Councillor Jon Cousins rejects the idea that the report may have served to encourage the conspiracy theorists. ""Glastonbury Town Council's position and resolutions around 5G do not - and have never - suggested a link between 5G and Covid-19 or indeed that coronavirus is a hoax.""

Uber destroys thousands of bikes and scooters,"Uber is destroying thousands of electric bikes and scooters, after selling its Jump business to Lime.Videos of its red bikes being crushed at a recycling centre were shared on social media, angering cycling advocates.Uber said it had decided to destroy thousands of its older-model vehicles due to maintenance, liability and safety concerns.In the UK, Uber continues to operate Jump and has not scrapped any bikes.A spokesman told the BBC the sale of Jump to Lime had not been completed in Europe, and that Jump continued to operate ""as normal"" in London.In 2018, Uber said it would focus more on its electric bike and scooter business than on cars.But on 7 May this year, Uber announced a deal that saw Lime take over the Jump bike business.As part of the deal, Uber invested $170m (£139m) in Lime, while Lime acquired ""tens of thousands"" of Uber's Jump bikes - and the associated intellectual property.Lime's chief executive Wayne Ting has said he prefers the design of Uber's bikes and will deploy more of them in the future.However, there were also ""tens of thousands"" of older-model bikes that Lime did not inherit as part of the deal.Videos shared on Twitter show the bikes arriving at a recycling facility in North Carolina to be destroyed.Disappointed charities and organisations suggested the bikes could have been donated to community groups, or sold to individuals to boost the uptake of electric bikes.""Why not at least peel the decals [branding] off and sell the bikes to individuals?"" Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, a non-profit group, told news site Motherboard.""We explored donating the remaining, older-model bikes,"" Uber said in a statement.""But given many significant issues - including maintenance, liability, safety concerns, and a lack of consumer-grade charging equipment - we decided the best approach was to responsibly recycle them.""",28 May 2020,technology
Twitter fact-checks China amid bias row,"Twitter, under intense scrutiny for its use of fact-checking warnings, has added them to tweets from China's foreign ministry spokesperson.The warning has been added to tweets from spokesman Lijian Zhao, in which he warned: ""It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.""Twitter added the warning more than two months after the tweets were posted.It comes amid a row with the White House, after similar warnings were added to tweets from President Trump.Mr Trump is now poised to sign an executive order targeting social-media firms, the White House said, in a significant escalation of the dispute. Earlier this week, after Twitter added its fact-checking links to President Trump's tweets, he threatened to ""shut down"" social networks for alleged anti-conservative bias.The warnings on Lijian Zhao's tweets were added after the US developments.One tweet, from 12 March, criticised the US Centers for Disease Control for a lack of clarity before alleging that it ""might be"" that the US army was somehow involved in the Wuhan outbreak.In another tweet the following day, he linked to an article claiming to have evidence that the virus originated in the United States, encouraging people to read and retweet it - which thousands did.Both tweets now contains a bright blue exclamation mark urging readers to ""Get the facts about Covid-19"". Clicking it directs the user to a page of tweets about the World Health Organization's research that suggests the virus originated in animals, and downplays theories about deliberate human involvement in its spread.The New York Post, which broke the story, said Twitter had added the warning only after its reporters put pressure on the company over alleged ""double standards"" between the Chinese official and Mr Trump.A Twitter spokesperson would not confirm whether that was the case, saying only that Mr Zhao's tweets ""contain potentially misleading content about Covid-19"" and were labelled to ""provide additional context"".Twitter founder Jack Dorsey meanwhile, appealed to users to ""please leave our employees out of this"" as the row with the White House erupted.Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, has been blamed by many Conservatives as the man behind the effort to fact-check the president. Many prominent Republican voices on Twitter pointed to old tweets by Mr Roth which refer to ""Nazis in the White House"" and other insults about the president and his allies.Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House aide with the job title of counsellor to the president, appeared to encourage supporters to contact Mr Roth online, saying on Fox News that someone should ""go wake him up and tell him he's about to get more followers"". Twitter, however, insists that no one person is responsible for its fact-checking decisions.""There is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me,"" Mr Dorsey tweeted, promising to continue to ""point out incorrect or disputed information"".""Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions,"" he said.The approach differs from that of Facebook.Sir Nick Clegg, a prominent former UK politician turned Facebook's vice-president of communications, said the company doesn't believe ""a private tech company like ours should be in the business of vetting what politicians say about each other"", the Telegraph reports.""We think people should be allowed to hear what politicians say so they can make up their own mind and hold the politician to account,"" he said.",28 May 2020,technology

Earlier this week, after Twitter added its fact-checking links to President Trump's tweets, he threatened to ""shut down"" social networks for alleged anti-conservative bias.The warnings on Lijian Zhao's tweets were added after the US developments.One tweet, from 12 March, criticised the US Centers for Disease Control for a lack of clarity before alleging that it ""might be"" that the US army was somehow involved in the Wuhan outbreak.In another tweet the following day, he linked to an article claiming to have evidence that the virus originated in the United States, encouraging people to read and retweet it - which thousands did.Both tweets now contains a bright blue exclamation mark urging readers to ""Get the facts about Covid-19"". Clicking it directs the user to a page of tweets about the World Health Organization's research that suggests the virus originated in animals, and downplays theories about deliberate human involvement in its spread.The New York Post, which broke the story, said Twitter had added the warning only after its reporters put pressure on the company over alleged ""double standards"" between the Chinese official and Mr Trump.A Twitter spokesperson would not confirm whether that was the case, saying only that Mr Zhao's tweets ""contain potentially misleading content about Covid-19"" and were labelled to ""provide additional context"".Twitter founder Jack Dorsey meanwhile, appealed to users to ""please leave our employees out of this"" as the row with the White House erupted.Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, has been blamed by many Conservatives as the man behind the effort to fact-check the president. Many prominent Republican voices on Twitter pointed to old tweets by Mr Roth which refer to ""Nazis in the White House"" and other insults about the president and his allies.Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House aide with the job title of counsellor to the president, appeared to encourage supporters to contact Mr Roth online, saying on Fox News that someone should ""go wake him up and tell him he's about to get more followers"". Twitter, however, insists that no one person is responsible for its fact-checking decisions.""There is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me,"" Mr Dorsey tweeted, promising to continue to ""point out incorrect or disputed information"".""Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions,"" he said.The approach differs from that of Facebook.Sir Nick Clegg, a prominent former UK politician turned Facebook's vice-president of communications, said the company doesn't believe ""a private tech company like ours should be in the business of vetting what politicians say about each other"", the Telegraph reports.""We think people should be allowed to hear what politicians say so they can make up their own mind and hold the politician to account,"" he said.",28 May 2020,technology
Video streaming: Lockdown sees fifth of UK homes sign deals,"One in five households in Britain – six million – signed up to an online video subscription service during the Covid-19 lockdown, data suggests.The majority of those sign-ups, 52%, are going to Disney+, according to market research firm Kantar.The most-enjoyed piece of content, though, was Netflix’s exclusive documentary series Tiger King.AppleTV+ struggled to engage TV viewers, however, according to the research.Kantar’s data shows the tech giant’s TV service was popular on smartphone and tablet devices, but lagged behind competitors in terms of TV screen viewing.“It’s been a huge quarter for streaming in the UK. We can certainly associate a good deal of that with the current lockdown situation,” Dominic Sunnebo, senior vice president at Kantar, told the BBC.Mr Sunnebo also noted the instant popularity of Disney+, which only launched in the UK on 24 March.“Of people who are in the video streaming sector already, one in five now have a Disney+ streaming subscription,” he said. “It’s unheard of.”There are now, on average, 2.3 online video subscriptions per household in the UK. Although comparable data is not available for previous years, Mr Sunnebo said that because of the launch of new services such as Disney+, it was safe to assume that the average number of online video subscriptions had risen comfortably in the last couple of years.He added that 36% of new subscriptions between February and April – 2.2 million – were made by people who had never previously signed up to a streaming service.Kantar’s data is gathered from a panel of 15,000 consumers and interviews with 2,500 new streaming service subscribers each quarter.Apple struggled to make the same impact with TV viewers, however.Mr Sunnebo argued that this was probably because that easiest way to access Apple TV+ on a TV screen was through purchasing a separate device, the Apple TV media player.Apple’s strategy, he said, was to rely on slowly building an audience of viewers happy to pay for this hardware.“By trying to drive Apple TV sales in the meantime, they’re continuing to generate revenue and biding time to broaden their catalogue of content,” he added.Recent examples of this include the addition of old episodes of the children's show Fraggle Rock as well the commission of new ones. And, according to news site Deadline, Apple has just struck a deal to stream Martin Scorsese's forthcoming film Killers of the Flower Moon, which is set to feature Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert DeNiro.",28 May 2020,technology
Zipline drones deliver supplies and PPE to US hospitals,"Drone firm Zipline has been given the go-ahead to deliver medical supplies and personal protective equipment to hospitals in North Carolina.The firm will be allowed to use drones on two specified routes after the Federal Aviation Administration granted it an emergency waiver.It is the first time the FAA has allowed beyond-line-of-sight drone deliveries in the US.Experts say the pandemic could help ease some drone-flight regulations.Zipline, which has been negotiating with the FAA, wants to expand to other hospitals and eventually offer deliveries to people's homes.It has been granted a waiver for two routes involving round trips of up to 30 miles (48km).The drones will launch from a nearby fulfilment centre and drop off a box of medical products by parachute at a designated spots. The drones can carry up to almost 4lb (1.8kg) of cargo and can fly at up to 80mph, even in rain or wind.""The Covid-19 pandemic has tasked us with being even more nimble and innovative in how to solve complex challenges,"" said Angela Yochem, chief digital officer of Novant Health, which is the partner for the service.""Fast-tracking our medical drone transport capability is just one example of how we're pioneering in the health care industry, which is known for being resistant to change,"" Zipline has struggled to find a commercial foothold in the US market, but chief executive Keller Rinaudo said he hoped the North Carolina example could ""provide the rest of the country with a blueprint"" for future healthcare deliveries.The pandemic has prompted a handful of new drone deliveries. The Windracers Ultra fixed-wing drone has been delivering PPE from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight - a 10-minute journey - and in Ireland, Manna Aero is working with the health authority to deliver prescriptions and other essential supplies to a small rural town.Robotics expert Prof Noel Sharkey believes the pandemic could make drone deliveries more common.""In a global pandemic everything changes,"" he said.""Rules and laws need to be manipulated and restrictions lifted to enable the use of all possible technological advantages to save large numbers of lives. ""The problem of course is how to wind back the clock on tech once we are out of the Covid-19 crisis.""",27 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: NHS app paves the way for 'immunity passports',"Facial recognition has been added as a way of logging in to an NHS app that lets people order prescriptions, book appointments and find healthcare data.Initially, it will allow faster access to the services on the app, which is separate from the contact-tracing one.But its developers say it could also be used for Covid-19 ""immunity passports"".Such passports, where people carry documented proof they have immunity because of a past infection, are already being tested in Estonia.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has previously hinted at the possible use of a ""system of certification"" for those with antibodies for coronavirus.The NHS facial-recognition system, built by iProov and available in England for both Android devices and iOS, requires users to submit a photo of themselves from an official document such as their passport or driving license. The system scans a person's face using their phone and, following a short sequence of flashing colours, their identification will be verified and they will have access to all the services on the NHS app.More than a million people have now registered with NHS login, with a peak of more than 60,000 new IDs verified during the first week of April.Founder Andrew Bud told BBC News: ""NHS Digital has built a strong and trusted identity system in NHS login, which, in my opinion, should form the basis of the UK's immunity passport. ""Whether they do so is a decision for them.""In response, a spokesperson for NHS Digital said it ""has not been commissioned to apply this technology to any other purposes beyond providing a secure login capability via mobile devices"".Immunity passports need to link a person's identity to their coronavirus test results, so would require a robust way of allowing people to verify themselves. Those deemed clear of the virus could then prove their status via a code generated by an app. The idea has proved controversial, not least because there is no hard scientific evidence that having had the coronavirus provides people with long-lasting immunity.The World Health Organization has warned countries against implementing such passports, saying: ""There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.""But Mr Bud said: ""At-home antibody tests are coming soon and will quickly cause the creation of a whole information system, of which they will be at the heart. ""That is inevitable and is no longer subject to political choice.""There are big questions that this system will pose to society - such as how to discourage people from uploading false immunity results, how to prevent discrimination on the basis of immunity status and how to stop information leaking uncontrollably.""Estonia has begun testing one of the world's first immunity passports, which would allow citizens to show their coronavirus test results to third parties, such as employers or even restaurants.Taavet Hinrikus, founder of Transferwise, the company is developing the technology for the Estonian system, said it would ""diminish fears and stimulate societies all over the globe to move on with their lives amidst the pandemic"".But Dr Tom Fisher, a senior researcher at Privacy International, said the implementation of such measures needed to be ""necessary, proportionate and based on the epidemiological evidence"".""For the moment, immunity passports do not meet this test,"" he said.""We must be concerned about the broad societal impact of such immunity passports. ""They are essentially about limiting the rights of those who are not deemed to be immune. ""This is a route to exclusion and discrimination.""Similarly, an improperly implemented programme risks perverse effects, like people deliberately seeking to get infected to gain the benefits of a status of being immune.""Robin Tombs, the chief executive of digital identity company Yoti said it would be ""technically simple"" to extend its work with coronavirus testers at GeneMe to antibody tests but: ""The science on Covid-19 immunity is still too early to issue meaningful immunity passports.""",27 May 2020,technology
Facebook shareholders try to block encryption plan,"Investors at Facebook's annual stockholder meeting will vote on a proposal to postpone the firm's plans for end-to-end encryption.The firm says it wants to make the measure the default option across its messaging platforms to protect privacy.But activist shareholders say this would make it nearly impossible to detect child exploitation on Facebook.The group wants the company to delay the move until after its board of directors studies the risk further. ""As shareholders, we know that privacy is important to a social media company, but it should not come at the expense of unleashing a whole new torrent of virtually undetectable child sexual abuse on Facebook,"" said Michael Passoff, founder of Proxy Impact, a shareholder advocacy service supporting the measure.Facebook's 2020 annual shareholders' meeting will be held virtually due to Covid-19, but investors will still be able to vote on measures and hear about the management plans.Facebook claims to be a leader in fighting child exploitation on the internet. ""As we expand end-to-end encryption to secure people's private messages from hackers and criminals we remain committed to leading our industry in keeping children safe,"" it said.The measure is unlikely to pass. Most of the company's voting shares are controlled by Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and a small number of other executives.In March 2019, Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted the firm to make end-to-end encryption the base level of security for all its messaging services - including Facebook Messenger and Instagram messaging. But he did not lay out a timeline, and many engineers thought it would be several years before it happened.The initiative would mean that messages - including text and imagery - are digitally scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can make sense of them, and not Facebook itself.WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, already has this level of security. The US, UK and Australian governments have been among those pressuring Facebook to create a backdoor or other workaround that would give them access to  messages to help in criminal investigations. The company has so far refused to do this.The measure put forward by Proxy Impact would force Facebook to examine whether something could be done to mitigate ""the risk of increased sexual exploitation of children"" as a consequence.In 2019, tech companies reported close to 70 million videos and pictures of children being sexually exploited to authorities. Nearly 85% of those reports came from Facebook.According to Mr Passoff, if the firm were to go through with its encryption plans, 70% of the cases it reports would become invisible to the firm.For Facebook, this is a matter of balancing privacy and public security.Users have expressed anger in the past at Facebook's use and protection of their personal data. End-to-end encryption should prevent criminals from gaining access to private conversations and help protect personal and financial data, assuming users' devices are not compromised.It would also offer the firm a defence against being responsible for detecting and reporting criminal and terrorist activity, as it would no longer be able to read the messages involved.Some investors supporting the measure claim this could prove damaging to the company.""Numerous controversies have eroded its reputational capital and put the company at risk for future competitive threats,"" said Lisette Cooper, vice-chair of Fiduciary Trust International, which is supporting the vote.  ""The position of Facebook as the world's number one hub for online child sexual abuse material is not the marketing strategy you want to have for long-term success.""However, Mr Zuckerberg has previously addressed the issue directly.""When we were deciding whether to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this was one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,"" he said in October.But he added that he was ""optimistic"" that predators could still be identified by other means, including their patterns of activity.",27 May 2020,technology
Twitter tags Trump tweet with fact-checking warning,"A post by US President Donald Trump has been given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time.Mr Trump tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""Twitter put a warning label in the post and linked to a page that described the claims as ""unsubstantiated"".Mr Trump on Wednesday threatened to ""strongly regulate"" or even ""close down"" social media platforms.He tweeted to his 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"" and that he would not allow this to happen. In an earlier tweet, he said that Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".Later on Wednesday he said that Twitter ""has now shown everything we have been saying about them... is correct"" and vowed ""big action to follow"".It is unclear what regulatory steps the president could take without new laws passed by Congress. The White House has yet to offer further details.For years, Twitter has faced criticism for not acting on the president's controversial tweets, which include personal attacks on political rivals and debunked conspiracy theories. This month the platform introduced a new policy on misleading information amid the coronavirus pandemic.But recent posts in which Mr Trump - who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter - promoted a conspiracy theory about the death of political aide Lori Klausutis, blaming a high-profile critic, have not received the same treatment.The notification on Mr Trump's tweet shows a blue exclamation mark and a link suggesting readers ""get the facts about mail-in ballots"".It directs users to a page on which Mr Trump's claims are described as ""unsubstantiated"", citing reporting by CNN, the Washington Post and others.The pandemic is putting pressure on US states to expand the use of postal voting because people are worried about becoming infected at polling stations.In a ""what you need to know"" section, Twitter writes that Mr Trump ""falsely claimed mail-in ballots would lead to 'a Rigged Election'."" ""Fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud,"" it continues.The company had pledged to increase the use of warning labels about false or misleading information on its site, but has been slow to take steps against the US president.Mr Trump posted the same claim about mail-in ballots on Facebook, but it is not fact-checked on that platform.Mr Trump then accused Twitter of interfering in the US presidential election scheduled for 3 November 2020, saying the company was ""completely stifling free speech, and I, as president, will not allow it to happen"".His tweet on Wednesday told social media to ""clean up your act now"" and that he would not let a ""more sophisticated version"" of what they had ""attempted to do, and failed, in 2016"" happen again. He did not elaborate.With more than 52,000 tweets currently to his name, Mr Trump is a prolific tweeter and relies on the platform to disseminate his views to millions of people.He has used Twitter to launch attacks on opponents, with targets ranging from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to his political rivals in the US.In 2017 he used anti-Muslim tweets aimed at London Mayor Sadiq Khan to serve a domestic political purpose of warning about immigration, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher reported.On Tuesday Mr Trump's presidential campaign manager Brad Parscale also criticised Twitter's decision.""Partnering with biased fake news 'fact checkers' is a smoke screen to lend Twitter's obvious political tactics false credibility. There are many reasons we pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and clear political bias is one of them,"" Mr Parscale tweeted.They are voting bulletins that are distributed and returned by post. In a recent opinion survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 66% of Americans said they would not be comfortable going to a polling place to cast their ballot during the coronavirus outbreak.Such concerns have increased pressure on states to expand the availability of mail-in ballots for all voters in order to minimise the risk of viral exposure from in-person voting.While every state provides some form of remote voting, the requirements to qualify vary greatly.Five states in the western US, including Washington, Oregon and Colorado, conduct their elections entirely via mail-in ballot. Others, like California, provide a postal ballot to anyone who requests it.On the other end of the spectrum, 17 states require voters to provide a valid reason why they are unable to vote in-person in order to qualify for an absentee ballot. The move comes on the heels of Twitter's decision not to remove a comment President Trump made about the death of Lori Klausutis in 2001. The president has tweeted several messages promoting a conspiracy theory that Ms Klausutis was murdered by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Her widower Timothy Klausutis asked Twitter to remove the post, saying it included ""horrifying lies"".The company told Mr Klausutis it was ""deeply sorry"" about the pain caused by the president's statements, but said the tweets did not violate their policies.",27 May 2020,technology
Huawei: What would happen if the UK ditched the Chinese firm?,"Huawei's future in the UK is in doubt - again.The consequences could affect how quickly improved internet access is rolled out and how much it will cost. This a time when the country's economy is already in a precarious state because of the coronavirus pandemic.The catalyst for a potential rethink is the US's move to restrict the firm's ability to buy chips, which was justified on ""national security grounds"".On Sunday, the UK's National Security Centre (NCSC) confirmed it was examining what impact this would have on the UK networks that use Huawei's tech.That sounds quite vague. But it potentially paves the way for a government U-turn.In January, the prime minister gave the green light to continued use of the firm's tech in mobile and broadband networks, but said its its market share must be reduced.Now he might appreciate the chance for change of mind.It would help Boris Johnson prevent backbenchers who favour a ban from derailing his forthcoming Telecoms Infrastructure Bill. Moreover, it offers him a way to defuse tensions with the White House, which has said continued use of Huawei will have a ""dramatic impact on our ability to share [security] information"".Mr Johnson and President Trump may meet next month at a mooted G7 summit. Blocking Huawei could help secure a post-Brexit trade deal, even if it made relations with China trickier.But the company warns there would be consequences.""More suppliers means greater competition, innovation and network reliability, and crucially ensures consumers have access to the best possible technology,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief, told the BBC.""Removing Huawei would seriously delay 5G, costing the British economy up to £7bn,"" he added, citing a study published last year by Mobile UK, a trade group that represents UK network operators.Part of the reason mobile providers are concerned is that the current version of 5G relies on new equipment being plugged into existing 4G kit from the same vendor.""A lot of the 4G expansion was software-upgradeable to do 5G when an extra mast antenna was fitted,"" explained Andrew Ferguson, editor-in-chief of the news site ThinkBroadband.So, he added, even if a Huawei ban was limited to the newer technology, networks would still have to rip out and replace some of their older infrastructure as well.""It's not only a very expensive process for the operators, but it's going to be a time-consuming one as well because they need to get access to all those sites to make the changes,"" added Matthew Howett from Assembly, the consultancy that wrote Mobile UK's report.""And Huawei has been very innovative at coming up with the smallest and lightest 5G equipment, meaning the operators can sometimes just use a cherry picker to hook it onto existing mast infrastructure. Some of the others' is heavier and bulkier, which can require more in terms of getting planning consent and road closures.""Huawei's major 5G rivals are Nokia and Ericsson - two European firms.The networks claim that having three providers to choose from helps them negotiate lower prices. In many cases, they want a mix of two suppliers so that if technical problems arise with one they can fall back on the other to provide a reduced service. That doesn't always involve Huawei - O2 for instance picked Nokia and Ericsson to be its primary 5G vendors despite having trialled the Chinese firm's kit.A study commissioned by Huawei last year claimed locking it out would increase a country's 5G investment costs by between 8% and 29% due to reduced competition.And if mobile providers have to spend more, consumers can expect their bills to rise too.But one MP opposed to Huawei's rollout says there are more important considerations.""There's a free and fair competition element here, there's a security element, there's a data-privacy element, and there's a sort of geopolitics of Chinese influence as well - the influence of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Bob Seely, a member of the foreign affairs committee, told the BBC.""There shouldn't on principle be high-risk vendors in the communications network.""Huawei denies it uses state subsidies to undercut its rivals, adding that it would never spy on China's behalf or otherwise deliberately compromise its clients.Huawei is also a big player in fixed-line broadband.It currently accounts for about 44% of the equipment used in providing super-fast full-fibre connections directly to homes, office and other buildings, according to UK regulator Ofcom.BT's Openreach division aims to bring that in line with a 35% government target by using more kit from Nokia and the US firm Adtran.But this sidesteps the fact that more properties rely on an alternative set-up in which fibre only reaches roadside cabinets, and the last leg is supplied by a copper-based connection. The reason this is relevant is that tens of thousands of the cabinets involved are Huawei's.""They connect directly to the core of the network,"" commented Mr Ferguson.""But replacing those is a complete non-starter unless someone's going to throw many billions of pounds at it and also all the people to do the work."" While Huawei's opponents would prefer it to be gone altogether, they acknowledge this is impractical in the short term.But Mr Seely suggested that cabinets and other such products should be swapped out for alternatives when they are ""up for replacement"".One thing practically everyone agrees on is that the matter needs to be settled once and for at a time when so much else about the economy is uncertain.""These procurement decisions can take 18 months to two years to finalise and it takes time to ramp up supply to meet the demand,"" said Mr Howett.""So this isn't just a question of overnight deciding not to use Huawei - it would take many years to do it properly.""",26 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Hairdressers offer virtual appointments in lockdown,"Hairdressers have been offering virtual appointments to help people style their hair at home.Stylists are using apps including FaceTime, Zoom, and YouTube to provide customers live one-to-one advice and tutorials.While salons have already reopened in France and Germany, hairdressers in the UK expect to remain closed until July.An industry report estimated the hair and beauty sector contributed £6.6bn to the country's economy last year.Paul Phillips owns Chopp Hair salon in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, which shut in March when the coronavirus lockdown began.He provides a service called Chopp Drops, in which he delivers hair products to customers’ doorsteps and then demonstrates via video call how to apply the treatment.“Most hairdressers say you should never colour your hair at home, and in normal times I’d agree,” he says. “But lots of clients’ mental health has been affected by the current situation, so sorting out grey roots and split ends makes them feel better.”Paul says he serves up to 26 clients a day, but adds that he is cautious to only offer advice that is achievable at home.“It’s too technical to dye blonde hair, so those clients sadly have to sit tight and wait for the lockdown to be over,” he explains. “You don’t want somebody to mess up and then have to live with it for another seven weeks.”Most of the hairdressers the BBC spoke to offered bespoke hair kits and virtual appointments priced between £30 and £150.Ebuni Ajiduah is a hair loss-specialist. She has also moved her appointments online, offering clients home treatments, and when required referring them to dermatologists for further advice. “People now have the time to focus on things they may have neglected,” she says, adding that she’s seen an increased demand for her services.Ebuni has also launched a Virtual Wash Day every Sunday, when she invites people to join her on Zoom to wash, treat, and style hair together.“We talk about the products we use and how we twist our hair,” she says. “It’s really nice, you get some people in shower caps and others trying to keep their kids still.“It gives people a sense of normalcy when the world is on fire - you can still have a routine and focus time on yourself.”Some hairdressers advise against cutting your own hair but are still offering other tips online.“I've trimmed mine at the front but even I wouldn't attempt [to cut] mine at the back,” Michael Van Clarke says in a video on Instagram. Instead, he proceeds to show the audience how to style short hair that has grown out over a few weeks.Since closing its doors, the team from his salon has been posting videos on social media and booking virtual colour consultations, serving more than 3,000 customers online.“We have new clients which have never even been to our salon, the demand is huge,” Mr Van Clarke says. “It’s a lot easier to do the video consultations if we’ve seen them in person before, but we are still able to give advice to new customers.”Senior technicians carry out a hair assessment over an initial video call, advise on treatments and products, send them out and then offer a follow-up consultation to observe and guide the client.“Some people like their hands held for reassurance, so our technicians can show them how to hold the brush and how long to leave colour on for,” Mr Van Clarke adds.Gina Conway, who runs three salons in London, thinks this could become the ""new normal"".“Even when lockdown is over, it’s going to be chaos,” she explains. “Some people might not be able to afford to go to the salon, they might be working from home or looking after children still, so I hope we can relieve that stress through technology.”Gina says she’s now pivoting to focus on the internet.“At first I was hesitant as I wanted to keep my business as professional as possible, but this is our way of giving proper advice and helping people to feel good about themselves.”",25 May 2020,technology
How Coronavirus lockdown made a 'Zoom boom' generation,"I first realised just how quickly attitudes towards technology were changing when my mum told me, two days after lockdown began, that she had downloaded Skype.She's not exactly an early adopter - in fact, she has resolutely refused to video call anybody, ever, until now.Lockdown has removed the luxury of choice for many of us. If you want to see your relatives, it has to be on screen.As we get over the social awkwardness of the ""Zoom boom"" - when to mute that mic, when to stop talking - we're realising that, for the most part, video chat works. Whether it's family reunions, pub quizzes, office meetings or even pet appointments with the vet, we can get together quickly without being in the same room - and there's a good chance that is going to stick.Twitter has already told its staff they don't ever need to go back into the office again, and Cambridge University says its lectures will remain purely online until the summer of 2021. This week Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that up to 50% of the workforce could be working from home in the next 5-10 years. The tech giant's head of Virtual Reality, Andrew Bosworth, shared a fascinating video of what a mixed reality workspace - a combination of the real world and digital images - might look like.As we think through supercharging remote work and productivity, we've been working on mixed reality concepts that builds on existing technologies like Passthrough to allow people to switch between real and virtual worlds pic.twitter.com/cJCEXDxC7bEnd of Twitter post  by @boztankBroadly speaking the internet infrastructure has coped pretty well with everyone piling onto it - at least for those with access to more robust services.Some experts have long called for the net to be recognised as a public utility, alongside electricity, water and gas - as well as the requisite regulation that comes with it - and perhaps it has finally earned its spurs. John Graham-Cumming, from internet security firm Cloudflare, said the company is now seeing three daily peaks for internet traffic around the world - first thing in the morning, lunchtime and early evening - and they are bigger than ever.""If you think about the internet as a utility, can you think of another utility that could sustain 50% growth [in traffic]?"" he said.""The net has been a reliable sidekick through all this."" And the tech firms have certainly spotted their opportunity. Microsoft's Satya Nadella says digital transformation has advanced two years in two months, as we seek to be entertained, to be connected and to keep track of what is happening during the pandemic.We can already see investment and goodwill getting behind tech alternatives in the hunt for new ways of doing things: could this be the moment drone deliveries finally take off (pardon the pun), e-scooters get an easier ride, and virtual gyms put our post-lockdown bodies through their paces, via a headset, in the comfort of our own homes?History will eventually reveal whether lockdown was the dawn of a new era or merely a blip before things returned to the way they were.For tech to truly prove itself as a game-changer, it has to become part of the furniture: consistent, reliable and, therefore, totally unremarkable. And as anyone who has experienced an unexpected outage at a frustrating moment in the past few weeks will tell you, we're not quite there yet.",25 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: France gives green light to contact-tracing app,"France is set to launch its coronavirus contact-tracing app as soon as the weekend after it cleared two parliamentary votes.The country's Senate approved its release by a vote of 187-to-127 on Wednesday evening, following an earlier 338-to-215 National Assembly vote.A bug bounty scheme will be run to encourage the public to help identify any flaws in the software.But critics claim it suffers from a ""fundamentally flawed design"".The StopCovid app will supplement work already being done by a French team of human contact tracers who are trying to identify people who are infected with the disease but unaware of the fact.The app works by using Bluetooth signals to detect when two handsets are in close proximity, in order to log an estimation of the distance and length of the encounter.France, like the UK, has opted for a ""centralised"" app, which carries out contact matches on a computer server.That contrasts with the ""decentralised"" model - an approach advocated by Google and Apple - which carries out matches on users' own devices.The main differences between the two are that centralised apps provide the authorities greater scope to delve into gathered data to refine their approach to tackling the pandemic, while decentralised ones in theory promise users a greater degree of anonymity and privacy.The French government has made appeals to national pride over its decision to roll out a proprietary solution.It faces having an incompatible system to its neighbours Germany, Switzerland and Italy as a consequence.""This is a French project, with the excellence but also the panache and some would say the stubbornness which characterises our country,"" Digital Affairs Minister Cedric O said on Wednesday.""Is it really a coincidence that 22 countries have used the Apple-Google API [application programming interface], but not France and Britain, which are the only two countries in Europe with their own nuclear deterrent?""The risk for the French government is that its decision to adopt the centralised model deters members of the public from installing it.The app's developers have acknowledged that although users' identities are anonymised before they upload their logs to the central server, it is in theory still possible to re-identify them afterwards.That has concerned civil rights activists.""It could threaten the right to privacy and more generally the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly because it opens up a way to monitor the interactions of everyone who installs it,"" Amnesty International France has said.Some security researchers have also called for the rollout to be delayed until a Bluetooth vulnerability - full details of which have yet to be made public - is addressed. The issue does no affect apps based on the Apple-Google model.The French government has, however, invited a select group of ""ethical hackers"" to audit the app's code in advance of its launch. And it has teamed up with the European bug bounty programme YesWeHack, which will offer cash rewards to anyone who finds critical flaws in the program after its release.England had originally planned to launch its own NHS Covid-19 app nationwide in conjunction with the start of phone calls by its Test and Trace team of human investigators.Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he now wants to stagger the two, and plans to deploy the app within the next fortnight.Before then, NHSX is set to carry out a second phase of a trial of the software already under way on the Isle of Wight.At present, the app solely relies on users self-diagnosing themselves via a series of on-screen questions. The next stage of the test will involve incorporating medical test results.Other parts of the UK have still to decide whether to deploy the same app locally or take a different approach.",28 May 2020,technology
Twitter fact-checks China amid bias row,"Twitter, under intense scrutiny for its use of fact-checking warnings, has added them to tweets from China's foreign ministry spokesperson.The warning has been added to tweets from spokesman Lijian Zhao, in which he warned: ""It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.""Twitter added the warning more than two months after the tweets were posted.It comes amid a row with the White House, after similar warnings were added to tweets from President Trump.Mr Trump is now poised to sign an executive order targeting social-media firms, the White House said, in a significant escalation of the dispute. Earlier this week, after Twitter added its fact-checking links to President Trump's tweets, he threatened to ""shut down"" social networks for alleged anti-conservative bias.The warnings on Lijian Zhao's tweets were added after the US developments.One tweet, from 12 March, criticised the US Centers for Disease Control for a lack of clarity before alleging that it ""might be"" that the US army was somehow involved in the Wuhan outbreak.In another tweet the following day, he linked to an article claiming to have evidence that the virus originated in the United States, encouraging people to read and retweet it - which thousands did.Both tweets now contains a bright blue exclamation mark urging readers to ""Get the facts about Covid-19"". Clicking it directs the user to a page of tweets about the World Health Organization's research that suggests the virus originated in animals, and downplays theories about deliberate human involvement in its spread.The New York Post, which broke the story, said Twitter had added the warning only after its reporters put pressure on the company over alleged ""double standards"" between the Chinese official and Mr Trump.A Twitter spokesperson would not confirm whether that was the case, saying only that Mr Zhao's tweets ""contain potentially misleading content about Covid-19"" and were labelled to ""provide additional context"".Twitter founder Jack Dorsey meanwhile, appealed to users to ""please leave our employees out of this"" as the row with the White House erupted.Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, has been blamed by many Conservatives as the man behind the effort to fact-check the president. Many prominent Republican voices on Twitter pointed to old tweets by Mr Roth which refer to ""Nazis in the White House"" and other insults about the president and his allies.Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House aide with the job title of counsellor to the president, appeared to encourage supporters to contact Mr Roth online, saying on Fox News that someone should ""go wake him up and tell him he's about to get more followers"". Twitter, however, insists that no one person is responsible for its fact-checking decisions.""There is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me,"" Mr Dorsey tweeted, promising to continue to ""point out incorrect or disputed information"".""Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions,"" he said.The approach differs from that of Facebook.Sir Nick Clegg, a prominent former UK politician turned Facebook's vice-president of communications, said the company doesn't believe ""a private tech company like ours should be in the business of vetting what politicians say about each other"", the Telegraph reports.""We think people should be allowed to hear what politicians say so they can make up their own mind and hold the politician to account,"" he said.",28 May 2020,technology
Uber destroys thousands of bikes and scooters,"Uber is destroying thousands of electric bikes and scooters, after selling its Jump business to Lime.Videos of its red bikes being crushed at a recycling centre were shared on social media, angering cycling advocates.Uber said it had decided to destroy thousands of its older-model vehicles due to maintenance, liability and safety concerns.In the UK, Uber continues to operate Jump and has not scrapped any bikes.A spokesman told the BBC the sale of Jump to Lime had not been completed in Europe, and that Jump continued to operate ""as normal"" in London.In 2018, Uber said it would focus more on its electric bike and scooter business than on cars.But on 7 May this year, Uber announced a deal that saw Lime take over the Jump bike business.As part of the deal, Uber invested $170m (£139m) in Lime, while Lime acquired ""tens of thousands"" of Uber's Jump bikes - and the associated intellectual property.Lime's chief executive Wayne Ting has said he prefers the design of Uber's bikes and will deploy more of them in the future.However, there were also ""tens of thousands"" of older-model bikes that Lime did not inherit as part of the deal.Videos shared on Twitter show the bikes arriving at a recycling facility in North Carolina to be destroyed.Disappointed charities and organisations suggested the bikes could have been donated to community groups, or sold to individuals to boost the uptake of electric bikes.""Why not at least peel the decals [branding] off and sell the bikes to individuals?"" Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, a non-profit group, told news site Motherboard.""We explored donating the remaining, older-model bikes,"" Uber said in a statement.""But given many significant issues - including maintenance, liability, safety concerns, and a lack of consumer-grade charging equipment - we decided the best approach was to responsibly recycle them.""",28 May 2020,technology
Pulling apart a £339 anti-5G USB stick,"A device costing more than £300 promises to protect your family from the supposed dangers of 5G, using ground-breaking quantum technology - but does it work? Of course not.The rollout of the new 5G mobile networks began in the UK only last summer and has not yet reached outside urban areas. Yet across the country there is already a cottage industry offering protection against the supposed negative health effects, even though they have been dismissed by regulators and mainstream scientists.The 5GBioShield was recommended by a member of Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee, which has called for an inquiry into 5G. One of nine external members, Toby Hall, said: ""We use this device and find it helpful,"" and provided a link to its website, which describes it as a USB key that ""provides protection for  your home and family, thanks to the wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser, which can be worn or placed near to a smartphone or any other electrical, radiation or EMF [electromagnetic field] emitting device"".""Through a process of quantum oscillation, the 5GBioShield USB key balances and re-harmonises the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wi-fi, tablets, et cetera,"" it adds.Each of these USB keys costs £339.60 including VAT, though there is a special offer of three for £958.80.But, at first sight, it seems to be just that - a USB key, with just 128MB of storage.""So what's different between it and a virtually identical 'crystal' USB key available from various suppliers in Shenzhen, China, for around £5 per key?"" asks Ken Munro, whose company, Pen Test Partners, specialises in taking apart consumer electronic products to spot security vulnerabilities.And the answer appears to be a circular sticker. ""Now, we're not 5G quantum experts but said sticker looks remarkably like one available in sheets from stationery suppliers for less than a penny each,"" he says.Mr Munro and his colleague Phil Eveleigh proceeded to dismantle the USB key to find out if there were any whizz-bang electronics inside. But all they found was an LED light on the circuit board, similar to those on any other USB key.They concluded that trading standards bodies should now carry out their own investigations. London Trading Standards has since told the BBC it has launched a probe.A search in Companies House shows the two directors of BioShield Distribution are Anna Grochowalska and Valerio Laghezza. Both of them appear to have been involved previously in a business called Immortalis, which sells a dietary supplement called Klotho Formula. Its website - rather similar in design to that of the BioShield - says Klotho Formula uses a ""proprietary procedure that leads to relativistic time dilation and biological quantum entanglement at the DNA level"".Ms Grochowalska told BBC News her company was the sole global distributor of the 5GBioShield -  but it did not manufacture or own the product. ""We are in possession of a great deal of technical information, with plenty of back-up historical research,"" she said.""As you can understand, we are not authorised to fully disclose all this sensitive information to third parties, for obvious reasons.""And she rejected the suggestion selling a £5 product for more than £300 was unreasonable.""In regard to the costs analysis your research has produced, I believe that the lack of in-depth information will not drive you to the exact computation of our expenses and production costs, including the cost of IP [intellectual property rights], and so on,"" she said.""It is therefore hard to take your evaluation seriously, since you have evidently not researched the background facts in any meaningful way.""Mr Hall said his remarks in Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee report should not be seen as a recommendation to buy the product.But he had no regrets about buying it and since plugging it in had felt beneficial effects, including being able to sleep through the night and having more dreams. ""I also felt a 'calmer' feel to the home,"" he told BBC News.And he had thought the company might be able to develop a system that could offer protection to the whole town of Glastonbury against the effects of radiation from electromagnetic fields.It's worth noting though that the regulator Ofcom has published the results of EMF measurements at 16 sites, which were taken following the launch of 5G. It said that in each case, emissions were ""a small fraction"" of the levels deemed safe under international guidelines.",28 May 2020,technology
Video streaming: Lockdown sees fifth of UK homes sign deals,"One in five households in Britain – six million – signed up to an online video subscription service during the Covid-19 lockdown, data suggests.The majority of those sign-ups, 52%, are going to Disney+, according to market research firm Kantar.The most-enjoyed piece of content, though, was Netflix’s exclusive documentary series Tiger King.AppleTV+ struggled to engage TV viewers, however, according to the research.Kantar’s data shows the tech giant’s TV service was popular on smartphone and tablet devices, but lagged behind competitors in terms of TV screen viewing.“It’s been a huge quarter for streaming in the UK. We can certainly associate a good deal of that with the current lockdown situation,” Dominic Sunnebo, senior vice president at Kantar, told the BBC.Mr Sunnebo also noted the instant popularity of Disney+, which only launched in the UK on 24 March.“Of people who are in the video streaming sector already, one in five now have a Disney+ streaming subscription,” he said. “It’s unheard of.”There are now, on average, 2.3 online video subscriptions per household in the UK. Although comparable data is not available for previous years, Mr Sunnebo said that because of the launch of new services such as Disney+, it was safe to assume that the average number of online video subscriptions had risen comfortably in the last couple of years.He added that 36% of new subscriptions between February and April – 2.2 million – were made by people who had never previously signed up to a streaming service.Kantar’s data is gathered from a panel of 15,000 consumers and interviews with 2,500 new streaming service subscribers each quarter.Apple struggled to make the same impact with TV viewers, however.Mr Sunnebo argued that this was probably because that easiest way to access Apple TV+ on a TV screen was through purchasing a separate device, the Apple TV media player.Apple’s strategy, he said, was to rely on slowly building an audience of viewers happy to pay for this hardware.“By trying to drive Apple TV sales in the meantime, they’re continuing to generate revenue and biding time to broaden their catalogue of content,” he added.Recent examples of this include the addition of old episodes of the children's show Fraggle Rock as well the commission of new ones. And, according to news site Deadline, Apple has just struck a deal to stream Martin Scorsese's forthcoming film Killers of the Flower Moon, which is set to feature Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert DeNiro.",28 May 2020,technology
