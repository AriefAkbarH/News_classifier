Netflix stops charging customers who never watch,"Netflix says it will now start to cancel accounts that have watched nothing in more than a year, but have still been paying subscription fees.The streaming giant says hundreds of thousands of users fall into that ""inactive"" category - and it will now start suspending them.It said the move would save forgetful customers money.Netflix costs between £5.99 and £11.99 a month, and payment details are required to sign up.The company said the notifications would be sent to those people who signed up with a credit card or other payment method, but have not watched anything in the year since signing up.It will do the same for other users who have been paying for the service, but have not watched anything in the past two years.Users with dormant accounts will receive a notification asking if they want to continue with their subscription, and those who do not respond will have their account cancelled. Netflix said less than half a percent of its user-base falls into that category.“You know that sinking feeling when you realise you signed up for something but haven't used it in ages? At Netflix, the last thing we want is people paying for something they're not using,"" product innovation chief Eddy Wu said in a blog post. Affected account holders will receive a warning from Netflix in the form of an email before their accounts are deactivated. Notifications will start arriving this week.""We're asking everyone who has not watched anything on Netflix for a year since they joined to confirm they want to keep their membership,"" Mr Wu said.Netflix will retain viewing data from deactivated accounts, so if a user wants to re-subscribe at a later date they will be able to access their individualised preferences. The company has seen subscriber numbers surge this year, as lockdowns around the world keep people at home, where they want to be entertained.Almost 16 million people created accounts in the first three months of the year, nearly double the new sign-ups it saw in the final months of 2019.

Australia 'records fastest internet speed ever',"Researchers in Australia claim they have recorded the fastest ever internet data speed.A team from Monash, Swinburne and RMIT universities logged a data speed of 44.2 terabits per second (Tbps). At that speed, users could download more than 1,000 high-definition movies in less than a second. According to Ofcom, the average UK broadband speed currently is around 64 megabits per second (Mbps) - a fraction of that recorded in the recent study.Australia lies in the middle of global rankings for internet speeds, and slow connections are a regular source of complaints from users.Researchers said they achieved the new record speed by using a device that replaces around 80 lasers found in some existing telecoms hardware, with a single piece of equipment known as a 'micro-comb'.The micro-comb was planted into and tested - outside the laboratory - using existing infrastructure, similar to that used by Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN).The result was the highest amount of data ever produced by a single optical chip, which are used in modern fibre-optic broadband systems around the world. The Australian team hope their findings offer a glimpse into how internet connections could look in the future. While the data speed far outstrips any reasonable consumer need in today's world, Bill Corcoran, lecturer in electrical and computer systems at Monash University, said it could ultimately help transform a wide variety of industries  - as modern life continues to put increasing pressure on bandwidth infrastructure. The global lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic has seen the internet infrastructure come under unprecedented strain.""We're currently getting a sneak peek of how the infrastructure for the internet will hold up in two to three years' time, due to the unprecedented number of people using the internet for remote work, socialising and streaming,"" said Mr Corcoran.""What our research demonstrates is the ability for fibres that we already have in the ground... to be the backbone of communications networks now and in the future.""""And it's not just Netflix we're talking about here,"" he added. ""This data can be used for self-driving cars and future transportation, and it can help the medicine, education, finance, and e-commerce industries - as well as enable us to read with our grandchildren from kilometres away.""Professor David Moss, of Swinburne University, described the findings as ""an enormous breakthrough"". ""Micro-combs offer enormous promise for us to meet the world's insatiable demand for bandwidth.""",22 May 2020,technology
"Chris Pratt accidentally deleted 51,000 emails","Actor Chris Pratt has shared the moment he accidentally wiped clean his entire email inbox. The Marvel star began sorting through his inbox after telling fans his son, Jack, had teased him for having 35,000 unread messages. Unfortunately, Pratt pressed the wrong button and was forced to watch as 51,000 emails were erased. Pratt shared the moment on Instagram, and fans rushed to poke fun at the incident. ""Yesterday my son was playing with my phone and he gasped in shock looking at the number of unread emails that I have. It's a lot,"" Pratt said.""I'm one of those idiots who will do an IQ test and be like, 'Wanna take an IQ test? Give me your email'. And then I do, which proves my IQ is about seven, I just get junk from everyone and I just don't erase it.""The Guardians of the Galaxy actor said his new goal while taking time off work due to Covid-19 would be to read through 1,000 emails a day.He also made a promise to reply to them all. However, his well-meaning plan fell through when he inexplicably deleted every single message he had ever received.""Fifty-one thousand messages are in the trash,"" Pratt said, adding an expletive as he turned the camera to show the number of emails in his trash slowly decreasing - apparently gone forever.""What did I do? It's just deleting them all. All my email. Oh my God. This could be a real nightmare,"" he added. Fans quickly took to social media to make light of the incident.Many noted similarities between Pratt's mistake and his bumbling character Andy Dwyer from the American sitcom Parks and Recreation. ""Convinced Chris Pratt was not acting when he played Andy Dwyer,"" joked one fan.Pratt finished his own video with a shrug, just saying: ""Fresh start.""",22 May 2020,technology
Fake online reviews under investigation by competition authority,"The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into fake and misleading reviews on several major websites.It said it would examine whether online shops were ""doing enough"" to protect customers as they turn to online shopping during lockdown.The authority warned it would ""not hesitate"" to take action if sites are disobeying the law.That could include taking major retailers to court.""During lockdown, we're more dependent than ever on online shopping, so it's really important that the online reviews we read are genuine opinions,"" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli.""If someone is persuaded to buy something after reading a fake or misleading review, they could end up wasting their money on a product or service that wasn't what they wanted.""Some reviewers are offered money or other incentives in exchange for positive comments.But fake and misleading reviews are illegal under consumer protection law - which bans traders from pretending to be consumers of their own products, for example. The CMA holds websites responsible for adhering to the rules.Last year the CMA estimated that estimated that online reviews potentially influence £23bn ($28bn) of UK customer spending every year.The new investigation will cover areas such as:The CMA declined to name the specific websites it was investigating, but highlighted previous discussions with Facebook, eBay and Instagram about the selling of fake reviews on their platforms.It said Instagram had committed to tackling the market for fake reviews on its platform. The CMA had also found the buying and selling of fake reviews in Facebook groups and on eBay. The regulator said it was ""not currently alleging that any website has acted illegally"" - but would name and shame websites later if it had to take enforcement action against them.Last year, the consumer group Which? said that in the space of a single month, it had found 55,000 posts offering free products to those who wrote good reviews on Amazon.""It is good to see the regulator turning its attention to review sites,"" a spokeswoman for Which? said.It said online platforms needed to take responsibility for the problem.""We are providing further evidence to the CMA that we hope will prove useful in the next phase of its investigation - and we expect the regulator to take appropriate action against platforms found to be falling short in their responsibilities to protect consumers.""",22 May 2020,technology

According to Ofcom, the average UK broadband speed currently is around 64 megabits per second (Mbps) - a fraction of that recorded in the recent study.Australia lies in the middle of global rankings for internet speeds, and slow connections are a regular source of complaints from users.Researchers said they achieved the new record speed by using a device that replaces around 80 lasers found in some existing telecoms hardware, with a single piece of equipment known as a 'micro-comb'.The micro-comb was planted into and tested - outside the laboratory - using existing infrastructure, similar to that used by Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN).The result was the highest amount of data ever produced by a single optical chip, which are used in modern fibre-optic broadband systems around the world. The Australian team hope their findings offer a glimpse into how internet connections could look in the future. While the data speed far outstrips any reasonable consumer need in today's world, Bill Corcoran, lecturer in electrical and computer systems at Monash University, said it could ultimately help transform a wide variety of industries  - as modern life continues to put increasing pressure on bandwidth infrastructure. The global lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic has seen the internet infrastructure come under unprecedented strain.""We're currently getting a sneak peek of how the infrastructure for the internet will hold up in two to three years' time, due to the unprecedented number of people using the internet for remote work, socialising and streaming,"" said Mr Corcoran.""What our research demonstrates is the ability for fibres that we already have in the ground... to be the backbone of communications networks now and in the future.""""And it's not just Netflix we're talking about here,"" he added. ""This data can be used for self-driving cars and future transportation, and it can help the medicine, education, finance, and e-commerce industries - as well as enable us to read with our grandchildren from kilometres away.""Professor David Moss, of Swinburne University, described the findings as ""an enormous breakthrough"". ""Micro-combs offer enormous promise for us to meet the world's insatiable demand for bandwidth.""",22 May 2020,technology
"Chris Pratt accidentally deleted 51,000 emails","Actor Chris Pratt has shared the moment he accidentally wiped clean his entire email inbox. The Marvel star began sorting through his inbox after telling fans his son, Jack, had teased him for having 35,000 unread messages. Unfortunately, Pratt pressed the wrong button and was forced to watch as 51,000 emails were erased. Pratt shared the moment on Instagram, and fans rushed to poke fun at the incident. ""Yesterday my son was playing with my phone and he gasped in shock looking at the number of unread emails that I have. It's a lot,"" Pratt said.""I'm one of those idiots who will do an IQ test and be like, 'Wanna take an IQ test? Give me your email'. And then I do, which proves my IQ is about seven, I just get junk from everyone and I just don't erase it.""The Guardians of the Galaxy actor said his new goal while taking time off work due to Covid-19 would be to read through 1,000 emails a day.He also made a promise to reply to them all. However, his well-meaning plan fell through when he inexplicably deleted every single message he had ever received.""Fifty-one thousand messages are in the trash,"" Pratt said, adding an expletive as he turned the camera to show the number of emails in his trash slowly decreasing - apparently gone forever.""What did I do? It's just deleting them all. All my email. Oh my God. This could be a real nightmare,"" he added. Fans quickly took to social media to make light of the incident.Many noted similarities between Pratt's mistake and his bumbling character Andy Dwyer from the American sitcom Parks and Recreation. ""Convinced Chris Pratt was not acting when he played Andy Dwyer,"" joked one fan.Pratt finished his own video with a shrug, just saying: ""Fresh start.""",22 May 2020,technology
Fake online reviews under investigation by competition authority,"The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched an investigation into fake and misleading reviews on several major websites.It said it would examine whether online shops were ""doing enough"" to protect customers as they turn to online shopping during lockdown.The authority warned it would ""not hesitate"" to take action if sites are disobeying the law.That could include taking major retailers to court.""During lockdown, we're more dependent than ever on online shopping, so it's really important that the online reviews we read are genuine opinions,"" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli.""If someone is persuaded to buy something after reading a fake or misleading review, they could end up wasting their money on a product or service that wasn't what they wanted.""Some reviewers are offered money or other incentives in exchange for positive comments.But fake and misleading reviews are illegal under consumer protection law - which bans traders from pretending to be consumers of their own products, for example. The CMA holds websites responsible for adhering to the rules.Last year the CMA estimated that estimated that online reviews potentially influence £23bn ($28bn) of UK customer spending every year.The new investigation will cover areas such as:The CMA declined to name the specific websites it was investigating, but highlighted previous discussions with Facebook, eBay and Instagram about the selling of fake reviews on their platforms.It said Instagram had committed to tackling the market for fake reviews on its platform. The CMA had also found the buying and selling of fake reviews in Facebook groups and on eBay. The regulator said it was ""not currently alleging that any website has acted illegally"" - but would name and shame websites later if it had to take enforcement action against them.Last year, the consumer group Which? said that in the space of a single month, it had found 55,000 posts offering free products to those who wrote good reviews on Amazon.""It is good to see the regulator turning its attention to review sites,"" a spokeswoman for Which? said.It said online platforms needed to take responsibility for the problem.""We are providing further evidence to the CMA that we hope will prove useful in the next phase of its investigation - and we expect the regulator to take appropriate action against platforms found to be falling short in their responsibilities to protect consumers.""",22 May 2020,technology

A New York Times article from 2019 also highlighted the concerns some transgender editors have about volunteering for the site. One editor told the paper they received death threats. Wikipedia is not a formal social media platform like Facebook or Twitter. But its editors can interact with one another and can change the content on a page after it has been written.This has led to a form of harassment where, after one volunteer adds to a page, another volunteer will remove or change that work moments later, forcing the first editor to redo their work and leading to editing battles.The development of a new code of conduct will take place in two phases.The first will include setting policies for in-person and virtual events as well as policies for technical spaces including chat rooms and other Wikimedia projects. It is set to be ratified by the board by 30 August.A second phase outlining enforcement when the rules are broken will be approved by the end of the year, according to the board's plan.",23 May 2020,technology
Netflix stops charging customers who never watch,"Netflix says it will now start to cancel accounts that have watched nothing in more than a year, but have still been paying subscription fees.The streaming giant says hundreds of thousands of users fall into that ""inactive"" category - and it will now start suspending them.It said the move would save forgetful customers money.Netflix costs between £5.99 and £11.99 a month, and payment details are required to sign up.The company said the notifications would be sent to those people who signed up with a credit card or other payment method, but have not watched anything in the year since signing up.It will do the same for other users who have been paying for the service, but have not watched anything in the past two years.Users with dormant accounts will receive a notification asking if they want to continue with their subscription, and those who do not respond will have their account cancelled. Netflix said less than half a percent of its user-base falls into that category.“You know that sinking feeling when you realise you signed up for something but haven't used it in ages? At Netflix, the last thing we want is people paying for something they're not using,"" product innovation chief Eddy Wu said in a blog post. Affected account holders will receive a warning from Netflix in the form of an email before their accounts are deactivated. Notifications will start arriving this week.""We're asking everyone who has not watched anything on Netflix for a year since they joined to confirm they want to keep their membership,"" Mr Wu said.Netflix will retain viewing data from deactivated accounts, so if a user wants to re-subscribe at a later date they will be able to access their individualised preferences. The company has seen subscriber numbers surge this year, as lockdowns around the world keep people at home, where they want to be entertained.Almost 16 million people created accounts in the first three months of the year, nearly double the new sign-ups it saw in the final months of 2019.

Grandmother ordered to delete Facebook photos under GDPR,"A woman must delete photographs of her grandchildren that she posted on Facebook and Pinterest without their parents' permission, a court in the Netherlands has ruled.It ended up in court after a falling-out between the woman and her daughter.The judge ruled the matter was within the scope of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).One expert said the ruling reflected the ""position that the European Court has taken over many years"".The case went to court after the woman refused to delete photographs of her grandchildren which she had posted on social media.The mother of the children had asked several times for the pictures to be deleted.The GDPR does not apply to the ""purely personal"" or ""household"" processing of data.However, that exemption did not apply because posting photographs on social media made them available to a wider audience, the ruling said.""With Facebook, it cannot be ruled out that placed photos may be distributed and may end up in the hands of third parties,"" it said.The woman must remove the photos or pay a fine of €50 (£45) for every day that she fails to comply with the order, up to a maximum fine of €1,000.If she posts more images of the children in the future, she will be fined an extra €50 a day.""I think the ruling will surprise a lot of people who probably don't think too much before they tweet or post photos,"" said Neil Brown, a technology lawyer at Decoded Legal.""Irrespective of the legal position, would it be reasonable for the people who've posted those photos to think, 'Well, he or she doesn't want them out there anymore'?""

Coronavirus: MPs demand answers on misinformation,"Twitter has begun labelling tweets that spread misinformation about Covid-19, including some from Mark Steele, who posts about links between 5G and coronavirus. But tweets from other 5G conspiracy theorists, such as David Icke, remain unchallenged.MPs have asked Google, Twitter and Facebook to return to Parliament to answer their questions about content.Only Facebook's head of global policy Monica Bickert has agreed to attend.Chairman of the DCMS (Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) select committee Julian Knight said MPs had been ""very disappointed"" by the standard of evidence given by the three firms about coronavirus misinformation at their last meeting.""The failure by Twitter, Facebook and Google to give adequate answers in writing to our outstanding questions have left me with no alternative but to recall them to Parliament,"" he said in a statement.It has specifically requested the attendance of Google's Ronan Harris, managing director of UK & Ireland and Dara Nasr, managing director of Twitter UK.The committee wants clarity on a range of issues including:In an interview with the BBC, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said the social network had removed a post from Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro that claimed there was a coronavirus cure, as well as content from groups claiming the rollout of the 5G network was a cause of the spread of the virus. It has also removed posts from the conspiracy theorist, David Icke, which Twitter has not done.Twitter recently introduced a labelling system on tweets that could potentially cause harm and promised that world leaders such as President Trump would not be above the rules.But its enforcement appears patchy, with some from 5G conspiracy theorists going unchallenged.It has sent the DCMS committee a document outlining what it is doing to fight misinformation. It states: ""Our aim with harmful Covid-19 misinformation is to rapidly identify and remove tweets that pose the greatest risk of causing harm."" Google has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.The first peak of viral misinformation appears to have passed - but whether that's down to decisions made by social media platforms is difficult to ascertain. Misinformation spreading online has evolved over the course of the pandemic and so have social media policies in a bid to keep up. In the past, elections or terror attacks have resulted in some localised change to policies about tackling misinformation. But the unprecedented threat of the pandemic, affecting people in countries across the globe in a matter of weeks, has left social media sites with little choice but to tighten regulations more quickly than ever before. It did take a number of weeks for platforms - operating with remote and reduced work forces - to get on top of that initial avalanche of dodgy medical tips and speculation.However, the adoption of stricter policies, especially when it comes to conspiracies that could cause harm, does appear to have been somewhat effective. Especially since false claims linking 5G to coronavirus or about vaccinations have dominated the misleading conversation online in recent weeks. But it's difficult to tell whether the slow-down of this ""infodemic"" is down to social media sites changing their policies - or just a case of timing. When messages tell you tanks will be rolling down your street and they never appear you start to get sceptical. So you might stop forwarding on those dodgy WhatsApps - even if WhatsApp hadn't made it a bit harder to do that. Plus there's the debate as to whether removing conspiracies is always effective. It often leads to cries of censorship or establishment cover-up. But nonetheless it does stem the spread to some extent. ",21 May 2020,technology
