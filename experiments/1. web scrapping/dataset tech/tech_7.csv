Coronavirus: Security flaws found in NHS contact-tracing app,"Wide-ranging security flaws have been flagged in the Covid-19 contact-tracing app being piloted in the Isle of Wight.The security researchers involved have warned the problems pose risks to users' privacy and could be abused to prevent contagion alerts being sent.GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) told the BBC it was already aware of most of the issues raised and is in the process of addressing them.But the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required.Specifically, they call for new legal protections to prevent officials using the data for purposes other than identifying those at risk of being infected, or holding on to it indefinitely.In addition, they suggest the NHS considers shifting from its current ""centralised"" model - where contact-matching happens on a computer server - to a ""decentralised"" version - where the matching instead happens on people's phones.""There can still be bugs and security vulnerabilities in either the decentralised or the centralised models,"" said Thinking Cybersecurity chief executive Dr Vanessa Teague.""But the big difference is that a decentralised solution wouldn't have a central server with the recent face-to-face contacts of every infected person.""So there's a much lower risk of that database being leaked or abused.""Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday a new law ""is not needed because the Data Protection Act will do the job"".And NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has said using the centralised model will both make it easier to improve the app over time and trigger alerts based on people's self-diagnosed symptoms rather than just medical test results.The researchers detail seven different problems they found with the app.They include:""The risks overall are varied,"" Dr Chris Culnane, the second author of the report, told BBC News.""In terms of the registration issues, it's fairly low risk because it would require an attack against a well protected server, which we don't think is particularly likely.""But the risk about the unencrypted data is higher, because if someone was to get access to your phone, then they might be able to learn some additional information because of what is stored on that.""NCSC technical director Ian Levy blogged thanking the two researchers for their work and promising to address the issues they identified.But he said it might take several releases of the app before all the problems were addressed.""Everything reported to the team will be properly triaged (although this is taking longer than normal),"" he wrote.An NCSC spokesman said: ""It was always hoped that measures such as releasing the code and explaining decisions behind the app would generate meaningful discussion with the security and privacy community. ""We look forward to continuing to work with security and cryptography researchers to make the app the best it can be.""But Dr Culnane said politicians also needed to revisit the issue. ""I have confidence that they will fix the technical issues,"" he said.""But there are broader issues around the lack of legislation protecting use of this data [including the fact] there's no strict limit on when the data has to be deleted. ""That's in contrast to Australia, which has very strict limits about deleting its app data at the end of the crisis.""Meanwhile, Harriet Harman, who chairs the Parliament's Human Rights Committee, announced she was seeking permission to introduce a private member's bill to limit who could use data gathered by the app and how and create a watchdog to deal with related complaints from the public.""I personally would download the app myself, even if I'm apprehensive about what the data would be used for,"" the Labour MP told BBC News.""But the view of my committee was that this app should not go ahead unless [the government] is willing to put in place the privacy protections.""",19 May 2020,technology
Facebook Shops: Online stores open on Facebook and Instagram,"Nearly a million businesses in the UK and around the world can now set up a single online store to sell products, with no fee, on Facebook and Instagram.The initial stage of the Facebook Shops rollout has been brought forward and extended because of Covid-19.The stores will appear on business pages, Instagram profiles and through targeted ads.The company has already used a no-fees approach in its Facebook Marketplace for personal classifieds.""It's bigger than usual just because we want to make sure we're moving quickly to get these tools in the hands of as many businesses wherever they are, big or small, to help them survive during this time,"" Facebook's Layla Amjadi said.And product manager George Lee said it had been in the pipeline for at least half a year. ""Obviously, given the current situation, we have accelerated a lot of our efforts,"" he said.""We're in a unique position to be able to contribute to the survival of a bunch of these businesses."" The shopping feature will also eventually appear on WhatsApp and the company's other messaging apps and integrate with live streams.For the average Facebook user, ""this will be a really seamless experience,"" Ms Amjadi said. ""You can go much deeper now without having to leave the app.""Once a buyer decides they want to spend money, they will usually be directed to the company's website to complete the transaction.And if problems arise or a buyer wants to ask questions, they can do so through Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram Direct messages, some of which are already used by companies for that purpose.The rollout is part of a wider range of changes planned for shopping across Facebook's products, including:Anthony Ha, a senior writer at technology news site TechCrunch, said the pandemic lockdown may have worked in Facebook's favour.""After all, if your favourite store has changed their hours, or switched to online delivery or kerb-side pickup, they've almost certainly posted about it on Facebook or Instagram,"" he said.""So it makes sense for Facebook to make the purchase process as easy as possible from those profiles.""From a business perspective, the obvious goal is to drive more advertising. ""But it's also worth remembering that the pandemic's economic fallout will likely kill off many small business - including the ones that post and advertise on Facebook. ""So the company has a stake in helping those businesses survive in any way it can.""",19 May 2020,technology
EasyJet admits data of nine million hacked,"EasyJet has admitted that a ""highly sophisticated cyber-attack"" has affected approximately nine million customers.It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2,208 customers had also had their credit card details ""accessed"".The firm has informed the UK's Information Commissioner's Office while it investigates the breach.EasyJet first became aware of the attack in January.It told the BBC that it was only able to notify customers whose credit card details were stolen in early April.""This was a highly sophisticated attacker. It took time to understand the scope of the attack and to identify who had been impacted,"" the airline told the BBC.""We could only inform people once the investigation had progressed enough that we were able to identify whether any individuals have been affected, then who had been impacted and what information had been accessed.""Stolen credit card data included the three digital security code - known as the CVV number - on the back of the card itself.EasyJet added that it had gone public now in order to warn the nine million customers whose email addresses had been stolen to be wary of phishing attacks. It said that it would notify everyone affected by 26 May.It did not provide details about the nature of the attack or the motives, but said its investigation suggested hackers were targeting ""company intellectual property"" rather than information that could be used in identity theft.""There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused, however, on the recommendation of the ICO, we are communicating with the approximately nine million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing.""We are advising customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from EasyJet or EasyJet Holidays.""In response to the breach, the ICO  said that it was investigating.""People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly. When that doesn't happen, we will investigate and take robust action where necessary.""It also warned people to be on the lookout for phishing attacks and directed them to its advice on its website on how to spot such scams.Phishing attempts - which see criminals sending emails with links to fake web pages that steal personal data - have risen exponentially during the coronavirus crisis. Google is blocking more than 100 million phishing emails every day to Gmail users.It is likely that hackers will take advantage of the fact people are cancelling flights because of the uncertainty related to the spread of Covid-19, said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy.""Anybody who has ever purchased an EasyJet flight is advised to be extremely wary when opening emails from now on,"" he said.""Phishing emails that leverage data stolen during the attack could be used as an attack vector at any point in the future. ""As a result, it is important for customers to be vigilant whenever they receive unsolicited emails or emails that appear to be from EasyJet, as these could be fake emails which link to cloned websites designed to steal your data.""The coronavirus pandemic has meant an end to much global travel, leaving airlines struggling financially.""These are already turbulent times for all companies within the aviation industry but the situation has just got significantly worse for EasyJet,"" said Mike Fenton, chief executive of threat detection firm Redscan.""To add to the company's woes, it is now has to explain how the personal records of nine million customers were able to be accessed.""When it comes to cyber security, the airline industry doesn't have a great record. The British Airways breach in 2018 should have been a wake-up call and passenger confidence is likely to be at an all-time low after this.""British Airways announced that the personal details of more than half a million of its customers had been harvested by hackers in September 2018. Initially it said that only 380,000 transactions were affected and that the data did not include travel or passport details.The ICO later issued a record £183m fine over the breach. Compensation pay-outs to customers could see that reach £3bn.Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), if EasyJet is found to have mishandled customer data, it could face fines of up to 4% of its annual worldwide turnover.""It is impossible to determine yet whether or not there has been negligence but, if so, consumers could be eligible to claim compensation, raising the financial penalty imposed on the airline significantly,"" said lawyer Aman Johal.Millions of EasyJet customers' details of some sort or another have been accessed by hackers - but even more people now need to be vigilant.Generally, personal details can be used by fraudsters to access bank accounts, open accounts and take out loans in the innocent victims' names, make fraudulent purchases, or sell on to other criminals.The risks to those whose card details have been compromised are clear. Their provider should already have stopped the card, a new one will be issued, and they will need to sort out any regular payments coming from that card.Following a similar data breach at British Airways in 2018, some found this a frustrating and time-consuming task.Millions of people whose email addresses and travel details have been accessed will need to change passwords, and be wary of any unexpected transactions.Everyone else, particularly EasyJet customers whose details have not been affected, must be alert to other unsolicited emails and messages. Fraudsters will no doubt pose as EasyJet, banks, or the authorities and claim to be dealing with this latest breach. They are simply trying to steal personal details themselves.Are you an EasyJet customer? Have you been a victim of the cyber-attack?

My Little Pony-inspired game headlines tournament,"An unlikely fighting game Them's Fightin' Herds, which was inspired by the children's cartoon My Little Pony, has been chosen as one of the main games for a big gaming tournament.Evolution Championship Series (Evo) is normally held in Las Vegas but has had to ""go virtual"" due to the coronavirus pandemic.The game was selected partly because its coding allows for a smoother online gaming experience.There was a mixed reaction from gamers.Some were unimpressed that they were being asked to play a game competitively that was based on characters more usually favoured by young children.Others were more forgiving.Writing about it on news chat site Reddit, one player said: ""It's a smaller indie production, so the character roster isn't huge, but mechanics-wise it's an absolutely legit fighter with serious tournament chops... if you have any interest in fighting games, you can't go wrong with TFH. It's not just a cartoon animal gimmick game.""The title is based in a world known as Foenum, and features six characters competing against each other to find a champion worthy of gaining a magical key that will protect their world from carnivorous beasts known as the Predators.It began life as an unofficial fan-made title using characters from the TV show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.But developer Mane6 was sent a cease-and-desist order by series rights holder Hasbro, telling them they could not use the characters.Lauren Faust, the cartoonist and the creative director intervened and created an entirely new animal kingdom for the game, which featured an alpaca, deer, sheep, dragon, cow and a unicorn.One of the main reasons the game has been selected for Evo is its ""netcode"", a term that refers to how well gamers can connect to each other or a central server.Other games selected for the tournament, which takes place in July, are Mortal Kombat 11, Killer Instinct and Skullgirls.",19 May 2020,technology

Coronavirus: Security flaws found in NHS contact-tracing app,"Wide-ranging security flaws have been flagged in the Covid-19 contact-tracing app being piloted in the Isle of Wight.The security researchers involved have warned the problems pose risks to users' privacy and could be abused to prevent contagion alerts being sent.GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) told the BBC it was already aware of most of the issues raised and is in the process of addressing them.But the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required.Specifically, they call for new legal protections to prevent officials using the data for purposes other than identifying those at risk of being infected, or holding on to it indefinitely.In addition, they suggest the NHS considers shifting from its current ""centralised"" model - where contact-matching happens on a computer server - to a ""decentralised"" version - where the matching instead happens on people's phones.""There can still be bugs and security vulnerabilities in either the decentralised or the centralised models,"" said Thinking Cybersecurity chief executive Dr Vanessa Teague.""But the big difference is that a decentralised solution wouldn't have a central server with the recent face-to-face contacts of every infected person.""So there's a much lower risk of that database being leaked or abused.""Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday a new law ""is not needed because the Data Protection Act will do the job"".And NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has said using the centralised model will both make it easier to improve the app over time and trigger alerts based on people's self-diagnosed symptoms rather than just medical test results.The researchers detail seven different problems they found with the app.They include:""The risks overall are varied,"" Dr Chris Culnane, the second author of the report, told BBC News.""In terms of the registration issues, it's fairly low risk because it would require an attack against a well protected server, which we don't think is particularly likely.""But the risk about the unencrypted data is higher, because if someone was to get access to your phone, then they might be able to learn some additional information because of what is stored on that.""NCSC technical director Ian Levy blogged thanking the two researchers for their work and promising to address the issues they identified.But he said it might take several releases of the app before all the problems were addressed.""Everything reported to the team will be properly triaged (although this is taking longer than normal),"" he wrote.An NCSC spokesman said: ""It was always hoped that measures such as releasing the code and explaining decisions behind the app would generate meaningful discussion with the security and privacy community.

Disney's head of streaming to become CEO of TikTok,"Disney's head of streaming Kevin Mayer is stepping down to become the boss of social media platform TikTok.He has been named the chief executive officer of TikTok and chief operating officer of ByteDance, the platform's Chinese parent company.TikTok, an app where users post short videos, has seen an explosion of growth since its US launch.But that increased popularity has led to scrutiny by the US government over its ties to China.Mr Mayer will be responsible for ByteDance's ""global development"" including emerging business, gaming and music.""I'm excited to help lead the next phase of ByteDance's journey as the company continues to expand its breadth of products across every region of the world,"" Mr Mayer said in the release.He will be the first CEO of TikTok. TikTok has been downloaded more than 2 billion times on iOS and Android since it was launched globally in 2017.  The app allows users to make videos up to 15-seconds long with music in the background.The coronavirus pandemic has helped boost its popularity further with many users making comical or musical videos of their quarantine experiences.But having a Chinese parent company has worried US politicians. Some of them have raised concerns about ByteDance allowing Chinese government censorship or data collection on TikTok users. Both are charges ByteDance denies.At Disney, Mr Mayer oversaw the successful launch of the firms streaming service, Disney Plus in November of 2019. The service had over 54 million subscribers by May. He also managed the firms other streaming investments including Hulu, Hotstar, and sports streaming services ESPN plus.He was also considered a key figure in the company's acquisitions of Lucasfilm, Pixar and Marvel.  Before Disney's former chief executive Bob Iger stepped down from that role in February, Mr Mayer was viewed as a possible candidate to replace him. However, the role was given to Bob Chapek, head of parks, experiences and products.Mr Mayer will be joining ByteDance on 1 June.  ",19 May 2020,technology
Universities' move online 'must be done the right way',"Harry Ashworth should be in the final term of his first year at Oxford University, studying music. Instead he is stuck at his parents' house in south London hunched over a laptop, listening to lectures via Zoom.He doesn't feel that the sudden and dramatic change in circumstances has affected his learning too much, but he is missing some aspects of university life.""I am in a jazz orchestra and that isn't really happening now. And I would have been playing at the summer balls, so there are social events that I've missed.""Some of his more practical lessons have also been curtailed.Academically he feels less motivated ""which makes me less stressed but also flatter"".""Psychologically when you are at home it is different. When I am in my tutor's office I feel a bit more inspired.""Along with students around the world, Harry is getting used to the realities of online learning as part of the global lockdowns in response to the coronavirus pandemic.The fact that institutions have shifted to a digital model in a matter of weeks is impressive, thinks Kathryn Skelton, chief transformation officer at FutureLearn, an online learning platform owned by the Open University.Universities have ""moved Heaven and Earth"" to get to where they are now but still she says that ""her heart sinks"" when people think that delivering lectures via Zoom is enough.""Educators need to take a step back and ask not 'how can I replicate what I do in the classroom', but 'how can I redesign this learning experience to take advantage of a whole wealth of technology that can deliver a full learning experience - not just the delivery of information?'""Her tips include:Shai Reshef, president of online-only University of the People (UofPeople) agrees.""Lots of universities have shut down and asked professors to move lectures online and I think that many more universities should actually go in this direction, but they need to do it the right way. Don't have professors speaking for two hours. Adopt the entire pedagogy of online learning.""At UofPeople that involves daily small classes with a lot of interaction between students.Students who are refugees, or others who could never afford a traditional university education, are set weekly homework and assignment tasks. The eight-week modular courses are tuition-free and students pay only to sit the end-of-course exams. A year's worth of tuition costs $1,000 (£824).UofPeople has seen a huge rise in numbers, with 7,000 new students coming online for the new term.""A lot are coming to us because of the pandemic. We have students in quarantine who feel the best way to spend their time is going back to school. We have students whose schools have shut down, and they come to us to continue their studies, and they may go back to their schools when they reopen.""And we have a lot of people who have been laid off and realise that in order to get another job they need to study to change career.""FutureLearn has also seen demand for online courses rise more than threefold. Like UofPeople there is interest in learning new business skills. It has also seen a rise in interest in English language courses, mental health awareness such as mindfulness, and even courses designed to increase people's knowledge of coronavirus.If there is a silver lining to this crisis it is that more people will try out online learning, thinks Ms Skelton.""That traditional model of 18-to-21 year-olds who go to university, live in halls, is simply not feasible for a lot of people - those with caring responsibilities or those with financial restraints.""Once the pandemic is over, Mr Reshef thinks universities should consider a hybrid of online and traditional education, with the first year spent learning online and the next two in school.""It is not clear that universities will be open next year, and even if they are open they will have to have social distancing measures. Online is there and can continue to function seamlessly,"" he said.Online learning has had a mixed history. So-called Moocs (massive open online courses) were seen as revolutionary when they were first introduced, but retention rates are low. According to a study by MIT, the courses had a dropout rate of about 96% on average over five years.For students hoping to begin a traditional university journey in the autumn, there is still a great deal of uncertainty.Manchester University has already decided to deliver the bulk of its learning online in the autumn term, and similar discussions are going on in universities around the UK and beyond.  But for some courses, such as medicine, online-only will be tricky.Holly Leedham has just turned 18, and was looking forward to starting a new chapter of life at Liverpool University in the autumn, studying law with accounting. Now that has been thrown into doubt.""I would be really disappointed as the experience of making friends wouldn't be there. I think us having to pay full tuition fees and being at home isn't fair either, and I'd hope that would be reduced somehow.""But she said joining the university - even if it was online  - would be better than deferring.""I may as well be at uni while the world recovers from what I imagine to be a frightening recession.""Ellie Yeomans, who had hoped to study Sports Management at Nottingham Trent University, is similarly pragmatic.""I am assuming that the first term may be online and that would be gutting for everyone, but I think everyone just has to get on with it.""",17 May 2020,technology

The shopping feature will also eventually appear on WhatsApp and the company's other messaging apps and integrate with live streams.For the average Facebook user, ""this will be a really seamless experience,"" Ms Amjadi said. ""You can go much deeper now without having to leave the app.""Once a buyer decides they want to spend money, they will usually be directed to the company's website to complete the transaction.And if problems arise or a buyer wants to ask questions, they can do so through Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram Direct messages, some of which are already used by companies for that purpose.The rollout is part of a wider range of changes planned for shopping across Facebook's products, including:Anthony Ha, a senior writer at technology news site TechCrunch, said the pandemic lockdown may have worked in Facebook's favour.""After all, if your favourite store has changed their hours, or switched to online delivery or kerb-side pickup, they've almost certainly posted about it on Facebook or Instagram,"" he said.""So it makes sense for Facebook to make the purchase process as easy as possible from those profiles.""From a business perspective, the obvious goal is to drive more advertising. ""But it's also worth remembering that the pandemic's economic fallout will likely kill off many small business - including the ones that post and advertise on Facebook. ""So the company has a stake in helping those businesses survive in any way it can.""",19 May 2020,technology
EasyJet admits data of nine million hacked,"EasyJet has admitted that a ""highly sophisticated cyber-attack"" has affected approximately nine million customers.It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2,208 customers had also had their credit card details ""accessed"".The firm has informed the UK's Information Commissioner's Office while it investigates the breach.EasyJet first became aware of the attack in January.It told the BBC that it was only able to notify customers whose credit card details were stolen in early April.""This was a highly sophisticated attacker. It took time to understand the scope of the attack and to identify who had been impacted,"" the airline told the BBC.""We could only inform people once the investigation had progressed enough that we were able to identify whether any individuals have been affected, then who had been impacted and what information had been accessed.""Stolen credit card data included the three digital security code - known as the CVV number - on the back of the card itself.EasyJet added that it had gone public now in order to warn the nine million customers whose email addresses had been stolen to be wary of phishing attacks. It said that it would notify everyone affected by 26 May.It did not provide details about the nature of the attack or the motives, but said its investigation suggested hackers were targeting ""company intellectual property"" rather than information that could be used in identity theft.""There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused, however, on the recommendation of the ICO, we are communicating with the approximately nine million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing.""We are advising customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from EasyJet or EasyJet Holidays.""In response to the breach, the ICO  said that it was investigating.""People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly. When that doesn't happen, we will investigate and take robust action where necessary.""It also warned people to be on the lookout for phishing attacks and directed them to its advice on its website on how to spot such scams.Phishing attempts - which see criminals sending emails with links to fake web pages that steal personal data - have risen exponentially during the coronavirus crisis. Google is blocking more than 100 million phishing emails every day to Gmail users.It is likely that hackers will take advantage of the fact people are cancelling flights because of the uncertainty related to the spread of Covid-19, said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy.""Anybody who has ever purchased an EasyJet flight is advised to be extremely wary when opening emails from now on,"" he said.""Phishing emails that leverage data stolen during the attack could be used as an attack vector at any point in the future. ""As a result, it is important for customers to be vigilant whenever they receive unsolicited emails or emails that appear to be from EasyJet, as these could be fake emails which link to cloned websites designed to steal your data.""The coronavirus pandemic has meant an end to much global travel, leaving airlines struggling financially.""These are already turbulent times for all companies within the aviation industry but the situation has just got significantly worse for EasyJet,"" said Mike Fenton, chief executive of threat detection firm Redscan.""To add to the company's woes, it is now has to explain how the personal records of nine million customers were able to be accessed.""When it comes to cyber security, the airline industry doesn't have a great record. The British Airways breach in 2018 should have been a wake-up call and passenger confidence is likely to be at an all-time low after this.""British Airways announced that the personal details of more than half a million of its customers had been harvested by hackers in September 2018. Initially it said that only 380,000 transactions were affected and that the data did not include travel or passport details.The ICO later issued a record £183m fine over the breach. Compensation pay-outs to customers could see that reach £3bn.Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), if EasyJet is found to have mishandled customer data, it could face fines of up to 4% of its annual worldwide turnover.""It is impossible to determine yet whether or not there has been negligence but, if so, consumers could be eligible to claim compensation, raising the financial penalty imposed on the airline significantly,"" said lawyer Aman Johal.Millions of EasyJet customers' details of some sort or another have been accessed by hackers - but even more people now need to be vigilant.Generally, personal details can be used by fraudsters to access bank accounts, open accounts and take out loans in the innocent victims' names, make fraudulent purchases, or sell on to other criminals.The risks to those whose card details have been compromised are clear. Their provider should already have stopped the card, a new one will be issued, and they will need to sort out any regular payments coming from that card.Following a similar data breach at British Airways in 2018, some found this a frustrating and time-consuming task.Millions of people whose email addresses and travel details have been accessed will need to change passwords, and be wary of any unexpected transactions.Everyone else, particularly EasyJet customers whose details have not been affected, must be alert to other unsolicited emails and messages. Fraudsters will no doubt pose as EasyJet, banks, or the authorities and claim to be dealing with this latest breach. They are simply trying to steal personal details themselves.Are you an EasyJet customer? Have you been a victim of the cyber-attack?

My Little Pony-inspired game headlines tournament,"An unlikely fighting game Them's Fightin' Herds, which was inspired by the children's cartoon My Little Pony, has been chosen as one of the main games for a big gaming tournament.Evolution Championship Series (Evo) is normally held in Las Vegas but has had to ""go virtual"" due to the coronavirus pandemic.The game was selected partly because its coding allows for a smoother online gaming experience.There was a mixed reaction from gamers.Some were unimpressed that they were being asked to play a game competitively that was based on characters more usually favoured by young children.Others were more forgiving.Writing about it on news chat site Reddit, one player said: ""It's a smaller indie production, so the character roster isn't huge, but mechanics-wise it's an absolutely legit fighter with serious tournament chops... if you have any interest in fighting games, you can't go wrong with TFH. It's not just a cartoon animal gimmick game.""The title is based in a world known as Foenum, and features six characters competing against each other to find a champion worthy of gaining a magical key that will protect their world from carnivorous beasts known as the Predators.It began life as an unofficial fan-made title using characters from the TV show My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.But developer Mane6 was sent a cease-and-desist order by series rights holder Hasbro, telling them they could not use the characters.Lauren Faust, the cartoonist and the creative director intervened and created an entirely new animal kingdom for the game, which featured an alpaca, deer, sheep, dragon, cow and a unicorn.One of the main reasons the game has been selected for Evo is its ""netcode"", a term that refers to how well gamers can connect to each other or a central server.Other games selected for the tournament, which takes place in July, are Mortal Kombat 11, Killer Instinct and Skullgirls.",19 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Security flaws found in NHS contact-tracing app,"Wide-ranging security flaws have been flagged in the Covid-19 contact-tracing app being piloted in the Isle of Wight.The security researchers involved have warned the problems pose risks to users' privacy and could be abused to prevent contagion alerts being sent.GCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) told the BBC it was already aware of most of the issues raised and is in the process of addressing them.But the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required.Specifically, they call for new legal protections to prevent officials using the data for purposes other than identifying those at risk of being infected, or holding on to it indefinitely.In addition, they suggest the NHS considers shifting from its current ""centralised"" model - where contact-matching happens on a computer server - to a ""decentralised"" version - where the matching instead happens on people's phones.""There can still be bugs and security vulnerabilities in either the decentralised or the centralised models,"" said Thinking Cybersecurity chief executive Dr Vanessa Teague.""But the big difference is that a decentralised solution wouldn't have a central server with the recent face-to-face contacts of every infected person.""So there's a much lower risk of that database being leaked or abused.""Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday a new law ""is not needed because the Data Protection Act will do the job"".And NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has said using the centralised model will both make it easier to improve the app over time and trigger alerts based on people's self-diagnosed symptoms rather than just medical test results.The researchers detail seven different problems they found with the app.They include:""The risks overall are varied,"" Dr Chris Culnane, the second author of the report, told BBC News.""In terms of the registration issues, it's fairly low risk because it would require an attack against a well protected server, which we don't think is particularly likely.""But the risk about the unencrypted data is higher, because if someone was to get access to your phone, then they might be able to learn some additional information because of what is stored on that.""NCSC technical director Ian Levy blogged thanking the two researchers for their work and promising to address the issues they identified.But he said it might take several releases of the app before all the problems were addressed.""Everything reported to the team will be properly triaged (although this is taking longer than normal),"" he wrote.An NCSC spokesman said: ""It was always hoped that measures such as releasing the code and explaining decisions behind the app would generate meaningful discussion with the security and privacy community. ""We look forward to continuing to work with security and cryptography researchers to make the app the best it can be.""But Dr Culnane said politicians also needed to revisit the issue. ""I have confidence that they will fix the technical issues,"" he said.""But there are broader issues around the lack of legislation protecting use of this data [including the fact] there's no strict limit on when the data has to be deleted. ""That's in contrast to Australia, which has very strict limits about deleting its app data at the end of the crisis.""Meanwhile, Harriet Harman, who chairs the Parliament's Human Rights Committee, announced she was seeking permission to introduce a private member's bill to limit who could use data gathered by the app and how and create a watchdog to deal with related complaints from the public.""I personally would download the app myself, even if I'm apprehensive about what the data would be used for,"" the Labour MP told BBC News.""But the view of my committee was that this app should not go ahead unless [the government] is willing to put in place the privacy protections.""",19 May 2020,technology
