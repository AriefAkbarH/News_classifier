Facebook dominates cases of recorded social media grooming,"Police in England and Wales recorded more than 10,000 online grooming offences on social media over two-and-a-half years.Where the method was recorded, more than half - 55% - took place on a Facebook-owned app.The figures come from freedom of information requests lodged by child protection charity the NSPCC. It is calling for the government to introduce stronger protections, warning that the rate of offences is rising.Just under a quarter of recorded offences - 23% - took place in the six months to October last year, the most recent period for which data is available.The data covers the first 30 months since the introduction of a law that made sexual communication with a child an explicit offence. In that time, police in the two nations recorded 10,119 offences. But police only recorded the platform used in 5,784 of those cases.Of those, more than half took place on a Facebook platform - including Facebook itself, its messenger app, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Instagram was the most common method among the Facebook-owned app, with 1,630 recorded offences - 16% of the total. Of 5,784 reports where the method of communication was recorded by policeThe NSPCC has previously warned that Facebook's shift to tightly encrypted messaging would aid offenders, and shareholders recently tried to block its plans for encryption on that basis.A Facebook spokesperson said: ""There is no place for grooming or child exploitation on our platforms, and we use technology to proactively find and quickly remove it.""We have a content and security team of over 35,000 people investigating reports from our community and working to keep our platforms safe. Our teams also work closely with child protection experts and law enforcement, reporting content directly to specialists.""Another 1,060 offences (18%) were recorded as taking place on Snapchat, owned by Snap Inc. It also said the exploitation of young people is absolutely unacceptable, and that eliminating such abuse was a priority for the company. The rest of the cases were made up of small numbers of cases across dozens of other platforms such as text messaging, online gaming, or websites.Because the data begins in early 2017 and runs to October 2019, it may not account for the most recent trends in platforms that young people use.The NSPCC says its information demonstrates the need for new regulation, and warned that the coronavirus lockdown had created ""a perfect storm for abusers"".It is calling for the government to push ahead with the proposed Online Harms Bill within 18 months.NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground in which to groom our kids.""Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.""",29 May 2020,technology
Glastonbury Council plays down link to 'anti-5G' device,"A council has distanced itself from a device that claims to protect against 5G but which has now been dubbed a scam.The USB stick was cited in a report prepared by Glastonbury Town Council, calling for a UK government inquiry into the health effects of 5G networks.A security expert who took the device apart said it appeared to be a normal USB stick.The Somerset council says it has never recommended use of the device.In a statement on its website, the council said: ""Glastonbury Town Council does not, and has never recommended or endorsed the 5GBioShield or any other anti-5G devices offering protection against the supposed negative health effects of fifth-generation cellular network technology"".It made reference to the BBC's article but said the recommendation was from ""a member of the public"" and did not represent the ""official policy"" of the council.The 5GBioShield was recommended by Toby Hall, a member of the council's 5G advisory committee, who said he found use of the device ""helpful"".But a security expert who took the device apart said it appeared to be a normal USB stick.Tradings Standards is now seeking to halt sales of the £339 device, which it called a ""scam"".An executive summary of a report compiled by the council and recommending that the government and Public Health England conduct their own studies into the safety of 5G networks, remains on the council's website.But technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, who led the BBC investigation, tweeted that the full report has been removed.https://t.co/P8UyLp7XhK Glastonbury Town Council issues statement saying its 5G report never recommended the 5G BioShield - but takes down full report in which one external member did make such a recommendation pic.twitter.com/UgDjlt4ekLEnd of Twitter post  by @ruskin147Scientists have said that the is no evidence that mobile networks cause cancer or other illnesses.",29 May 2020,technology

Uber destroys thousands of bikes and scooters,"Uber is destroying thousands of electric bikes and scooters, after selling its Jump business to Lime.Videos of its red bikes being crushed at a US recycling centre were shared on social media, angering cycling advocates.Uber said it had decided to destroy thousands of its older-model vehicles due to maintenance, liability and safety concerns.In the UK, Uber continues to operate Jump and has not scrapped any bikes.A spokesman told the BBC the sale of Jump to Lime had not been completed in Europe, and that Jump continued to operate ""as normal"" in London.In 2018, Uber said it would focus more on its electric bike and scooter business than on cars.But on 7 May this year, Uber announced a deal that saw Lime take over the Jump bike business.As part of the deal, Uber invested $170m (£139m) in Lime, while Lime acquired ""tens of thousands"" of Uber's Jump bikes - and the associated intellectual property.Lime's chief executive Wayne Ting has said he prefers the design of Uber's bikes and will deploy more of them in the future.However, there were also ""tens of thousands"" of older-model bikes that Lime did not inherit as part of the deal.Videos shared on Twitter show the bikes arriving at a recycling facility in North Carolina to be destroyed.Disappointed charities and organisations suggested the bikes could have been donated to community groups, or sold to individuals to boost the uptake of electric bikes.""Why not at least peel the decals [branding] off and sell the bikes to individuals?"" Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, a non-profit group, told news site Motherboard.""We explored donating the remaining, older-model bikes,"" Uber said in a statement.""But given many significant issues - including maintenance, liability, safety concerns, and a lack of consumer-grade charging equipment - we decided the best approach was to responsibly recycle them.""",28 May 2020,technology
Trading Standards squad targets anti-5G USB stick,"Trading Standards officers are seeking to halt sales of a device that has been claimed to offer protection against the supposed dangers of 5G via use of quantum technology.Cyber-security experts say the £339 5GBioShield appears to no more than a basic USB drive.""We consider it to be a scam,"" Stephen Knight, operations director for London Trading Standards told the BBC.His said his team is working with City of London Police's Action Fraud squad.They are seeking a court order to take down the company's website.""People who are vulnerable need protection from this kind of unscrupulous trading,"" he added.The intervention follows an examination of the device, which was first reported by the BBC.The vendor - BioShield Distribution - had previously said the device was backed by ""research"", but has not responded to the latest development.The rollout of the new 5G mobile networks began in the UK only last summer and has not yet reached outside urban areas. Yet across the country there is already a cottage industry offering protection against the supposed negative health effects, even though they have been dismissed by regulators and mainstream scientists.The 5GBioShield was recommended by a member of Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee, which has called for an inquiry into 5G. One of nine external members, Toby Hall, said: ""We use this device and find it helpful,"" and provided a link to its website, which describes it as a USB key that ""provides protection for  your home and family, thanks to the wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser, which can be worn or placed near to a smartphone or any other electrical, radiation or EMF [electromagnetic field] emitting device"".""Through a process of quantum oscillation, the 5GBioShield USB key balances and re-harmonises the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wi-fi, tablets, et cetera,"" it adds.Each of these USB keys costs £339.60 including VAT, though there is a special offer of three for £958.80.But, at first sight, it seems to be just that - a USB key, with just 128MB of storage.""So what's different between it and a virtually identical 'crystal' USB key available from various suppliers in Shenzhen, China, for around £5 per key?"" asks Ken Munro, whose company, Pen Test Partners, specialises in taking apart consumer electronic products to spot security vulnerabilities.And the answer appears to be a circular sticker. ""Now, we're not 5G quantum experts but said sticker looks remarkably like one available in sheets from stationery suppliers for less than a penny each,"" he says.Mr Munro and his colleague Phil Eveleigh proceeded to dismantle the USB key to find out if there were any whizz-bang electronics inside. But all they found was an LED light on the circuit board, similar to those on any other USB key.Their conclusion was that trading standards bodies should carry out their own investigations.A search in Companies House shows the two directors of BioShield Distribution are Anna Grochowalska and Valerio Laghezza. Both of them appear to have been involved previously in a business called Immortalis, which sells a dietary supplement called Klotho Formula. Its website - rather similar in design to that of the BioShield - says Klotho Formula uses a ""proprietary procedure that leads to relativistic time dilation and biological quantum entanglement at the DNA level"".Ms Grochowalska told BBC News her company was the sole global distributor of the 5GBioShield -  but it did not manufacture or own the product. ""We are in possession of a great deal of technical information, with plenty of back-up historical research,"" she said.""As you can understand, we are not authorised to fully disclose all this sensitive information to third parties, for obvious reasons.""And she rejected the suggestion selling a £5 product for more than £300 was unreasonable.""In regard to the costs analysis your research has produced, I believe that the lack of in-depth information will not drive you to the exact computation of our expenses and production costs, including the cost of IP [intellectual property rights], and so on,"" she said.""It is therefore hard to take your evaluation seriously, since you have evidently not researched the background facts in any meaningful way.""Mr Hall said his remarks in Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee report should not be seen as a recommendation to buy the product.But he had no regrets about buying it and since plugging it in had felt beneficial effects, including being able to sleep through the night and having more dreams. ""I also felt a 'calmer' feel to the home,"" he told BBC News.And he had thought the company might be able to develop a system that could offer protection to the whole town of Glastonbury against the effects of radiation from electromagnetic fields.It's worth noting though that the regulator Ofcom has published the results of EMF measurements at 16 sites, which were taken following the launch of 5G. It said that in each case, emissions were ""a small fraction"" of the levels deemed safe under international guidelines.",28 May 2020,technology
Huawei: What would happen if the UK ditched the Chinese firm?,"Huawei's future in the UK is in doubt - again.The consequences could affect how quickly improved internet access is rolled out and how much it will cost. This a time when the country's economy is already in a precarious state because of the coronavirus pandemic.The catalyst for a potential rethink is the US's move to restrict the firm's ability to buy chips, which was justified on ""national security grounds"".On Sunday, the UK's National Security Centre (NCSC) confirmed it was examining what impact this would have on the UK networks that use Huawei's tech.That sounds quite vague. But it potentially paves the way for a government U-turn.In January, the prime minister gave the green light to continued use of the firm's tech in mobile and broadband networks, but said its its market share must be reduced.Now he might appreciate the chance for change of mind.It would help Boris Johnson prevent backbenchers who favour a ban from derailing his forthcoming Telecoms Infrastructure Bill. Moreover, it offers him a way to defuse tensions with the White House, which has said continued use of Huawei will have a ""dramatic impact on our ability to share [security] information"".Mr Johnson and President Trump may meet next month at a mooted G7 summit. Blocking Huawei could help secure a post-Brexit trade deal, even if it made relations with China trickier.But the company warns there would be consequences.""More suppliers means greater competition, innovation and network reliability, and crucially ensures consumers have access to the best possible technology,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief, told the BBC.""Removing Huawei would seriously delay 5G, costing the British economy up to £7bn,"" he added, citing a study published last year by Mobile UK, a trade group that represents UK network operators.Part of the reason mobile providers are concerned is that the current version of 5G relies on new equipment being plugged into existing 4G kit from the same vendor.""A lot of the 4G expansion was software-upgradeable to do 5G when an extra mast antenna was fitted,"" explained Andrew Ferguson, editor-in-chief of the news site ThinkBroadband.So, he added, even if a Huawei ban was limited to the newer technology, networks would still have to rip out and replace some of their older infrastructure as well.""It's not only a very expensive process for the operators, but it's going to be a time-consuming one as well because they need to get access to all those sites to make the changes,"" added Matthew Howett from Assembly, the consultancy that wrote Mobile UK's report.""And Huawei has been very innovative at coming up with the smallest and lightest 5G equipment, meaning the operators can sometimes just use a cherry picker to hook it onto existing mast infrastructure. Some of the others' is heavier and bulkier, which can require more in terms of getting planning consent and road closures.""Huawei's major 5G rivals are Nokia and Ericsson - two European firms.The networks claim that having three providers to choose from helps them negotiate lower prices. In many cases, they want a mix of two suppliers so that if technical problems arise with one they can fall back on the other to provide a reduced service. That doesn't always involve Huawei - O2 for instance picked Nokia and Ericsson to be its primary 5G vendors despite having trialled the Chinese firm's kit.A study commissioned by Huawei last year claimed locking it out would increase a country's 5G investment costs by between 8% and 29% due to reduced competition.And if mobile providers have to spend more, consumers can expect their bills to rise too.But one MP opposed to Huawei's rollout says there are more important considerations.""There's a free and fair competition element here, there's a security element, there's a data-privacy element, and there's a sort of geopolitics of Chinese influence as well - the influence of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Bob Seely, a member of the foreign affairs committee, told the BBC.""There shouldn't on principle be high-risk vendors in the communications network.""Huawei denies it uses state subsidies to undercut its rivals, adding that it would never spy on China's behalf or otherwise deliberately compromise its clients.Huawei is also a big player in fixed-line broadband.It currently accounts for about 44% of the equipment used in providing super-fast full-fibre connections directly to homes, office and other buildings, according to UK regulator Ofcom.BT's Openreach division aims to bring that in line with a 35% government target by using more kit from Nokia and the US firm Adtran.But this sidesteps the fact that more properties rely on an alternative set-up in which fibre only reaches roadside cabinets, and the last leg is supplied by a copper-based connection. The reason this is relevant is that tens of thousands of the cabinets involved are Huawei's.""They connect directly to the core of the network,"" commented Mr Ferguson.""But replacing those is a complete non-starter unless someone's going to throw many billions of pounds at it and also all the people to do the work."" While Huawei's opponents would prefer it to be gone altogether, they acknowledge this is impractical in the short term.But Mr Seely suggested that cabinets and other such products should be swapped out for alternatives when they are ""up for replacement"".One thing practically everyone agrees on is that the matter needs to be settled once and for at a time when so much else about the economy is uncertain.""These procurement decisions can take 18 months to two years to finalise and it takes time to ramp up supply to meet the demand,"" said Mr Howett.""So this isn't just a question of overnight deciding not to use Huawei - it would take many years to do it properly.""",26 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Hairdressers offer virtual appointments in lockdown,"Hairdressers have been offering virtual appointments to help people style their hair at home.Stylists are using apps including FaceTime, Zoom, and YouTube to provide customers live one-to-one advice and tutorials.While salons have already reopened in France and Germany, hairdressers in the UK expect to remain closed until July.An industry report estimated the hair and beauty sector contributed £6.6bn to the country's economy last year.Paul Phillips owns Chopp Hair salon in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, which shut in March when the coronavirus lockdown began.He provides a service called Chopp Drops, in which he delivers hair products to customers’ doorsteps and then demonstrates via video call how to apply the treatment.“Most hairdressers say you should never colour your hair at home, and in normal times I’d agree,” he says. “But lots of clients’ mental health has been affected by the current situation, so sorting out grey roots and split ends makes them feel better.”Paul says he serves up to 26 clients a day, but adds that he is cautious to only offer advice that is achievable at home.“It’s too technical to dye blonde hair, so those clients sadly have to sit tight and wait for the lockdown to be over,” he explains. “You don’t want somebody to mess up and then have to live with it for another seven weeks.”Most of the hairdressers the BBC spoke to offered bespoke hair kits and virtual appointments priced between £30 and £150.Ebuni Ajiduah is a hair loss-specialist. She has also moved her appointments online, offering clients home treatments, and when required referring them to dermatologists for further advice. “People now have the time to focus on things they may have neglected,” she says, adding that she’s seen an increased demand for her services.Ebuni has also launched a Virtual Wash Day every Sunday, when she invites people to join her on Zoom to wash, treat, and style hair together.“We talk about the products we use and how we twist our hair,” she says. “It’s really nice, you get some people in shower caps and others trying to keep their kids still.“It gives people a sense of normalcy when the world is on fire - you can still have a routine and focus time on yourself.”Some hairdressers advise against cutting your own hair but are still offering other tips online.“I've trimmed mine at the front but even I wouldn't attempt [to cut] mine at the back,” Michael Van Clarke says in a video on Instagram. Instead, he proceeds to show the audience how to style short hair that has grown out over a few weeks.Since closing its doors, the team from his salon has been posting videos on social media and booking virtual colour consultations, serving more than 3,000 customers online.“We have new clients which have never even been to our salon, the demand is huge,” Mr Van Clarke says. “It’s a lot easier to do the video consultations if we’ve seen them in person before, but we are still able to give advice to new customers.”Senior technicians carry out a hair assessment over an initial video call, advise on treatments and products, send them out and then offer a follow-up consultation to observe and guide the client.“Some people like their hands held for reassurance, so our technicians can show them how to hold the brush and how long to leave colour on for,” Mr Van Clarke adds.Gina Conway, who runs three salons in London, thinks this could become the ""new normal"".“Even when lockdown is over, it’s going to be chaos,” she explains. “Some people might not be able to afford to go to the salon, they might be working from home or looking after children still, so I hope we can relieve that stress through technology.”Gina says she’s now pivoting to focus on the internet.“At first I was hesitant as I wanted to keep my business as professional as possible, but this is our way of giving proper advice and helping people to feel good about themselves.”",25 May 2020,technology
'Scorching-hot hacked computer burned my hand',"Bullets rained down from all angles but Abdelrhman Badr kept calm. Suddenly an enemy burst through a window. Abdelrhman swung round to face the soldier and save his team. He lined up his sights for a fatal shot and squeezed the trigger but… his screen went black. His computer had silently and suddenly shut itself down without warning.Abdelrhman was confused. The game he was playing had never caused problems before. He reached down and looked inside his computer, which he liked to leave open and on display in his bedroom.Instinctively he touched one of the components, swore and pulled his hand back. The graphics card was so hot it had burned his fingers.The 18-year-old from Sheffield hadn't realised it yet, but this minor injury was caused by crypto-jacking.Crypto-jacking is the unauthorised and illegal use of someone's computer to collect Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies. There are estimated to be more than 47 million crypto-currency users around the world, although it is difficult to be sure because of their anonymity. Users collect virtual coins by a complex process called ""mining"" which puts computers through a series of mathematical problems.In a crypto-jacking operation, hackers fool victims into downloading a malicious file that surreptitiously forces their computers to mine for this money and send it back to the criminals who can spend it on crypto-currency marketplaces or turn it into mainstream cash.Crypto-jacking attacks increase a victim's electricity bill and can not only slow down infected computers but potentially cause irreparable damage to hardware.Last week, at least a dozen supercomputers across Europe had to be shut down after hackers targeted them with crypto-jacking attacks.Abdelrhman Badr has no idea how hackers got into his system. He thinks he must have accidentally downloaded the malware three weeks before he burned his hand, when he started noticing strange things happening to his computer.""Whenever I put my PC to sleep the screens would go blank but I could still hear the fans running and when I came back to it, it would just open up to the main desktop with none of the usual login page or anything,"" he says. ""My computer wasn't actually going to sleep at all.""Even when he burned his hand, he didn't at first consider he was the victim of a hack.It was actually a mistake that led to his discovery.""I was playing around with a program that monitors computer activity and everything looked normal but I accidentally left it on overnight,"" he recalls.""When I next checked I found that my computer had been sending loads of information back to a strange website I've never visited or heard of.""The website was set up to collect the crypto-currency Monero. . ""I was shocked and also a bit embarrassed as I take pride in keeping my PC safe. It's really frustrating to know that there could be a program running without me knowing and some guy secretly mining crypto, destroying my hardware and stealing my electricity.""There could be hundreds, or even thousands of victims like Abdelrhman, who are unwittingly lining the digital wallet of this hacker or hackers. ""Crypto-jacking attacks are becoming more sophisticated, using techniques to hide their behaviour,"" says Alex Hinchliffe, a threat intelligence analyst at Palo Alto Networks.""Cyber-criminals look for as many victims' systems as possible. The more systems, whether it be PCs, servers, cloud services, mobile and other smart devices the better, as more mining can be achieved in a relatively benign and unobtrusive manner.""Experts say the threat of crypto-jacking rises and falls with the fluctuating price of crypto-currencies. According to research from Palo Alto Networks, the attacks are currently on the rise.""It's not as profitable as it used to be for hackers so crypto-miners are showing up in the weirdest places on the internet to maximise the number of victims. Sometimes we find them hidden inside the code of free programs, for example,"" adds Ryan Kalember from Proofpoint, another information security company.Security specialists say computer users should be vigilant and look out for changes to their computers, such as a slowing down of performance, or changed settings. It's also a good idea to install some security software and do regular virus scans.",30 May 2020,technology
