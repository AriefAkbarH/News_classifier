This month the platform introduced a new policy on misleading information amid the coronavirus pandemic.But recent posts in which Mr Trump - who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter - promoted a conspiracy theory about the death of political aide Lori Klausutis, blaming a high-profile critic, have not received the same treatment.The notification on Mr Trump's tweet shows a blue exclamation mark and a link suggesting readers ""get the facts about mail-in ballots"".It directs users to a page on which Mr Trump's claims are described as ""unsubstantiated"", citing reporting by CNN, the Washington Post and others.The pandemic is putting pressure on US states to expand the use of postal voting because people are worried about becoming infected at polling stations.In a ""what you need to know"" section, Twitter writes that Mr Trump ""falsely claimed mail-in ballots would lead to 'a Rigged Election'."" ""Fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud,"" it continues.The company had pledged to increase the use of warning labels about false or misleading information on its site, but has been slow to take steps against the US president.Mr Trump posted the same claim about mail-in ballots on Facebook, but it is not fact-checked on that platform.Mr Trump then accused Twitter of interfering in the US presidential election scheduled for 3 November 2020, saying the company was ""completely stifling free speech, and I, as president, will not allow it to happen"".His tweet on Wednesday told social media to ""clean up your act now"" and that he would not let a ""more sophisticated version"" of what they had ""attempted to do, and failed, in 2016"" happen again.

Now he may be in for a fight with the platform itself.Following the firm's decision to label his tweets as misleading, he claimed on Twitter that the company was stifling free speech and that he wouldn't allow it. But Twitter as a private company gets to set its own rules for what happens on its platform.The trouble for many was that up until Tuesday the firm didn't seem to be enforcing its rules when it came to the US president or other global leaders. This is not the first time President Trump has made claims on Twitter that some say would have had less powerful people blocked from the site. But Mr Trump's bombastic comments are part of what draws some of his followers to the site in the first place. The company doesn't want to lose them.It sees the new labelling system as a way to balance both the desire to allow Twitter users including the president to say what they like, while also giving readers protection against misleading claims. The strategy mostly worked with tweets about Covid-19.But with the US election in November, Twitter should expect a lot more posts with potentially misleading information. Meaning this is likely only the first test for its new enforcement plans.They are voting bulletins that are distributed and returned by post. In a recent opinion survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 66% of Americans said they would not be comfortable going to a polling place to cast their ballot during the coronavirus outbreak.Such concerns have increased pressure on states to expand the availability of mail-in ballots for all voters in order to minimise the risk of viral exposure from in-person voting.While every state provides some form of remote voting, the requirements to qualify vary greatly.Five states in the western US, including Washington, Oregon and Colorado, conduct their elections entirely via mail-in ballot. Others, like California, provide a postal ballot to anyone who requests it.On the other end of the spectrum, 17 states require voters to provide a valid reason why they are unable to vote in-person in order to qualify for an absentee ballot. The move comes on the heels of Twitter's decision not to remove a comment President Trump made about the death of Lori Klausutis in 2001. The president has tweeted several messages promoting a conspiracy theory that Ms Klausutis was murdered by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Her widower Timothy Klausutis asked Twitter to remove the post, saying it included ""horrifying lies"".The company told Mr Klausutis it was ""deeply sorry"" about the pain caused by the president's statements, but said the tweets did not violate their policies.",27 May 2020,technology

Sky Q kicks off HDR support starting with on-demand nature shows,"Sky has launched three new on-demand nature programmes featuring high dynamic range (HDR) for Sky Q customers.HDR offers a greater range of colours, making pictures more vivid and realistic than before.But Sky viewers will need a Sky Q 1TB or 2TB set-top box and a Sky Experience or Ultra HD subscription to see the difference. Previous reports had suggested Sky wouldn’t launch HDR until late 2020.It coincides with the launch of Sky’s new nature channel on Wednesday.The first programmes available on-demand with HDR will all be nature documentaries:Sky also confirmed that it planned to broadcast the 2021 Olympic Games live in HDR. Other programmes will offer HDR before the end of the current year, including movies.In December last year, it was reported that Sky had delayed the launch of its HDR service until “late 2020” so it was “a bit of a surprise” that it had become available today, said Becky Roberts of What Hi-Fi? magazine.“If you’ve got a compatible Sky Q box and a TV that supports HDR, it should be as simple as turning on your TV,” she told the BBC.Ms Roberts noted that BT Sport was the only British broadcaster so far to launch a regular HDR service, via its BT Sport Ultimate add-on.And although Sky’s HDR service will use technology jointly developed by the BBC and Japanese broadcaster NHK, the BBC is yet to offer HDR programming as a regular service.However, it has conducted several trials of the technology on iPlayer in recent years.",27 May 2020,technology
Facebook shareholders try to block encryption plan,"Investors at Facebook's annual stockholder meeting will vote on a proposal to postpone the firm's plans for end-to-end encryption.The firm says it wants to make the measure the default option across its messaging platforms to protect privacy.But activist shareholders say this would make it nearly impossible to detect child exploitation on Facebook.The group wants the company to delay the move until after its board of directors studies the risk further. ""As shareholders, we know that privacy is important to a social media company, but it should not come at the expense of unleashing a whole new torrent of virtually undetectable child sexual abuse on Facebook,"" said Michael Passoff, founder of Proxy Impact, a shareholder advocacy service supporting the measure.Facebook's 2020 annual shareholders' meeting will be held virtually due to Covid-19, but investors will still be able to vote on measures and hear about the management plans.Facebook claims to be a leader in fighting child exploitation on the internet. ""As we expand end-to-end encryption to secure people's private messages from hackers and criminals we remain committed to leading our industry in keeping children safe,"" it said.The measure is unlikely to pass. Most of the company's voting shares are controlled by Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and a small number of other executives.In March 2019, Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted the firm to make end-to-end encryption the base level of security for all its messaging services - including Facebook Messenger and Instagram messaging. But he did not lay out a timeline, and many engineers thought it would be several years before it happened.The initiative would mean that messages - including text and imagery - are digitally scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can make sense of them, and not Facebook itself.WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, already has this level of security. The US, UK and Australian governments have been among those pressuring Facebook to create a backdoor or other workaround that would give them access to  messages to help in criminal investigations. The company has so far refused to do this.The measure put forward by Proxy Impact would force Facebook to examine whether something could be done to mitigate ""the risk of increased sexual exploitation of children"" as a consequence.In 2019, tech companies reported close to 70 million videos and pictures of children being sexually exploited to authorities. Nearly 85% of those reports came from Facebook.According to Mr Passoff, if the firm were to go through with its encryption plans, 70% of the cases it reports would become invisible to the firm.For Facebook, this is a matter of balancing privacy and public security.Users have expressed anger in the past at Facebook's use and protection of their personal data. End-to-end encryption should prevent criminals from gaining access to private conversations and help protect personal and financial data, assuming users' devices are not compromised.It would also offer the firm a defence against being responsible for detecting and reporting criminal and terrorist activity, as it would no longer be able to read the messages involved.Some investors supporting the measure claim this could prove damaging to the company.""Numerous controversies have eroded its reputational capital and put the company at risk for future competitive threats,"" said Lisette Cooper, vice-chair of Fiduciary Trust International, which is supporting the vote.  ""The position of Facebook as the world's number one hub for online child sexual abuse material is not the marketing strategy you want to have for long-term success.""However, Mr Zuckerberg has previously addressed the issue directly.""When we were deciding whether to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this was one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,"" he said in October.But he added that he was ""optimistic"" that predators could still be identified by other means, including their patterns of activity.",27 May 2020,technology
Zipline drones deliver supplies and PPE to US hospitals,"Drone firm Zipline has been given the go-ahead to deliver medical supplies and personal protective equipment to hospitals in North Carolina.The firm will be allowed to use drones on two specified routes after the Federal Aviation Administration granted it an emergency waiver.It is the first time the FAA has allowed beyond-line-of-sight drone deliveries in the US.Experts say the pandemic could help ease some drone-flight regulations.Zipline, which has been negotiating with the FAA, wants to expand to other hospitals and eventually offer deliveries to people's homes.It has been granted a waiver for two routes involving round trips of up to 30 miles (48km).The drones will launch from a nearby fulfilment centre and drop off a box of medical products by parachute at a designated spots. The drones can carry up to almost 4lb (1.8kg) of cargo and can fly at up to 80mph, even in rain or wind.""The Covid-19 pandemic has tasked us with being even more nimble and innovative in how to solve complex challenges,"" said Angela Yochem, chief digital officer of Novant Health, which is the partner for the service.""Fast-tracking our medical drone transport capability is just one example of how we're pioneering in the health care industry, which is known for being resistant to change,"" Zipline has struggled to find a commercial foothold in the US market, but chief executive Keller Rinaudo said he hoped the North Carolina example could ""provide the rest of the country with a blueprint"" for future healthcare deliveries.The pandemic has prompted a handful of new drone deliveries. The Windracers Ultra fixed-wing drone has been delivering PPE from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight - a 10-minute journey - and in Ireland, Manna Aero is working with the health authority to deliver prescriptions and other essential supplies to a small rural town.Robotics expert Prof Noel Sharkey believes the pandemic could make drone deliveries more common.""In a global pandemic everything changes,"" he said.""Rules and laws need to be manipulated and restrictions lifted to enable the use of all possible technological advantages to save large numbers of lives. ""The problem of course is how to wind back the clock on tech once we are out of the Covid-19 crisis.""",27 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: NHS app paves the way for 'immunity passports',"Facial recognition has been added as a way of logging in to an NHS app that lets people order prescriptions, book appointments and find healthcare data.Initially, it will allow faster access to the services on the app, which is separate from the contact-tracing one.But its developers say it could also be used for Covid-19 ""immunity passports"".Such passports, where people carry documented proof they have immunity because of a past infection, are already being tested in Estonia.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has previously hinted at the possible use of a ""system of certification"" for those with antibodies for coronavirus.The NHS facial-recognition system, built by iProov and available in England for both Android devices and iOS, requires users to submit a photo of themselves from an official document such as their passport or driving license. The system scans a person's face using their phone and, following a short sequence of flashing colours, their identification will be verified and they will have access to all the services on the NHS app.More than a million people have now registered with NHS login, with a peak of more than 60,000 new IDs verified during the first week of April.Founder Andrew Bud told BBC News: ""NHS Digital has built a strong and trusted identity system in NHS login, which, in my opinion, should form the basis of the UK's immunity passport. ""Whether they do so is a decision for them.""In response, a spokesperson for NHS Digital said it ""has not been commissioned to apply this technology to any other purposes beyond providing a secure login capability via mobile devices"".Immunity passports need to link a person's identity to their coronavirus test results, so would require a robust way of allowing people to verify themselves. Those deemed clear of the virus could then prove their status via a code generated by an app. The idea has proved controversial, not least because there is no hard scientific evidence that having had the coronavirus provides people with long-lasting immunity.The World Health Organization has warned countries against implementing such passports, saying: ""There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.""But Mr Bud said: ""At-home antibody tests are coming soon and will quickly cause the creation of a whole information system, of which they will be at the heart. ""That is inevitable and is no longer subject to political choice.""There are big questions that this system will pose to society - such as how to discourage people from uploading false immunity results, how to prevent discrimination on the basis of immunity status and how to stop information leaking uncontrollably.""Estonia has begun testing one of the world's first immunity passports, which would allow citizens to show their coronavirus test results to third parties, such as employers or even restaurants.Taavet Hinrikus, founder of Transferwise, the company is developing the technology for the Estonian system, said it would ""diminish fears and stimulate societies all over the globe to move on with their lives amidst the pandemic"".But Dr Tom Fisher, a senior researcher at Privacy International, said the implementation of such measures needed to be ""necessary, proportionate and based on the epidemiological evidence"".""For the moment, immunity passports do not meet this test,"" he said.""We must be concerned about the broad societal impact of such immunity passports. ""They are essentially about limiting the rights of those who are not deemed to be immune. ""This is a route to exclusion and discrimination.""Similarly, an improperly implemented programme risks perverse effects, like people deliberately seeking to get infected to gain the benefits of a status of being immune.""Robin Tombs, the chief executive of digital identity company Yoti said it would be ""technically simple"" to extend its work with coronavirus testers at GeneMe to antibody tests but: ""The science on Covid-19 immunity is still too early to issue meaningful immunity passports.""",27 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: First Google/Apple-based contact-tracing app launched,"The team developing Switzerland's coronavirus contact-tracing app says it has become the first to have launched a product incorporating a technology provided by Apple and Google.Members of the Swiss army, hospital workers and civil servants can now install the SwissCovid app ahead of a planned wider rollout.A Latvian coalition says it is running close behind.But the US tech firms face criticism for their prescriptive approach.Automated contact tracing involves using smartphones to detect when two people are close to each other for long enough that there is a significant risk of contagion, so that one can be warned if the other is later diagnosed with having the disease.To make use of their API (application programming interface) - a software tool that gives special access to some features of their iOS and Android mobile operating systems - the two companies have forbidden participants from gathering users' location data, among other restrictions.That means that apps that pursue a rival ""centralised"" model will continue to face circumstances when iPhones fail to carry out the required Bluetooth-based ""handshakes"".""The use of digital technologies must be designed in such a way that we, as democratically elected governments, evaluate it and judge it acceptable to our citizens and in accordance with our European values,"" wrote digital affairs ministers from the German, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese governments in a joint letter published in the press.""We believe that challenging this right by imposing technical standards represents a misstep and a missed opportunity for open collaboration between governments and the private sector."" The BBC has asked Apple and Google for their response.The Swiss team, however, has welcomed the two firms' involvement.""Bluetooth was not developed for this kind of large-scale distance measurement,"" said Prof Srdjan Capkun from the ETH institute.""Making sure that we can use it in this way requires a lot of engineering skill and collaboration, including collaboration with Apple and Google.""Apple and Google said last week that 22 countries, as well as some US states, had requested access to its API.Some, like the UK, are testing it as a back-up to their own independent projects, while others are rushing to release apps based on it as soon as possible.In Switzerland's case, MPs must first debate and approve the scheme before it is offered to the general public. The government hopes this can be done by mid-June.Advocates have highlighted an opinion poll that suggests 70% of Swiss residents support the initiative.By contrast, the Latvian team - which has also incorporated the API - is able to proceed without a parliamentary vote, and hopes to offer its Apturi Covid app to the public as soon as Thursday.A spokeswoman told the BBC that Apple had already approved the software to appear on its App Store, but the developers were still waiting for permission to list it on the Google Play marketplace.""Of course we would be very happy to be the first [national launch], but the most important thing is to help our inhabitants fights the virus,"" she added.In other developments:",26 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Apprentice star's firm rebuked over Covid-19 ads,"A company led by a former Apprentice contestant has had three social media adverts banned by the Advertising Standards Authority over misleading Covid-19 claims. The ASA said Revival Shots, founded by Daniel Elahi, had suggested its Vitamin C rehydration sachets could boost immunity and help cure the disease. The firm has now removed one advert from Facebook and two from Instagram. It noted other posts had said its goods could not be used to treat the virus.The ASA's investigation was fast-tracked as part of the watchdog's focus on ads that exploit health concerns during the current Covid-19 crisis. It said one of the examples had made claims that vitamin C was being tested in the US and China as a possible cure for Covid-19. The post was accompanied by a caption that said each sachet contained 500mg of vitamin C.A spokesman for the ASA said: ""We considered the ad, therefore, implied that consuming Revival Shots could, through their vitamin C content, help to cure Covid-19.""Another advert featured a user review that claimed their headache and sore throat lessened almost immediately after consumption. Both are listed by the NHS as potential symptoms of Covid-19.""Given that the ad was posted in mid-April 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, referred to symptoms sometimes associated with Covid-19 and the reviewer's 'paranoia' about those symptoms, and included the hashtag '#staysafe' which was commonly associated with the pandemic, we considered consumers would understand that the claims in the review were intended to be understood to relate to Covid-19,"" said the watchdog.The ASA also found the company could not support claims that its product's vitamin C content could boost immunity.""Revival Shots had not provided any evidence to demonstrate that their products contained any vitamin in amounts sufficient that they could use any of those authorised health claims in advertising for their products,"" added the ruling.

This month the platform introduced a new policy on misleading information amid the coronavirus pandemic.But recent posts in which Mr Trump - who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter - promoted a conspiracy theory about the death of political aide Lori Klausutis, blaming a high-profile critic, have not received the same treatment.The notification on Mr Trump's tweet shows a blue exclamation mark and a link suggesting readers ""get the facts about mail-in ballots"".It directs users to a page on which Mr Trump's claims are described as ""unsubstantiated"", citing reporting by CNN, the Washington Post and others.The pandemic is putting pressure on US states to expand the use of postal voting because people are worried about becoming infected at polling stations.In a ""what you need to know"" section, Twitter writes that Mr Trump ""falsely claimed mail-in ballots would lead to 'a Rigged Election'."" ""Fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud,"" it continues.The company had pledged to increase the use of warning labels about false or misleading information on its site, but has been slow to take steps against the US president.Mr Trump posted the same claim about mail-in ballots on Facebook, but it is not fact-checked on that platform.Mr Trump then accused Twitter of interfering in the US presidential election scheduled for 3 November 2020, saying the company was ""completely stifling free speech, and I, as president, will not allow it to happen"".His tweet on Wednesday told social media to ""clean up your act now"" and that he would not let a ""more sophisticated version"" of what they had ""attempted to do, and failed, in 2016"" happen again. He did not elaborate.With more than 52,000 tweets currently to his name, Mr Trump is a prolific tweeter and relies on the platform to disseminate his views to millions of people.He has used Twitter to launch attacks on opponents, with targets ranging from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to his political rivals in the US.In 2017 he used anti-Muslim tweets aimed at London Mayor Sadiq Khan to serve a domestic political purpose of warning about immigration, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher reported.On Tuesday Mr Trump's presidential campaign manager Brad Parscale also criticised Twitter's decision.""Partnering with biased fake news 'fact checkers' is a smoke screen to lend Twitter's obvious political tactics false credibility. There are many reasons we pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and clear political bias is one of them,"" Mr Parscale tweeted.Analysis by BBC's technology reporter Zoe ThomasPresident Trump has used Twitter as a platform to pick fights with other politicians and celebrities. Now he may be in for a fight with the platform itself.Following the firm's decision to label his tweets as misleading, he claimed on Twitter that the company was stifling free speech and that he wouldn't allow it. But Twitter as a private company gets to set its own rules for what happens on its platform.The trouble for many was that up until Tuesday the firm didn't seem to be enforcing its rules when it came to the US president or other global leaders. This is not the first time President Trump has made claims on Twitter that some say would have had less powerful people blocked from the site. But Mr Trump's bombastic comments are part of what draws some of his followers to the site in the first place. The company doesn't want to lose them.It sees the new labelling system as a way to balance both the desire to allow Twitter users including the president to say what they like, while also giving readers protection against misleading claims. The strategy mostly worked with tweets about Covid-19.But with the US election in November, Twitter should expect a lot more posts with potentially misleading information. Meaning this is likely only the first test for its new enforcement plans.They are voting bulletins that are distributed and returned by post. In a recent opinion survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 66% of Americans said they would not be comfortable going to a polling place to cast their ballot during the coronavirus outbreak.Such concerns have increased pressure on states to expand the availability of mail-in ballots for all voters in order to minimise the risk of viral exposure from in-person voting.While every state provides some form of remote voting, the requirements to qualify vary greatly.Five states in the western US, including Washington, Oregon and Colorado, conduct their elections entirely via mail-in ballot. Others, like California, provide a postal ballot to anyone who requests it.On the other end of the spectrum, 17 states require voters to provide a valid reason why they are unable to vote in-person in order to qualify for an absentee ballot. The move comes on the heels of Twitter's decision not to remove a comment President Trump made about the death of Lori Klausutis in 2001. The president has tweeted several messages promoting a conspiracy theory that Ms Klausutis was murdered by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Her widower Timothy Klausutis asked Twitter to remove the post, saying it included ""horrifying lies"".The company told Mr Klausutis it was ""deeply sorry"" about the pain caused by the president's statements, but said the tweets did not violate their policies.",27 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Twitter will label Covid-19 fake news,"Twitter has started putting warning messages on tweets containing misleading information about Covid-19.And it confirmed US President Donald Trump, who has previously suggested injecting disinfectants could help cure coronavirus, would be subject to the new rules.But one expert fears moderators will be overwhelmed and asked how much notice people would take of the warnings.Some may even see warnings on tweets as ""a mark of pride"", he suggested.In a blog, Twitter said it wanted to ""limit the spread of potentially harmful and misleading content"" around the coronavirus.In a tweet responding to questions about the changes, Twitter's head of site integrity, Yoel Roth, said the policy would ""apply to anyone sharing misleading information that meets the requirement of our policy, including world leaders"".A link to a Twitter-curated page or external trusted source containing additional information will be added to offending tweets.And in some cases, readers will be warned the tweet conflicts with expert opinion.Twitter is targeting claims:It said the new system would also apply to tweets sent before this week.""Our teams are using and improving on internal systems to proactively monitor content related to Covid-19,"" it added.But Dr Bernie Hogan, from the Oxford Internet Institute, said: ""Cranks and trolls... often have deliberate disinformation campaigns in order to simply swamp moderators.""The problem to me is that Trump and his ilk have done such a good job of labelling disagreement as fake news that I believe his supporters are likely to tune out these warnings.""It might even be seen as a mark of pride that one's opinions are considered false by 'the establishment'.""Much like other social networks, Twitter has struggled to control the flow of misinformation on its platform since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. After tightening its policies against harmful content in March, the company says it has removed 1,100 misleading tweets and ""challenged"" more than 3.4 million accounts manipulating the conversation about Covid-19.The new labelling system seems very similar to Facebook's programme for flagging misleading content, although Twitter will not be using information from independent fact-checkers to label content. The challenge for technology giants is finding the balance between removing genuinely harmful misinformation and protecting their users' right to free speech.This is not an easy balancing act. Platforms face questions by politicians and members of the public if they do not take action against harmful misinformation and will similarly be subject to accusations of censorship if their actions are deemed to be too severe.

Sky Q kicks off HDR support starting with on-demand nature shows,"Sky has launched three new on-demand nature programmes featuring high dynamic range (HDR) for Sky Q customers.HDR offers a greater range of colours, making pictures more vivid and realistic than before.But Sky viewers will need a Sky Q 1TB or 2TB set-top box and a Sky Experience or Ultra HD subscription to see the difference. Previous reports had suggested Sky wouldn’t launch HDR until late 2020.It coincides with the launch of Sky’s new nature channel on Wednesday.The first programmes available on-demand with HDR will all be nature documentaries:Sky also confirmed that it planned to broadcast the 2021 Olympic Games live in HDR. Other programmes will offer HDR before the end of the current year, including movies.In December last year, it was reported that Sky had delayed the launch of its HDR service until “late 2020” so it was “a bit of a surprise” that it had become available today, said Becky Roberts of What Hi-Fi? magazine.“If you’ve got a compatible Sky Q box and a TV that supports HDR, it should be as simple as turning on your TV,” she told the BBC.Ms Roberts noted that BT Sport was the only British broadcaster so far to launch a regular HDR service, via its BT Sport Ultimate add-on.And although Sky’s HDR service will use technology jointly developed by the BBC and Japanese broadcaster NHK, the BBC is yet to offer HDR programming as a regular service.However, it has conducted several trials of the technology on iPlayer in recent years.",27 May 2020,technology
Facebook shareholders try to block encryption plan,"Investors at Facebook's annual stockholder meeting will vote on a proposal to postpone the firm's plans for end-to-end encryption.The firm says it wants to make the measure the default option across its messaging platforms to protect privacy.But activist shareholders say this would make it nearly impossible to detect child exploitation on Facebook.The group wants the company to delay the move until after its board of directors studies the risk further. ""As shareholders, we know that privacy is important to a social media company, but it should not come at the expense of unleashing a whole new torrent of virtually undetectable child sexual abuse on Facebook,"" said Michael Passoff, founder of Proxy Impact, a shareholder advocacy service supporting the measure.Facebook's 2020 annual shareholders' meeting will be held virtually due to Covid-19, but investors will still be able to vote on measures and hear about the management plans.Facebook claims to be a leader in fighting child exploitation on the internet. ""As we expand end-to-end encryption to secure people's private messages from hackers and criminals we remain committed to leading our industry in keeping children safe,"" it said.The measure is unlikely to pass. Most of the company's voting shares are controlled by Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and a small number of other executives.In March 2019, Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted the firm to make end-to-end encryption the base level of security for all its messaging services - including Facebook Messenger and Instagram messaging. But he did not lay out a timeline, and many engineers thought it would be several years before it happened.The initiative would mean that messages - including text and imagery - are digitally scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can make sense of them, and not Facebook itself.WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, already has this level of security. The US, UK and Australian governments have been among those pressuring Facebook to create a backdoor or other workaround that would give them access to  messages to help in criminal investigations. The company has so far refused to do this.The measure put forward by Proxy Impact would force Facebook to examine whether something could be done to mitigate ""the risk of increased sexual exploitation of children"" as a consequence.In 2019, tech companies reported close to 70 million videos and pictures of children being sexually exploited to authorities. Nearly 85% of those reports came from Facebook.According to Mr Passoff, if the firm were to go through with its encryption plans, 70% of the cases it reports would become invisible to the firm.For Facebook, this is a matter of balancing privacy and public security.Users have expressed anger in the past at Facebook's use and protection of their personal data. End-to-end encryption should prevent criminals from gaining access to private conversations and help protect personal and financial data, assuming users' devices are not compromised.It would also offer the firm a defence against being responsible for detecting and reporting criminal and terrorist activity, as it would no longer be able to read the messages involved.Some investors supporting the measure claim this could prove damaging to the company.""Numerous controversies have eroded its reputational capital and put the company at risk for future competitive threats,"" said Lisette Cooper, vice-chair of Fiduciary Trust International, which is supporting the vote.  ""The position of Facebook as the world's number one hub for online child sexual abuse material is not the marketing strategy you want to have for long-term success.""However, Mr Zuckerberg has previously addressed the issue directly.""When we were deciding whether to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this was one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,"" he said in October.But he added that he was ""optimistic"" that predators could still be identified by other means, including their patterns of activity.",27 May 2020,technology
Zipline drones deliver supplies and PPE to US hospitals,"Drone firm Zipline has been given the go-ahead to deliver medical supplies and personal protective equipment to hospitals in North Carolina.The firm will be allowed to use drones on two specified routes after the Federal Aviation Administration granted it an emergency waiver.It is the first time the FAA has allowed beyond-line-of-sight drone deliveries in the US.Experts say the pandemic could help ease some drone-flight regulations.Zipline, which has been negotiating with the FAA, wants to expand to other hospitals and eventually offer deliveries to people's homes.It has been granted a waiver for two routes involving round trips of up to 30 miles (48km).The drones will launch from a nearby fulfilment centre and drop off a box of medical products by parachute at a designated spots. The drones can carry up to almost 4lb (1.8kg) of cargo and can fly at up to 80mph, even in rain or wind.""The Covid-19 pandemic has tasked us with being even more nimble and innovative in how to solve complex challenges,"" said Angela Yochem, chief digital officer of Novant Health, which is the partner for the service.""Fast-tracking our medical drone transport capability is just one example of how we're pioneering in the health care industry, which is known for being resistant to change,"" Zipline has struggled to find a commercial foothold in the US market, but chief executive Keller Rinaudo said he hoped the North Carolina example could ""provide the rest of the country with a blueprint"" for future healthcare deliveries.The pandemic has prompted a handful of new drone deliveries.

Coronavirus: NHS app paves the way for 'immunity passports',"Facial recognition has been added as a way of logging in to an NHS app that lets people order prescriptions, book appointments and find healthcare data.Initially, it will allow faster access to the services on the app, which is separate from the contact-tracing one.But its developers say it could also be used for Covid-19 ""immunity passports"".Such passports, where people carry documented proof they have immunity because of a past infection, are already being tested in Estonia.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has previously hinted at the possible use of a ""system of certification"" for those with antibodies for coronavirus.The NHS facial-recognition system, built by iProov and available in England for both Android devices and iOS, requires users to submit a photo of themselves from an official document such as their passport or driving license. The system scans a person's face using their phone and, following a short sequence of flashing colours, their identification will be verified and they will have access to all the services on the NHS app.More than a million people have now registered with NHS login, with a peak of more than 60,000 new IDs verified during the first week of April.Founder Andrew Bud told BBC News: ""NHS Digital has built a strong and trusted identity system in NHS login, which, in my opinion, should form the basis of the UK's immunity passport. ""Whether they do so is a decision for them.""In response, a spokesperson for NHS Digital said it ""has not been commissioned to apply this technology to any other purposes beyond providing a secure login capability via mobile devices"".Immunity passports need to link a person's identity to their coronavirus test results, so would require a robust way of allowing people to verify themselves. Those deemed clear of the virus could then prove their status via a code generated by an app. The idea has proved controversial, not least because there is no hard scientific evidence that having had the coronavirus provides people with long-lasting immunity.The World Health Organization has warned countries against implementing such passports, saying: ""There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.""But Mr Bud said: ""At-home antibody tests are coming soon and will quickly cause the creation of a whole information system, of which they will be at the heart. ""That is inevitable and is no longer subject to political choice.""There are big questions that this system will pose to society - such as how to discourage people from uploading false immunity results, how to prevent discrimination on the basis of immunity status and how to stop information leaking uncontrollably.""Estonia has begun testing one of the world's first immunity passports, which would allow citizens to show their coronavirus test results to third parties, such as employers or even restaurants.Taavet Hinrikus, founder of Transferwise, the company is developing the technology for the Estonian system, said it would ""diminish fears and stimulate societies all over the globe to move on with their lives amidst the pandemic"".But Dr Tom Fisher, a senior researcher at Privacy International, said the implementation of such measures needed to be ""necessary, proportionate and based on the epidemiological evidence"".""For the moment, immunity passports do not meet this test,"" he said.""We must be concerned about the broad societal impact of such immunity passports. ""They are essentially about limiting the rights of those who are not deemed to be immune. ""This is a route to exclusion and discrimination.""Similarly, an improperly implemented programme risks perverse effects, like people deliberately seeking to get infected to gain the benefits of a status of being immune.""Robin Tombs, the chief executive of digital identity company Yoti said it would be ""technically simple"" to extend its work with coronavirus testers at GeneMe to antibody tests but: ""The science on Covid-19 immunity is still too early to issue meaningful immunity passports.""",27 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: First Google/Apple-based contact-tracing app launched,"The team developing Switzerland's coronavirus contact-tracing app says it has become the first to have launched a product incorporating a technology provided by Apple and Google.Members of the Swiss army, hospital workers and civil servants can now install the SwissCovid app ahead of a planned wider rollout.A Latvian coalition says it is running close behind.But the US tech firms face criticism for their prescriptive approach.Automated contact tracing involves using smartphones to detect when two people are close to each other for long enough that there is a significant risk of contagion, so that one can be warned if the other is later diagnosed with having the disease.To make use of their API (application programming interface) - a software tool that gives special access to some features of their iOS and Android mobile operating systems - the two companies have forbidden participants from gathering users' location data, among other restrictions.That means that apps that pursue a rival ""centralised"" model will continue to face circumstances when iPhones fail to carry out the required Bluetooth-based ""handshakes"".""The use of digital technologies must be designed in such a way that we, as democratically elected governments, evaluate it and judge it acceptable to our citizens and in accordance with our European values,"" wrote digital affairs ministers from the German, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese governments in a joint letter published in the press.""We believe that challenging this right by imposing technical standards represents a misstep and a missed opportunity for open collaboration between governments and the private sector."" The BBC has asked Apple and Google for their response.The Swiss team, however, has welcomed the two firms' involvement.""Bluetooth was not developed for this kind of large-scale distance measurement,"" said Prof Srdjan Capkun from the ETH institute.""Making sure that we can use it in this way requires a lot of engineering skill and collaboration, including collaboration with Apple and Google.""Apple and Google said last week that 22 countries, as well as some US states, had requested access to its API.Some, like the UK, are testing it as a back-up to their own independent projects, while others are rushing to release apps based on it as soon as possible.In Switzerland's case, MPs must first debate and approve the scheme before it is offered to the general public. The government hopes this can be done by mid-June.Advocates have highlighted an opinion poll that suggests 70% of Swiss residents support the initiative.By contrast, the Latvian team - which has also incorporated the API - is able to proceed without a parliamentary vote, and hopes to offer its Apturi Covid app to the public as soon as Thursday.A spokeswoman told the BBC that Apple had already approved the software to appear on its App Store, but the developers were still waiting for permission to list it on the Google Play marketplace.""Of course we would be very happy to be the first [national launch], but the most important thing is to help our inhabitants fights the virus,"" she added.In other developments:",26 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Apprentice star's firm rebuked over Covid-19 ads,"A company led by a former Apprentice contestant has had three social media adverts banned by the Advertising Standards Authority over misleading Covid-19 claims. The ASA said Revival Shots, founded by Daniel Elahi, had suggested its Vitamin C rehydration sachets could boost immunity and help cure the disease. The firm has now removed one advert from Facebook and two from Instagram. It noted other posts had said its goods could not be used to treat the virus.The ASA's investigation was fast-tracked as part of the watchdog's focus on ads that exploit health concerns during the current Covid-19 crisis. It said one of the examples had made claims that vitamin C was being tested in the US and China as a possible cure for Covid-19. The post was accompanied by a caption that said each sachet contained 500mg of vitamin C.A spokesman for the ASA said: ""We considered the ad, therefore, implied that consuming Revival Shots could, through their vitamin C content, help to cure Covid-19.""Another advert featured a user review that claimed their headache and sore throat lessened almost immediately after consumption. Both are listed by the NHS as potential symptoms of Covid-19.""Given that the ad was posted in mid-April 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, referred to symptoms sometimes associated with Covid-19 and the reviewer's 'paranoia' about those symptoms, and included the hashtag '#staysafe' which was commonly associated with the pandemic, we considered consumers would understand that the claims in the review were intended to be understood to relate to Covid-19,"" said the watchdog.The ASA also found the company could not support claims that its product's vitamin C content could boost immunity.""Revival Shots had not provided any evidence to demonstrate that their products contained any vitamin in amounts sufficient that they could use any of those authorised health claims in advertising for their products,"" added the ruling. ""The ads must not appear again in the form complained about.""Mr Elahi runs Revival and is one of its two directors.He acknowledged the ASA's complaint but noted that the firm's site also featured other posts ""stating clearly that our products cannot be used in the treatment of Covid-19"".",27 May 2020,technology

Those deemed clear of the virus could then prove their status via a code generated by an app. The idea has proved controversial, not least because there is no hard scientific evidence that having had the coronavirus provides people with long-lasting immunity.The World Health Organization has warned countries against implementing such passports, saying: ""There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.""But Mr Bud said: ""At-home antibody tests are coming soon and will quickly cause the creation of a whole information system, of which they will be at the heart. ""That is inevitable and is no longer subject to political choice.""There are big questions that this system will pose to society - such as how to discourage people from uploading false immunity results, how to prevent discrimination on the basis of immunity status and how to stop information leaking uncontrollably.""Estonia has begun testing one of the world's first immunity passports, which would allow citizens to show their coronavirus test results to third parties, such as employers or even restaurants.Taavet Hinrikus, founder of Transferwise, the company is developing the technology for the Estonian system, said it would ""diminish fears and stimulate societies all over the globe to move on with their lives amidst the pandemic"".But Dr Tom Fisher, a senior researcher at Privacy International, said the implementation of such measures needed to be ""necessary, proportionate and based on the epidemiological evidence"".""For the moment, immunity passports do not meet this test,"" he said.""We must be concerned about the broad societal impact of such immunity passports. ""They are essentially about limiting the rights of those who are not deemed to be immune. ""This is a route to exclusion and discrimination.""Similarly, an improperly implemented programme risks perverse effects, like people deliberately seeking to get infected to gain the benefits of a status of being immune.""Robin Tombs, the chief executive of digital identity company Yoti said it would be ""technically simple"" to extend its work with coronavirus testers at GeneMe to antibody tests but: ""The science on Covid-19 immunity is still too early to issue meaningful immunity passports.""",27 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: First Google/Apple-based contact-tracing app launched,"The team developing Switzerland's coronavirus contact-tracing app says it has become the first to have launched a product incorporating a technology provided by Apple and Google.Members of the Swiss army, hospital workers and civil servants can now install the SwissCovid app ahead of a planned wider rollout.A Latvian coalition says it is running close behind.But the US tech firms face criticism for their prescriptive approach.Automated contact tracing involves using smartphones to detect when two people are close to each other for long enough that there is a significant risk of contagion, so that one can be warned if the other is later diagnosed with having the disease.To make use of their API (application programming interface) - a software tool that gives special access to some features of their iOS and Android mobile operating systems - the two companies have forbidden participants from gathering users' location data, among other restrictions.That means that apps that pursue a rival ""centralised"" model will continue to face circumstances when iPhones fail to carry out the required Bluetooth-based ""handshakes"".""The use of digital technologies must be designed in such a way that we, as democratically elected governments, evaluate it and judge it acceptable to our citizens and in accordance with our European values,"" wrote digital affairs ministers from the German, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese governments in a joint letter published in the press.""We believe that challenging this right by imposing technical standards represents a misstep and a missed opportunity for open collaboration between governments and the private sector."" The BBC has asked Apple and Google for their response.The Swiss team, however, has welcomed the two firms' involvement.""Bluetooth was not developed for this kind of large-scale distance measurement,"" said Prof Srdjan Capkun from the ETH institute.""Making sure that we can use it in this way requires a lot of engineering skill and collaboration, including collaboration with Apple and Google.""Apple and Google said last week that 22 countries, as well as some US states, had requested access to its API.Some, like the UK, are testing it as a back-up to their own independent projects, while others are rushing to release apps based on it as soon as possible.In Switzerland's case, MPs must first debate and approve the scheme before it is offered to the general public. The government hopes this can be done by mid-June.Advocates have highlighted an opinion poll that suggests 70% of Swiss residents support the initiative.By contrast, the Latvian team - which has also incorporated the API - is able to proceed without a parliamentary vote, and hopes to offer its Apturi Covid app to the public as soon as Thursday.A spokeswoman told the BBC that Apple had already approved the software to appear on its App Store, but the developers were still waiting for permission to list it on the Google Play marketplace.""Of course we would be very happy to be the first [national launch], but the most important thing is to help our inhabitants fights the virus,"" she added.In other developments:",26 May 2020,technology

Google deletes millions of negative TikTok reviews,"Google has deleted millions of negative TikTok reviews from its Play store after the app's rating fell from 4.5 to 1.2 stars overnight. The video-sharing platform was inundated with one-star reviews after an Indian creator posted a spoof video of an acid attack. Faizal Siddiqui has apologised, and TikTok has deleted copies of his clip.But Google intervened after it determined that critics had set up fake accounts to amplify their protests.Even so, the move has had limited effect, and TikTok's rating remains below two stars on the official Android marketplace.The video in question had appeared to show Mr Siddiqui threatening a woman who had decided to leave him. In the clip, he threw liquid at the woman's face. It was water, but the next scene showed the woman's face covered in make-up that resembled the scars and bruising that acid might cause.“As per the policy, we do not allow content that risks the safety of others, promotes physical harm, or glorifies violence against women,"" a spokesman for TikTok said.""The behaviour in question violates our guidelines and we have taken down content, suspended the account, and are working with law enforcement agencies as appropriate.”Mr Siddiqui later said that: ""As a social media influencer, I realise my responsibility and apologise to anyone who was offended by the video.""After TikTok became embroiled in the backlash, Google removed more than 5 million of its recent one-star reviews but left many others active.A spokesman for Google said it had taken ""corrective action"".""When we learn of incidents of spam abuse, we review and take corrective action to remove inappropriate ratings and comments,"" he added.The event coincided with TikTok's monthly revenue from in-app charges topping those of any other non-gaming app in April, including YouTube and Netflix, according to the analytics firm Sensor Tower. The  figure includes sales via the Chinese version of the product, known as Douyin, Bloomberg reported.Users can purchase virtual currency to spend on supporting their favourite creators on the app. TikTok's month-on-month in-app purchases revenues increased tenfold to $78m (£63.8m), with 86.6% coming from China, followed by 8.2% in the US.",26 May 2020,technology
Huawei: What would happen if the UK ditched the Chinese firm?,"Huawei's future in the UK is in doubt - again.The consequences could affect how quickly improved internet access is rolled out and how much it will cost. This a time when the country's economy is already in a precarious state because of the coronavirus pandemic.The catalyst for a potential rethink is the US's move to restrict the firm's ability to buy chips, which was justified on ""national security grounds"".On Sunday, the UK's National Security Centre (NCSC) confirmed it was examining what impact this would have on the UK networks that use Huawei's tech.That sounds quite vague. But it potentially paves the way for a government U-turn.In January, the prime minister gave the green light to continued use of the firm's tech in mobile and broadband networks, but said its its market share must be reduced.Now he might appreciate the chance for change of mind.It would help Boris Johnson prevent backbenchers who favour a ban from derailing his forthcoming Telecoms Infrastructure Bill. Moreover, it offers him a way to defuse tensions with the White House, which has said continued use of Huawei will have a ""dramatic impact on our ability to share [security] information"".Mr Johnson and President Trump may meet next month at a mooted G7 summit. Blocking Huawei could help secure a post-Brexit trade deal, even if it made relations with China trickier.But the company warns there would be consequences.""More suppliers means greater competition, innovation and network reliability, and crucially ensures consumers have access to the best possible technology,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief, told the BBC.""Removing Huawei would seriously delay 5G, costing the British economy up to £7bn,"" he added, citing a study published last year by Mobile UK, a trade group that represents UK network operators.Part of the reason mobile providers are concerned is that the current version of 5G relies on new equipment being plugged into existing 4G kit from the same vendor.""A lot of the 4G expansion was software-upgradeable to do 5G when an extra mast antenna was fitted,"" explained Andrew Ferguson, editor-in-chief of the news site ThinkBroadband.So, he added, even if a Huawei ban was limited to the newer technology, networks would still have to rip out and replace some of their older infrastructure as well.""It's not only a very expensive process for the operators, but it's going to be a time-consuming one as well because they need to get access to all those sites to make the changes,"" added Matthew Howett from Assembly, the consultancy that wrote Mobile UK's report.""And Huawei has been very innovative at coming up with the smallest and lightest 5G equipment, meaning the operators can sometimes just use a cherry picker to hook it onto existing mast infrastructure. Some of the others' is heavier and bulkier, which can require more in terms of getting planning consent and road closures.""Huawei's major 5G rivals are Nokia and Ericsson - two European firms.The networks claim that having three providers to choose from helps them negotiate lower prices. In many cases, they want a mix of two suppliers so that if technical problems arise with one they can fall back on the other to provide a reduced service. That doesn't always involve Huawei - O2 for instance picked Nokia and Ericsson to be its primary 5G vendors despite having trialled the Chinese firm's kit.A study commissioned by Huawei last year claimed locking it out would increase a country's 5G investment costs by between 8% and 29% due to reduced competition.And if mobile providers have to spend more, consumers can expect their bills to rise too.But one MP opposed to Huawei's rollout says there are more important considerations.""There's a free and fair competition element here, there's a security element, there's a data-privacy element, and there's a sort of geopolitics of Chinese influence as well - the influence of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Bob Seely, a member of the foreign affairs committee, told the BBC.""There shouldn't on principle be high-risk vendors in the communications network.""Huawei denies it uses state subsidies to undercut its rivals, adding that it would never spy on China's behalf or otherwise deliberately compromise its clients.Huawei is also a big player in fixed-line broadband.It currently accounts for about 44% of the equipment used in providing super-fast full-fibre connections directly to homes, office and other buildings, according to UK regulator Ofcom.BT's Openreach division aims to bring that in line with a 35% government target by using more kit from Nokia and the US firm Adtran.But this sidesteps the fact that more properties rely on an alternative set-up in which fibre only reaches roadside cabinets, and the last leg is supplied by a copper-based connection. The reason this is relevant is that tens of thousands of the cabinets involved are Huawei's.""They connect directly to the core of the network,"" commented Mr Ferguson.""But replacing those is a complete non-starter unless someone's going to throw many billions of pounds at it and also all the people to do the work."" While Huawei's opponents would prefer it to be gone altogether, they acknowledge this is impractical in the short term.But Mr Seely suggested that cabinets and other such products should be swapped out for alternatives when they are ""up for replacement"".One thing practically everyone agrees on is that the matter needs to be settled once and for at a time when so much else about the economy is uncertain.""These procurement decisions can take 18 months to two years to finalise and it takes time to ramp up supply to meet the demand,"" said Mr Howett.""So this isn't just a question of overnight deciding not to use Huawei - it would take many years to do it properly.""",26 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Hairdressers offer virtual appointments in lockdown,"Hairdressers have been offering virtual appointments to help people style their hair at home.Stylists are using apps including FaceTime, Zoom, and YouTube to provide customers live one-to-one advice and tutorials.While salons have already reopened in France and Germany, hairdressers in the UK expect to remain closed until July.An industry report estimated the hair and beauty sector contributed £6.6bn to the country's economy last year.Paul Phillips owns Chopp Hair salon in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, which shut in March when the coronavirus lockdown began.He provides a service called Chopp Drops, in which he delivers hair products to customers’ doorsteps and then demonstrates via video call how to apply the treatment.“Most hairdressers say you should never colour your hair at home, and in normal times I’d agree,” he says. “But lots of clients’ mental health has been affected by the current situation, so sorting out grey roots and split ends makes them feel better.”Paul says he serves up to 26 clients a day, but adds that he is cautious to only offer advice that is achievable at home.“It’s too technical to dye blonde hair, so those clients sadly have to sit tight and wait for the lockdown to be over,” he explains. “You don’t want somebody to mess up and then have to live with it for another seven weeks.”Most of the hairdressers the BBC spoke to offered bespoke hair kits and virtual appointments priced between £30 and £150.Ebuni Ajiduah is a hair loss-specialist. She has also moved her appointments online, offering clients home treatments, and when required referring them to dermatologists for further advice. “People now have the time to focus on things they may have neglected,” she says, adding that she’s seen an increased demand for her services.Ebuni has also launched a Virtual Wash Day every Sunday, when she invites people to join her on Zoom to wash, treat, and style hair together.“We talk about the products we use and how we twist our hair,” she says. “It’s really nice, you get some people in shower caps and others trying to keep their kids still.“It gives people a sense of normalcy when the world is on fire - you can still have a routine and focus time on yourself.”Some hairdressers advise against cutting your own hair but are still offering other tips online.“I've trimmed mine at the front but even I wouldn't attempt [to cut] mine at the back,” Michael Van Clarke says in a video on Instagram. Instead, he proceeds to show the audience how to style short hair that has grown out over a few weeks.Since closing its doors, the team from his salon has been posting videos on social media and booking virtual colour consultations, serving more than 3,000 customers online.“We have new clients which have never even been to our salon, the demand is huge,” Mr Van Clarke says. “It’s a lot easier to do the video consultations if we’ve seen them in person before, but we are still able to give advice to new customers.”Senior technicians carry out a hair assessment over an initial video call, advise on treatments and products, send them out and then offer a follow-up consultation to observe and guide the client.“Some people like their hands held for reassurance, so our technicians can show them how to hold the brush and how long to leave colour on for,” Mr Van Clarke adds.Gina Conway, who runs three salons in London, thinks this could become the ""new normal"".“Even when lockdown is over, it’s going to be chaos,” she explains. “Some people might not be able to afford to go to the salon, they might be working from home or looking after children still, so I hope we can relieve that stress through technology.”Gina says she’s now pivoting to focus on the internet.“At first I was hesitant as I wanted to keep my business as professional as possible, but this is our way of giving proper advice and helping people to feel good about themselves.”",25 May 2020,technology
How Coronavirus lockdown made a 'Zoom boom' generation,"I first realised just how quickly attitudes towards technology were changing when my mum told me, two days after lockdown began, that she had downloaded Skype.She's not exactly an early adopter - in fact, she has resolutely refused to video call anybody, ever, until now.Lockdown has removed the luxury of choice for many of us. If you want to see your relatives, it has to be on screen.As we get over the social awkwardness of the ""Zoom boom"" - when to mute that mic, when to stop talking - we're realising that, for the most part, video chat works. Whether it's family reunions, pub quizzes, office meetings or even pet appointments with the vet, we can get together quickly without being in the same room - and there's a good chance that is going to stick.Twitter has already told its staff they don't ever need to go back into the office again, and Cambridge University says its lectures will remain purely online until the summer of 2021. This week Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that up to 50% of the workforce could be working from home in the next 5-10 years. The tech giant's head of Virtual Reality, Andrew Bosworth, shared a fascinating video of what a mixed reality workspace - a combination of the real world and digital images - might look like.Broadly speaking the internet infrastructure has coped pretty well with everyone piling onto it - at least for those with access to more robust services.Some experts have long called for the net to be recognised as a public utility, alongside electricity, water and gas - as well as the requisite regulation that comes with it - and perhaps it has finally earned its spurs. John Graham-Cumming, from internet security firm Cloudflare, said the company is now seeing three daily peaks for internet traffic around the world - first thing in the morning, lunchtime and early evening - and they are bigger than ever.""If you think about the internet as a utility, can you think of another utility that could sustain 50% growth [in traffic]?"" he said.""The net has been a reliable sidekick through all this."" And the tech firms have certainly spotted their opportunity. Microsoft's Satya Nadella says digital transformation has advanced two years in two months, as we seek to be entertained, to be connected and to keep track of what is happening during the pandemic.We can already see investment and goodwill getting behind tech alternatives in the hunt for new ways of doing things: could this be the moment drone deliveries finally take off (pardon the pun), e-scooters get an easier ride, and virtual gyms put our post-lockdown bodies through their paces, via a headset, in the comfort of our own homes?History will eventually reveal whether lockdown was the dawn of a new era or merely a blip before things returned to the way they were.For tech to truly prove itself as a game-changer, it has to become part of the furniture: consistent, reliable and, therefore, totally unremarkable. And as anyone who has experienced an unexpected outage at a frustrating moment in the past few weeks will tell you, we're not quite there yet.",25 May 2020,technology
Zipline drones deliver supplies and PPE to US hospitals,"Drone firm Zipline has been given the go-ahead to deliver medical supplies and personal protective equipment to hospitals in North Carolina.The firm will be allowed to use drones on two specified routes after the Federal Aviation Administration granted it an emergency waiver.It is the first time the FAA has allowed beyond-line-of-sight drone deliveries in the US.Experts say the pandemic could help ease some drone-flight regulations.Zipline, which has been negotiating with the FAA, wants to expand to other hospitals and eventually offer deliveries to people's homes.It has been granted a waiver for two routes involving round trips of up to 30 miles (48km).The drones will launch from a nearby fulfilment centre and drop off a box of medical products by parachute at a designated spots. The drones can carry up to almost 4lb (1.8kg) of cargo and can fly at up to 80mph, even in rain or wind.""The Covid-19 pandemic has tasked us with being even more nimble and innovative in how to solve complex challenges,"" said Angela Yochem, chief digital officer of Novant Health, which is the partner for the service.""Fast-tracking our medical drone transport capability is just one example of how we're pioneering in the health care industry, which is known for being resistant to change,"" Zipline has struggled to find a commercial foothold in the US market, but chief executive Keller Rinaudo said he hoped the North Carolina example could ""provide the rest of the country with a blueprint"" for future healthcare deliveries.The pandemic has prompted a handful of new drone deliveries. The Windracers Ultra fixed-wing drone has been delivering PPE from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight - a 10-minute journey - and in Ireland, Manna Aero is working with the health authority to deliver prescriptions and other essential supplies to a small rural town.Robotics expert Prof Noel Sharkey believes the pandemic could make drone deliveries more common.""In a global pandemic everything changes,"" he said.""Rules and laws need to be manipulated and restrictions lifted to enable the use of all possible technological advantages to save large numbers of lives. ""The problem of course is how to wind back the clock on tech once we are out of the Covid-19 crisis.""",27 May 2020,technology
Twitter tags Trump tweet with fact-checking warning,"A post by US President Donald Trump has been given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time.Mr Trump tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""Twitter put a warning label in the post and linked to a page that described the claims as ""unsubstantiated"".Mr Trump on Wednesday threatened to ""strongly regulate"" or even ""close down"" social media platforms.He tweeted that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"" and that he would not allow this to happen.In an earlier tweet, he said that Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".For years, Twitter has faced criticism for not acting on the president's controversial tweets, which include personal attacks on political rivals and debunked conspiracy theories. This month the platform introduced a new policy on misleading information amid the coronavirus pandemic.But recent posts in which Mr Trump - who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter - promoted a conspiracy theory about the death of political aide Lori Klausutis, blaming a high-profile critic, have not received the same treatment.The notification on Mr Trump's tweet shows a blue exclamation mark and a link suggesting readers ""get the facts about mail-in ballots"".It directs users to a page on which Mr Trump's claims are described as ""unsubstantiated"", citing reporting by CNN, the Washington Post and others.The pandemic is putting pressure on US states to expand the use of postal voting because people are worried about becoming infected at polling stations.In a ""what you need to know"" section, Twitter writes that Mr Trump ""falsely claimed mail-in ballots would lead to 'a Rigged Election'."" ""Fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud,"" it continues.The company had pledged to increase the use of warning labels about false or misleading information on its site, but has been slow to take steps against the US president.Mr Trump posted the same claim about mail-in ballots on Facebook, but it is not fact-checked on that platform.Mr Trump then accused Twitter of interfering in the US presidential election scheduled for 3 November 2020, saying the company was ""completely stifling free speech, and I, as president, will not allow it to happen"".His tweet on Wednesday told social media to ""clean up your act now"" and that he would not let a ""more sophisticated version"" of what they had ""attempted to do, and failed, in 2016"" happen again. He did not elaborate.With more than 52,000 tweets currently to his name, Mr Trump is a prolific tweeter and relies on the platform to disseminate his views to millions of people.He has used Twitter to launch attacks on opponents, with targets ranging from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to his political rivals in the US.In 2017 he used anti-Muslim tweets aimed at London Mayor Sadiq Khan to serve a domestic political purpose of warning about immigration, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher reported.On Tuesday Mr Trump's presidential campaign manager Brad Parscale also criticised Twitter's decision.""Partnering with biased fake news 'fact checkers' is a smoke screen to lend Twitter's obvious political tactics false credibility. There are many reasons we pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and clear political bias is one of them,"" Mr Parscale tweeted.Analysis by BBC's technology reporter Zoe ThomasPresident Trump has used Twitter as a platform to pick fights with other politicians and celebrities. Now he may be in for a fight with the platform itself.Following the firm's decision to label his tweets as misleading, he claimed on Twitter that the company was stifling free speech and that he wouldn't allow it. But Twitter as a private company gets to set its own rules for what happens on its platform.The trouble for many was that up until Tuesday the firm didn't seem to be enforcing its rules when it came to the US president or other global leaders. This is not the first time President Trump has made claims on Twitter that some say would have had less powerful people blocked from the site. But Mr Trump's bombastic comments are part of what draws some of his followers to the site in the first place. The company doesn't want to lose them.It sees the new labelling system as a way to balance both the desire to allow Twitter users including the president to say what they like, while also giving readers protection against misleading claims. The strategy mostly worked with tweets about Covid-19.But with the US election in November, Twitter should expect a lot more posts with potentially misleading information. Meaning this is likely only the first test for its new enforcement plans.They are voting bulletins that are distributed and returned by post. In a recent opinion survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 66% of Americans said they would not be comfortable going to a polling place to cast their ballot during the coronavirus outbreak.Such concerns have increased pressure on states to expand the availability of mail-in ballots for all voters in order to minimise the risk of viral exposure from in-person voting.While every state provides some form of remote voting, the requirements to qualify vary greatly.Five states in the western US, including Washington, Oregon and Colorado, conduct their elections entirely via mail-in ballot. Others, like California, provide a postal ballot to anyone who requests it.On the other end of the spectrum, 17 states require voters to provide a valid reason why they are unable to vote in-person in order to qualify for an absentee ballot. The move comes on the heels of Twitter's decision not to remove a comment President Trump made about the death of Lori Klausutis in 2001. The president has tweeted several messages promoting a conspiracy theory that Ms Klausutis was murdered by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Her widower Timothy Klausutis asked Twitter to remove the post, saying it included ""horrifying lies"".The company told Mr Klausutis it was ""deeply sorry"" about the pain caused by the president's statements, but said the tweets did not violate their policies.",27 May 2020,technology
Sky Q kicks off HDR support starting with on-demand nature shows,"Sky has launched three new on-demand nature programmes featuring high dynamic range (HDR) for Sky Q customers.HDR offers a greater range of colours, making pictures more vivid and realistic than before.But Sky viewers will need a Sky Q 1TB or 2TB set-top box and a Sky Experience or Ultra HD subscription to see the difference. Previous reports had suggested Sky wouldn’t launch HDR until late 2020.It coincides with the launch of Sky’s new nature channel on Wednesday.The first programmes available on-demand with HDR will all be nature documentaries:Sky also confirmed that it planned to broadcast the 2021 Olympic Games live in HDR. Other programmes will offer HDR before the end of the current year, including movies.In December last year, it was reported that Sky had delayed the launch of its HDR service until “late 2020” so it was “a bit of a surprise” that it had become available today, said Becky Roberts of What Hi-Fi? magazine.“If you’ve got a compatible Sky Q box and a TV that supports HDR, it should be as simple as turning on your TV,” she told the BBC.Ms Roberts noted that BT Sport was the only British broadcaster so far to launch a regular HDR service, via its BT Sport Ultimate add-on.And although Sky’s HDR service will use technology jointly developed by the BBC and Japanese broadcaster NHK, the BBC is yet to offer HDR programming as a regular service.However, it has conducted several trials of the technology on iPlayer in recent years.",27 May 2020,technology
