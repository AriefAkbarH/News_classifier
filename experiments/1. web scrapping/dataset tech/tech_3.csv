Glastonbury 5G report 'hijacked by conspiracy theorists',"Last month, the town council of Glastonbury in Somerset published a report calling for a government inquiry into the safety of 5G.It promised to oppose the rollout of the next-generation mobile networks in the town. Now, three members of the group that produced the report have told the BBC they resigned because it was taken over by anti-5G activists and ""spiritual healers"".They fear it could lend credibility to conspiracy theories, such as 5G being linked to the spread of coronavirus.""The whole thing was completely biased from the beginning,"" says Mark Swann, one of those who resigned. ""Genuine scientific expertise has been scorned in favour of conspiracy and hearsay,"" wrote David Swain in his letter of resignation. 5G is the next generation of mobile phone technology. It promises faster downloads and increased capacity.The radio waves involved in 5G  - and the previous generation networks - sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not energetic enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum, which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays.Get the facts: BBC Reality CheckThe report, published after a six-month inquiry, said the council would oppose the rollout of 5G, while accepting it had no power to halt it.Glastonbury's 5G Advisory Committee was made up of nine councillors, and nine local residents who responded to adverts calling for people with relevant experience to help decide whether 5G was safe.Among the volunteers were:All four ended up resigning before the report was completed.""I joined the working group in good faith, expecting to take part in a sensible discussion about 5G,"" says Mr Swann. ""Sadly the whole thing turned out to be a clueless pantomime driven by conspiracy theorists and sceptics."" Mr Cooper reached the same conclusion: ""I worked out there were only four of us who were neutral. And the others were all absolutely against 5G, either strongly or weakly.""Most of the evidence the committee heard was from witnesses who had stated their support for a moratorium on the rollout of 5G. They included retired American professor Martin Pall, who in 2019 claimed that wireless networks would make all human beings sterile if they were not switched off within two years. Another witness was Dr Andrew Tresidder, a former GP whose website offers flower remedies and emotional healing. His presentation focused on people claiming to suffer from ""electromagnetic stress"", which he said was often not taken seriously by mainstream doctors.Committee member Roy Procter, a spiritual healer who claims dowsing can heal ""sick houses"", also gave a presentation. In the report, he speculates about a link between the coronavirus and 5G, and recommends that the council eliminate all wi-fi connections.The committee's chairman, Councillor Jon Cousins, told the BBC he strongly disagrees with the suggestion that the meetings were biased towards pseudo-science. ""Equal weight was given to all contributions,"" he says, adding that councillors ""were able to take into account the prejudice, predetermination and bias displayed on all sides of the argument"".In the report, Mr Cousins said Glastonbury had punched above its weight, and other councils had been in touch about its recommendations.But both Mr Swann and Mr Cooper were particularly concerned about the role of an external member of the committee. Christopher Baker was instrumental in choosing witnesses to appear before the committee. He also gave his own presentation in which he attacked the credibility of ICNIRP, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, the body which sets the safety standards for mobile network emissions.Mr Baker has campaigned against 5G across the south-west. Before the committee was formed, he had been lobbying Glastonbury councillors to ban the technology. In a Facebook post in May 2019, he outlined his campaigning activities and bemoaned the lack of support from residents.""The only thing that is missing is the support from the community! I can't do this for you on my own, this is about you and for you,"" he said.But in a YouTube video posted in July, he tells another anti-5G activist how he helped convince Glastonbury Town Council to get the investigation underway. He encouraged others to organise local petitions.He has also appeared in videos alongside Mark Steele, another anti-5G conspiracy theorist who claims the coronavirus is a hoax, and has posted videos of himself harassing telecoms engineers. Mr Cooper says the committee was supposed to be made up of people who lived in the area or had a business there. He complained that Christopher Baker did not meet those requirements because he lived in Hampshire, which does not even border Somerset.He resigned after the complaint was ignored, describing Mr Baker as a ""semi-professional anti-5G activist"". He highlighted a video in which Mr Baker admitted some of his fuel costs were paid by a benefactor.Mr Baker told the BBC it was true that he lived in Hampshire, but said he had long-term connections to Glastonbury, and in any case other members of the committee were from outside the town. He admitted that he did receive some funding from a benefactor he refused to name. ""I don't have a lot of money, and if I travel half-way up the country to give a presentation, the least I expect is someone to contribute something towards my fuel bill.""He said those who resigned from the committee were dismissive of the evidence, rude to witnesses such as Prof Pall, and a disruptive force at the meetings. Committee chair Jon Cousins agreed: ""Some of the behaviours displayed by non-councillor members when they could not debate by 'reason' broke Glastonbury Town Council's code of conduct.""This is strongly denied by Mark Swann and his colleagues.The committee did hear evidence from Mobile UK, the mobile operators' trade body. Its presentation was criticised by one member for being ""glossy"", and others alleged there was no attempt to answer questions. Gareth Elliott of Mobile UK denied that: ""We answered everything that was asked of us."" However, he said it was a cordial meeting and his organisation respected the views of the committee.He recounts an incident where one committee member arrived late to a meeting. She said that although she was hyper-sensitive to electromagnetic emissions, she deemed the meeting room to be safe. ""It was then noted that a wi-fi router was operating and was in the room,"" he says.Those who resigned from the committee say they are concerned about the reputation of Glastonbury. Last month, Piers Corbyn - the brother of the former Labour leader - led an anti-lockdown protest in the town, where slogans against 5G were shouted. Mr Swann says the atmosphere in the town has been tense lately and he is worried about the impact of the 5G report.""This fallacious report severely damages Glastonbury's credibility,"" he says. ""It undermines years of good work by well-meaning councillors and leaves a dark shadow over the town's  reputation.""But Councillor Jon Cousins rejects the idea that the report may have served to encourage the conspiracy theorists. ""Glastonbury Town Council's position and resolutions around 5G do not - and have never - suggested a link between 5G and Covid-19 or indeed that coronavirus is a hoax."" He says the council worked closely with Avon and Somerset Police to deal with last month's demonstration and breaches of social distancing legislation.",16 May 2020,technology
Facebook buys GIF-maker Giphy to add to Instagram team,"Facebook has purchased the GIF-maker Giphy and plans to make it part of the Instagram team.A report from Axios values the deal at $400m (£330m), but Facebook would not confirm the final price.In a blog post, Instagram's VP of Products Vishal Shah said third party firms would still have access to Giphy's library of GIFs and stickers.But many of those sites including Twitter and Pintrest are direct competitors to Facebook.A Graphical Interchange Format or GIF is an animated image or short soundless video that plays on a continuous loop without requiring the viewer to press play.They are often used on social media or messaging app to convey an emotion or joke.Mr Shah wrote Giphy's animated images made ""conversations more entertaining"" and said its library would be integrated into Instagram and Facebook's other platforms.Giphy is one of the largest sites for creating these images and storing them. Its main competitor is Imgur. Facebook said 50% of Giphy's traffic already came from its platforms and half of that was from Instagram.The purchase comes at a time when Facebook has seen increased users due to Covid-19 lockdown orders. But, in the months preceding the global pandemic the social media giant had been facing increased scrutiny from US regulators over antitrust concerns and that it had too much control over the social media space.

Google spotlights more suspected Oculus VR gadget-scam ads,"Fresh evidence that scam stores are exploiting Google's Shopping service to appear at the top of its search results has been discovered by the BBC.Two sites offering hard-to-find gadgets at a discount were found to be using bogus checkout facilities that encourage customers to pay via a direct bank transfer.This prevents users from recovering funds if they have second thoughts. Police investigators have expressed frustration about Google's role.One officer who spent years investigating online crime told the BBC that the tech firm could introduce checks to better deter fraudsters, if it made this a priority.Google believes the sites were indeed engaged in fraudulent behaviour and told the BBC it had removed the ads involved. It said it would now make unspecified changes to its automated and human-based review processes.""Our priority is to protect our users, and we continue to update our enforcement policies and technologies to target fraudulent and bad actors,"" a spokeswoman said.""In 2019, our team took down approximately 2.7 billion bad ads.""Both Techziox.com and Shopzeal.co.uk went offline after the BBC contacted them. They did not respond to requests for comment.The sites had earlier run ads for Oculus virtual-reality headsets, which are sold out or priced at a premium on most other sites. The two stores claimed to have the products in stock and priced them at 15-23% below the norm.In some cases, the ads took up most of the screen when viewed on a smartphone, increasing their chance of being clicked.This mirrored the tactics of an earlier suspected scam site - MyTechDomestic - which also placed ads for Oculus headsets and was flagged to Google earlier this week.But while MyTechDomestic only presented shoppers a way to pay by bank transfer, Techziox and Shopzeal both appear to provide an option to use a credit card.If selected, the tool asks for the card's details including its CVV security code, and displays a ""Powered by Stripe"" logo - referring to a California-based internet payment processor.However, Stripe told the BBC that the box was not linked to its system and it did not handle payments for the sites. An independent security researcher, who tracks scam sites, confirmed that the sites' code indicated the card details were instead sent to the stores' operators.In any case, when users tried to use the service, it brought up an error message saying: ""Unfortunately, this payment method is not possible for new customers. Please choose another payment method.""The only other choice was bank transfer, and both Techziox and Shopzeal presented details of the same account at a Swindon-based bank.This is a common tactic used by scam sites to obtain funds. In previous cases, the police have said scammers use personal accounts belonging to individuals who are either complicit or have been coerced into sharing their bank details, and the money is typically withdrawn straight away over the counter or via cash machines.The two sites were both built using Wordpress's web-publishing software, looked similar and listed the same team members alongside email addresses that did not work.However, they gave different residential addresses as their respective headquarters - one in Southampton the other in Huddersfield - and used different domain registrars.They also provided different VAT numbers. In both cases, HM Revenue and Customs said the details were invalid.Techziox appears to have been in operation for longer, and had been accused of being ""straight-up scammers"" by users of Trustpilot's review site.One customer, Nicky Jones, told the BBC her 15-year-old daughter attempted to buy an Oculus Quest after saving for a long time and doing jobs to earn the cash.""My daughter searched online and this company came up, so we purchased the item. I sent emails to the company and I had no emails back,"" she said.""The most upsetting thing is we have lost £329. I would never take this money from my daughter, so I have lost the money. [It's] upsetting how people can do this and get away with this. It's wrong.""According to Whois records, Techziox's site was set up using a Netherlands-based registrar on 18 April, while Shopzeal used a US-based registrar on 7 May.A security blogger who anonymously tracks electronics goods scams said: ""It's horrendous. This is the first time I've seen them use Google Shopping. Previously it was just Adwords.""Google Shopping lets advertisers use images as well as words and is typically more prominent, he noted.Scam sites can be ""difficult to identify,"" he added. ""But maybe Google shouldn't allow a website that's been registered in the last two months to be one of its Shopping results, if it wants to provide a trustworthy customer experience.""",15 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Film piracy streaming trebles in lockdown,"Newly released films have been downloaded illegally in huge numbers since stay-at-home lockdown measures were imposed in the UK.According to Fact, the UK's intellectual property protection organisation, overall links to illegal streaming sites doubled between February and April.And for some recently released films, it had trebled.Kieron Sharp, chief executive of Fact, said it was no surprise.""It's essential to remember that the only legal way of watching films is through the official providers.""Every pirated link that we detect denies the rights holder of revenue they are entitled to, and also threatens investment in future content.""Fact did not name the films that had seen particular spikes in streaming but did encourage people to report illegal sources they come across to Crimestoppers.Its findings are reflected in other studies.Piracy-tracking firm Muso found traffic to illegal streaming and download sites rose by nearly 60% during March. It noted more than 300 million visits to piracy sites in the UK, and more than one billion in the US.Oscar-winning film Parasite saw demand rise 240% on illegal streaming sites at the start of the pandemic. The 2011 film, Contagion, about a virus outbreak, saw a rise in piracy streaming visits of 151%.",15 May 2020,technology
Facebook to build internet cable 'circumference of Earth',"Facebook is teaming up with telecoms companies to build a 37,000km (23,000-mile) undersea cable to supply faster internet to 16 countries in Africa.Its length - almost equal to the circumference of the Earth - will make it one of the longest, it said.It is part of a long-running bid by Facebook to take its social media platform to Africa's young population.Ready for use by 2024, it will deliver three times the capacity of all current undersea cables serving Africa.""When completed, this new route will deliver much-needed internet capacity, redundancy, and reliability across Africa, supplement a rapidly increasing demand for capacity in the Middle East, and support further growth of 4G, 5G, and broadband access for hundreds of millions of people,"" said Facebook in a blog.Africa lags behind the rest of the world when it comes to internet access, with four in 10 people across the continent having access to the web, compared with a global average of six in 10.But the continent represents huge opportunities for technology firms and businesses with its population of 1.3 billion.The cost of the 2Africa project - which will connect Europe and the Middle East to the continent - has not been disclosed but Bloomberg reported it could be close to $1bn (£820m).Sub-sea cables carry the vast majority of the world's inter-continental data. They can handle much more data and offer faster transmission at a lower cost compared with other methods. The cable - which will be built by Nokia Oyj's Alcatel Submarine Networks - will run along the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea.It will be buried deeper than previous systems for greater protection against external damage from things such as ships' anchors.The fibre-optic cables will have double the capacity of older ones, making use of Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM1) technology.Facebook is teaming up with Johannesburg-based MTN Group, Telecom Egypt, Vodafone and Orange SA.Vodafone said it would pave the way for developing digital businesses on the continent.""We need to ensure that there is enough internet capacity to not only get people online, but to help build a modern digital society that includes services that require a large amount of data transfer, such as cloud computing or video,"" said Nick Gliddon, director of Vodafone Carrier Services.As well as helping businesses, it will also improve healthcare and education, he added.",15 May 2020,technology

Facebook buys GIF-maker Giphy to add to Instagram team,"Facebook has purchased the GIF-maker Giphy and plans to make it part of the Instagram team.A report from Axios values the deal at $400m (£330m), but Facebook would not confirm the final price.In a blog post, Instagram's VP of Products Vishal Shah said third party firms would still have access to Giphy's library of GIFs and stickers.But many of those sites including Twitter and Pintrest are direct competitors to Facebook.A Graphical Interchange Format or GIF is an animated image or short soundless video that plays on a continuous loop without requiring the viewer to press play.They are often used on social media or messaging app to convey an emotion or joke.Mr Shah wrote Giphy's animated images made ""conversations more entertaining"" and said its library would be integrated into Instagram and Facebook's other platforms.Giphy is one of the largest sites for creating these images and storing them. Its main competitor is Imgur. Facebook said 50% of Giphy's traffic already came from its platforms and half of that was from Instagram.The purchase comes at a time when Facebook has seen increased users due to Covid-19 lockdown orders. But, in the months preceding the global pandemic the social media giant had been facing increased scrutiny from US regulators over antitrust concerns and that it had too much control over the social media space.

Google spotlights more suspected Oculus VR gadget-scam ads,"Fresh evidence that scam stores are exploiting Google's Shopping service to appear at the top of its search results has been discovered by the BBC.Two sites offering hard-to-find gadgets at a discount were found to be using bogus checkout facilities that encourage customers to pay via a direct bank transfer.This prevents users from recovering funds if they have second thoughts. Police investigators have expressed frustration about Google's role.One officer who spent years investigating online crime told the BBC that the tech firm could introduce checks to better deter fraudsters, if it made this a priority.Google believes the sites were indeed engaged in fraudulent behaviour and told the BBC it had removed the ads involved. It said it would now make unspecified changes to its automated and human-based review processes.""Our priority is to protect our users, and we continue to update our enforcement policies and technologies to target fraudulent and bad actors,"" a spokeswoman said.""In 2019, our team took down approximately 2.7 billion bad ads.""Both Techziox.com and Shopzeal.co.uk went offline after the BBC contacted them. They did not respond to requests for comment.The sites had earlier run ads for Oculus virtual-reality headsets, which are sold out or priced at a premium on most other sites. The two stores claimed to have the products in stock and priced them at 15-23% below the norm.In some cases, the ads took up most of the screen when viewed on a smartphone, increasing their chance of being clicked.This mirrored the tactics of an earlier suspected scam site - MyTechDomestic - which also placed ads for Oculus headsets and was flagged to Google earlier this week.But while MyTechDomestic only presented shoppers a way to pay by bank transfer, Techziox and Shopzeal both appear to provide an option to use a credit card.If selected, the tool asks for the card's details including its CVV security code, and displays a ""Powered by Stripe"" logo - referring to a California-based internet payment processor.However, Stripe told the BBC that the box was not linked to its system and it did not handle payments for the sites. An independent security researcher, who tracks scam sites, confirmed that the sites' code indicated the card details were instead sent to the stores' operators.In any case, when users tried to use the service, it brought up an error message saying: ""Unfortunately, this payment method is not possible for new customers. Please choose another payment method.""The only other choice was bank transfer, and both Techziox and Shopzeal presented details of the same account at a Swindon-based bank.This is a common tactic used by scam sites to obtain funds. In previous cases, the police have said scammers use personal accounts belonging to individuals who are either complicit or have been coerced into sharing their bank details, and the money is typically withdrawn straight away over the counter or via cash machines.The two sites were both built using Wordpress's web-publishing software, looked similar and listed the same team members alongside email addresses that did not work.However, they gave different residential addresses as their respective headquarters - one in Southampton the other in Huddersfield - and used different domain registrars.They also provided different VAT numbers. In both cases, HM Revenue and Customs said the details were invalid.Techziox appears to have been in operation for longer, and had been accused of being ""straight-up scammers"" by users of Trustpilot's review site.One customer, Nicky Jones, told the BBC her 15-year-old daughter attempted to buy an Oculus Quest after saving for a long time and doing jobs to earn the cash.""My daughter searched online and this company came up, so we purchased the item. I sent emails to the company and I had no emails back,"" she said.""The most upsetting thing is we have lost £329. I would never take this money from my daughter, so I have lost the money. [It's] upsetting how people can do this and get away with this. It's wrong.""According to Whois records, Techziox's site was set up using a Netherlands-based registrar on 18 April, while Shopzeal used a US-based registrar on 7 May.A security blogger who anonymously tracks electronics goods scams said: ""It's horrendous. This is the first time I've seen them use Google Shopping. Previously it was just Adwords.""Google Shopping lets advertisers use images as well as words and is typically more prominent, he noted.Scam sites can be ""difficult to identify,"" he added.

Facebook to build internet cable 'circumference of Earth',"Facebook is teaming up with telecoms companies to build a 37,000km (23,000-mile) undersea cable to supply faster internet to 16 countries in Africa.Its length - almost equal to the circumference of the Earth - will make it one of the longest, it said.It is part of a long-running bid by Facebook to take its social media platform to Africa's young population.Ready for use by 2024, it will deliver three times the capacity of all current undersea cables serving Africa.""When completed, this new route will deliver much-needed internet capacity, redundancy, and reliability across Africa, supplement a rapidly increasing demand for capacity in the Middle East, and support further growth of 4G, 5G, and broadband access for hundreds of millions of people,"" said Facebook in a blog.Africa lags behind the rest of the world when it comes to internet access, with four in 10 people across the continent having access to the web, compared with a global average of six in 10.But the continent represents huge opportunities for technology firms and businesses with its population of 1.3 billion.The cost of the 2Africa project - which will connect Europe and the Middle East to the continent - has not been disclosed but Bloomberg reported it could be close to $1bn (£820m).Sub-sea cables carry the vast majority of the world's inter-continental data. They can handle much more data and offer faster transmission at a lower cost compared with other methods. The cable - which will be built by Nokia Oyj's Alcatel Submarine Networks - will run along the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea.It will be buried deeper than previous systems for greater protection against external damage from things such as ships' anchors.The fibre-optic cables will have double the capacity of older ones, making use of Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM1) technology.Facebook is teaming up with Johannesburg-based MTN Group, Telecom Egypt, Vodafone and Orange SA.Vodafone said it would pave the way for developing digital businesses on the continent.""We need to ensure that there is enough internet capacity to not only get people online, but to help build a modern digital society that includes services that require a large amount of data transfer, such as cloud computing or video,"" said Nick Gliddon, director of Vodafone Carrier Services.As well as helping businesses, it will also improve healthcare and education, he added.",15 May 2020,technology
Glastonbury 5G report 'hijacked by conspiracy theorists',"Last month, the town council of Glastonbury in Somerset published a report calling for a government inquiry into the safety of 5G.It promised to oppose the rollout of the next-generation mobile networks in the town. Now, three members of the group that produced the report have told the BBC they resigned because it was taken over by anti-5G activists and ""spiritual healers"".They fear it could lend credibility to conspiracy theories, such as 5G being linked to the spread of coronavirus.""The whole thing was completely biased from the beginning,"" says Mark Swann, one of those who resigned. ""Genuine scientific expertise has been scorned in favour of conspiracy and hearsay,"" wrote David Swain in his letter of resignation. 5G is the next generation of mobile phone technology. It promises faster downloads and increased capacity.The radio waves involved in 5G  - and the previous generation networks - sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not energetic enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum, which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays.Get the facts: BBC Reality CheckThe report, published after a six-month inquiry, said the council would oppose the rollout of 5G, while accepting it had no power to halt it.Glastonbury's 5G Advisory Committee was made up of nine councillors, and nine local residents who responded to adverts calling for people with relevant experience to help decide whether 5G was safe.Among the volunteers were:All four ended up resigning before the report was completed.""I joined the working group in good faith, expecting to take part in a sensible discussion about 5G,"" says Mr Swann. ""Sadly the whole thing turned out to be a clueless pantomime driven by conspiracy theorists and sceptics."" Mr Cooper reached the same conclusion: ""I worked out there were only four of us who were neutral. And the others were all absolutely against 5G, either strongly or weakly.""Most of the evidence the committee heard was from witnesses who had stated their support for a moratorium on the rollout of 5G. They included retired American professor Martin Pall, who in 2019 claimed that wireless networks would make all human beings sterile if they were not switched off within two years. Another witness was Dr Andrew Tresidder, a former GP whose website offers flower remedies and emotional healing. His presentation focused on people claiming to suffer from ""electromagnetic stress"", which he said was often not taken seriously by mainstream doctors.Committee member Roy Procter, a spiritual healer who claims dowsing can heal ""sick houses"", also gave a presentation. In the report, he speculates about a link between the coronavirus and 5G, and recommends that the council eliminate all wi-fi connections.The committee's chairman, Councillor Jon Cousins, told the BBC he strongly disagrees with the suggestion that the meetings were biased towards pseudo-science. ""Equal weight was given to all contributions,"" he says, adding that councillors ""were able to take into account the prejudice, predetermination and bias displayed on all sides of the argument"".In the report, Mr Cousins said Glastonbury had punched above its weight, and other councils had been in touch about its recommendations.But both Mr Swann and Mr Cooper were particularly concerned about the role of an external member of the committee. Christopher Baker was instrumental in choosing witnesses to appear before the committee. He also gave his own presentation in which he attacked the credibility of ICNIRP, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, the body which sets the safety standards for mobile network emissions.Mr Baker has campaigned against 5G across the south-west. Before the committee was formed, he had been lobbying Glastonbury councillors to ban the technology. In a Facebook post in May 2019, he outlined his campaigning activities and bemoaned the lack of support from residents.""The only thing that is missing is the support from the community! I can't do this for you on my own, this is about you and for you,"" he said.But in a YouTube video posted in July, he tells another anti-5G activist how he helped convince Glastonbury Town Council to get the investigation underway. He encouraged others to organise local petitions.He has also appeared in videos alongside Mark Steele, another anti-5G conspiracy theorist who claims the coronavirus is a hoax, and has posted videos of himself harassing telecoms engineers. Mr Cooper says the committee was supposed to be made up of people who lived in the area or had a business there. He complained that Christopher Baker did not meet those requirements because he lived in Hampshire, which does not even border Somerset.He resigned after the complaint was ignored, describing Mr Baker as a ""semi-professional anti-5G activist"". He highlighted a video in which Mr Baker admitted some of his fuel costs were paid by a benefactor.Mr Baker told the BBC it was true that he lived in Hampshire, but said he had long-term connections to Glastonbury, and in any case other members of the committee were from outside the town. He admitted that he did receive some funding from a benefactor he refused to name. ""I don't have a lot of money, and if I travel half-way up the country to give a presentation, the least I expect is someone to contribute something towards my fuel bill.""He said those who resigned from the committee were dismissive of the evidence, rude to witnesses such as Prof Pall, and a disruptive force at the meetings.

Coronavirus: Amazon to make face shields and sell at cost,"Amazon says it will produce hundreds of thousands of face shields for medics and sell them at cost price in the US.The internet giant said engineers from its drone and hardware divisions had been tasked with developing the product.At first, it will sell them to healthcare professionals, before making them available to all Amazon customers.Amazon is not the first major US firm to use its resources to produce personal protective equipment (PPE). Apple began sending face shields to hospitals in March. Space X, HP and Ford also used their manufacturing resources to make and donate face shields and other types of protective equipment. Amazon said that it had donated 10,000 face shields in the US and was ""on track"" to deliver a further 20,000. But its plan to sell them at low prices on its website will make them available to the general public, something other firms have not done. A look on Amazon's marketplace on Thursday showed face shields sold by independent sellers were priced between $12 (£9.80) and $35.Once Amazon makes its mask available to all its customers, it could drive the price down significantly. The online retail giant has faced criticism for undercutting the prices of independent retailers on its sites, but anti-trust experts say its efforts to help in this crisis will likely offset those concerns. ""People who are concerned about Amazon's predatory behaviour might be concerned but more people will be happy Amazon is making sure these are lower cost at a time of crisis,"" said Michael Kades, director of markets and competition at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.The company said it based its designs on a face shield developed by a community of 3D printing enthusiasts in Washington. After making some changes, its designs had been approved by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).Engineers from Amazon's drone division specialising in hardware design created a new design within a week that improved the quality of the materials to allow them to be reusable and added an enhanced snap feature to keep the shield in-place to make them safer.The engineers also amended the geometry of the shields to reduce sharp edges that could snag clothing or hair, thinned the forehead band to reduce pressure on a person's forehead, and drastically improved print time making them quicker to manufacture.Amazon's Brad Porter wrote in a blog post: ""Because of the design innovations and the capabilities of our supply chain, we are confident we will be able to list them at a significantly lower price - almost a third of the cost - than all other reusable face shields currently available to frontline workers.""The internet giant is also making its designs - known as the origami design and brimmed design - open source so that the shields could be 3D printed by anyone. Both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the British Standards Institution (BSI) have warned that homemade and 3D printed face shields do not always protect healthcare workers' faces from exposure to the coronavirus. But the global shortage of PPE has led to an increasing number of frontline medical workers crafting homemade equipment.   Amazon did not say whether it would provide the masks to workers at its warehouse who have reported a lack of safety equipment during the coronavirus pandemic. ",14 May 2020,technology
Grand Theft Auto free download crashes Epic Games store,"The Epic Games store experienced glitches on Thursday as fans rushed to download a free copy of Grand Theft Auto V.Within minutes of making the game free online the swell of demand caused the site to slow and send error messages.Epic blamed the slowdown on ""heavy traffic"" and said it was working to fix the problem.Grand Theft Auto, known as GTA to fans, is made by Rockstar Games and is one of the top selling gaming franchises. Every week Epic Games makes a 'mystery game' available without charge on its store. The games are available for PCs or Macs. Users who download the week's mystery game can keep it forever, even when the free to download period expires.On Wednesday it was announced Grand Theft Auto V would be this week's game. The game became available at 11:00 EDT (15:00 GMT). Within minutes of the launch users began to report slowdowns and error messages. On Twitter, the company tried to calm fans. We are currently experiencing high traffic on the Epic Games Store. We are aware that users may be encountering slow loading times, 500 errors, or launcher crashing at this time and we are actively working to scale. We'll provide an update as soon as we can.End of Twitter post  by @EpicGamesEpic Games attributed the slowdown to high demand.Grand Theft Auto V has earned more than any other single game ever released, according to MarketWatch. More than 100 million copies have been sold since its release in 2013.  The slowdown and crashes appear to have lasted several hours and caused problems on other Epic platforms as well.Fortnite, which is made by Epic, appeared to be having trouble with its launcher and the mobile game Battle Breakers was also exercising issues.The offer to download Grand Theft Auto V runs through 21 May. In January, Epic Games said it planned to give away free games each week through 2020.Such offers attempt to boost revenues by drawing gamers to online stores. ",15 May 2020,technology
France gives online firms one hour to pull 'terrorist' content,"Social media and other websites will have just one hour to delete offending content under a new law passed by France's parliament.The one-hour deadline applies to content that French authorities consider to be related to terrorism or child sexual abuse.Failing to act could result in fines of up to 4% of global revenue -  billions of euros for the largest online firms.But critics say the new law could restrict freedom of expression.The new rules apply to all websites, whether large or small. But there are concerns that only internet giants such as Facebook and Google actually have the resources to remove content as quickly as required.Digital rights group La Quadrature du Net said the requirement to take down content that the police considered ""terrorism"" in just one hour was impractical.""Except the big companies, nobody can afford to have a 24/7 watch to remove the content when requested,"" a spokesman for the group said. ""Hence, they will have to rely on censorship before receiving a request from the police.""That might be in the form of using an automatic system provided by the largest companies, giving them ""more power on what can exist on the web or not"".But there are also fears that such tech could be used against groups such as protesters.""Since 2015, we already had such a law that allowed the police to ask for the removal of some content if they deemed it to be terrorist... this has been used multiple times in France to censor political content,"" the spokesman said.""Giving the police such a power, without any control... is obviously for us an infringement on the freedom of speech.""France's new law reflects one proposed at the European Union level, where law-makers last year suggested a one-hour deadline for the removal of content.But that proposal proved controversial and is currently in limbo.France pushed ahead with its own version of the law despite the concerns in Europe.Under the new French law, content judged to be illegal - but not relating to terrorism or child sexual abuse - will have to be taken down within 24 hours of notification.That includes posts inciting hatred, violence, racism, and sexual harassment. Failure to remove content could attract a fine of up to €1.25m (£1.1m). France's regulator, the Superior Council of the Audiovisual (CSA), will have the power to impose heftier fines of up to 4% of global turnover for continuous and repeated violations.Laetitia Avia, the MP from President Macron's LREM party who proposed the bill, said the law would protect victims, while reaffirming the country's commitment to freedom of expression.However, France's Republicans party voted against the measure.Member Constance Le Grip told the National Assembly that fighting online hatred could not come at the expense of freedom of expression. Her colleague in the Senate Bruno Retailleau tweeted that the new law was ""incompatible with respect for public freedoms"".Facebook said it was working closely with French regulator CSA and others ""on the implementation of this law"".YouTube said it already tackled illegal content and welcomed any new partnership with governments.Twitter's head of public affairs in France, Audrey Herblin-Stoop, told Reuters that the company would continue to work with the government to fight illegal content and hate speech.",14 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus contact-tracing: World split between two types of app,"Countries around the world are developing Covid-19 smartphone apps to limit the spread of coronavirus and relax lockdown restrictions. It's hoped the information they gather can be used to alert people whether they pose a risk of spreading the contagion, and need to isolate. But, over recent weeks, a split has emerged between two different types of app - the so-called centralised and decentralised versions.Both types use Bluetooth signals to log when smartphone owners are close to each other - so if someone develops Covid-19 symptoms, an alert can be sent to other users they may have infected.Under the centralised model, the anonymised data gathered is uploaded to a remote server where matches are made with other contacts, should a person start to develop Covid-19 symptoms.This is the method the UK is pursuing. By contrast, the decentralised model gives users more control over their information by keeping it on the phone. It is there that matches are made with people who may have contracted the virus. This is the model promoted by Google, Apple and an international consortium.Both sides have their fans. Backers of the centralised model say it can give the authorities more insight into the spread of the virus and how well the app is performing. Supporters of the decentralised approach say it offers users a higher degree of privacy, protecting them from hackers or the state itself revealing their social contacts.In truth, both are unproven at this stage. South Korea, seen as one of the most successful countries at tackling Covid-19, has done it without a contact-tracing app. It has however used other surveillance methods which would be seen as invasive by many.At the start, the centralised approach was seen to be pioneering. Singapore's TraceTogether was widely viewed as the one to emulate. But that changed after it emerged the app was only being used by about 20% of the local population, and there had been a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.Part of the problem is that TraceTogether does not work properly when in the background on iPhones because of the way Apple restricts use of Bluetooth. The firm has promised to waive these curbs, but only if apps fall into line with its decentralised system. Singapore has since signalled it will do so as a result.""We are working with Apple and Google to make the app more effective, especially for iOS users,"" a spokesman told the BBC.Australia, another early adopter of the centralised approach, launched its CovidSafe app based on TraceTogether, and faced similar issues as a consequence. It has said it plans to adopt the Apple-Google framework, citing a ""big shift in performance of Bluetooth connectivity"". And on Wednesday, Colombia confirmed it too was considering a switch after having to turn off the contact-tracing feature in its CoronApp.""[We need to] minimise the risk of generating unnecessary alerts,"" said presidential advisor Victor Munoz.Others, though, are still forging ahead with the centralised approach. France's digital minister has said it intends to launch its StopCovid app by 2 June, and is attempting to press Apple into a U-turn of its own.""Apple could have helped us make the application work even better on the iPhone,"" said digital minister Cédric O on Tuesday. ""They have wished not to do so. I regret this.""But he faces internal resistance from one of the government's own human rights bodies, which has described the design as being ""dangerous"" and warned it may try to block its adoption.Norway has already adopted a centralised design for its Smittestopp app, which went live last month in three municipalities. In addition to Bluetooth readings, it also collects GPS location data.The developer claims that the combination of the two leads to ""very accurate contact tracing results without the need for [the Google-Apple interface"".But this has raised privacy concerns, which may have contributed to a fairly high drop-out rate. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said that as of 28 April, 1.5 million people had downloaded the app, but only 899,142 were actively using it - representing just 20.5% of over-16s in the test zones.India's contact-tracing app, Aaroya Setu, takes a similar approach to Norway's. To tackle adoption, the government has ruled all government and private sector workers must use it.Until Apple and Google release their interface, known as an API, it's impossible to be sure their system will be any more successful. But the list of nations flocking to it keeps growing. Germany surprised many when it confirmed it had been convinced decentralisation was the way to go - it had previously seemed set to go hand-in-hand with France.Poland's forthcoming app may also be about to abandon its centralised plan before launch.""We assume that adapting ProteGo Safe to Google and Apple APIs will be necessary,"" developers' notes read. ""We assume that adapting… to Google and Apple APIs will be necessary.""Italy's Immuni announced it too was backing the US tech giants' initiative on 29 April, praising its stronger guarantee of anonymity. Other countries set to do likewise include:Luxembourg's MPs are about to vote on a decentralised approach. And the BBC has also been told Greece is about to adopt a similar position.Why does all this matter? There may be problems trying to make the two different types of system talk to each other.""The core reason is that centralised systems ask you to upload the people you have seen, and decentralised systems don't need that data, so they don't play well together,"" explained Dr Michael Veale of the DP3T group, which supports a similar system to Apple and Google.""So if you see an app as an important part of reducing lockdown, then you remove the ability to trace the virus as it crosses borders, and viruses don't respect borders.""",7 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Will offices be safe for a return to work?,"As lockdowns start to ease in many countries, so the tentative return to work begins, leaving people understandably concerned about how safe a space an office will be in the middle of a global pandemic.Alongside some mouldy old food in the communal fridges, there is likely to be an increase in the amount of technology used to monitor employees.From thermal cameras taking your temperature when you enter the building to apps or wearables to alert you if you get too close to colleagues, work could soon have the feel of the Minority Report movie.The Edge in Amsterdam was voted one of the smartest and most sustainable buildings in the world a few years ago, and it is adapting its sensor-packed offices to the new reality of living with a contagious and potentially life-threatening virus.Coen van Oostrom, the founder of the real-estate firm that built it, told the BBC that there are a couple of ""no brainer"" changes that can happen immediately.""The doors can currently be opened by hand but it is a small step to be able to open them by voice control or via an app, and we want to do that to make sure the virus isn't spreading that way.""We also have cameras that can see how many people are on a floor and with a software update they are also able to measure how far people are away from each other, and we can send a warning to people's phones if they are too close to each other.""Not everyone likes it and there is a feeling that it is an intrusion on their privacy, so we haven't decided yet if we want to use it when everyone is back in the office.""The Edge, unlike most buildings, already provides employees with a phone app that allows them to see what temperature the office is and what air quality is like, as well as allowing them to order their lunch from the canteen.Take-up hasn't been huge. While in the past no one really cared about air quality, now that the chances of the virus spreading are higher if not enough fresh air is circulating, people might start taking notice of it, thinks Mr van Oostrom.Seating plans will also have to change to make sure social distancing rules can be enforced but Susan Clarke, a smart buildings expert with research firm Verdantix, thinks employers are unlikely to radically alter their working practices.""Hot-desking will remain and given the recession we are moving into right now, most firms won't be able to take on more space - but it might be re-thought, so as one person checks out of a desk, a work order is assigned to that area so a cleaner can do some disinfecting.""Some lighting firms, such as Vital Vio, are offering what they describe as safe disinfection lighting, which uses violet light mixed with white light to kill some bacteria on surfaces. While these might have a use in hotels or very high occupancy offices, the expense may not be justifiable to many businesses, thinks Ms Clarke.Flir Technology has been making thermal cameras for use in airports and on board police helicopters for years, but has seen exponential growth in the last few months.Now the firm is seeing interest from factories and businesses.""Basically, every industry that needs to protect its workers and its customers,"" said Flir's vice president of marketing for Flir, Ezra Merrill.The cameras measure a five millimetre square area near the tear duct, which has been judged the best place to record skin temperature. Users wearing spectacles have to remove them.Its algorithms take account of a range of factors, such as time of day, whether it is sunny or raining, as well as the fact that people have a range of normal body temperature.But the device is just one part of the puzzle, and a second step would be to take a person's temperature using a medical grade thermometer, said Mr Merrill.The technology was recently tested at a US factory, where reaction from employees was mixed.""It was a full range as you'd expect, from people who were excited and happy to do it to those who thought they were getting a retina scan.""In fact the camera does not take a picture at all and it is not possible to identify people from the image, but Mr Merrill acknowledges there could be privacy issues. And in some places it could be illegal.""Some countries prohibit employee health monitoring. In Italy for example there are laws stating that you can't monitor health, and that includes parameters such as temperature,"" said Ms Clarke.Lawyer Ravi Naik said businesses have to be careful they are not using ""tech for tech's sake"".""Is this to facilitate an understanding of who can work and who can't, and if not what is the significance of it? Because it is such an interference with basic human rights that there has to be a high level of evidential justification to deploy this tech, and I just don't think that is the case right now.""The radical, long-term solution might involve not having to go into a building at all.Barclays Bank's chief executive Jes Staley has said that having thousands of workers in big expensive city offices ""may be a thing of the past"" as the home-working lockdown era proves many can do their jobs perfectly well at home.As a real estate developer, Mr van Oostrom obviously disagrees.He thinks we will see a hybrid model with more people working from home and employers having ""to seduce people to come into the office"". ""Making offices fun places to be will be more important than ever,"" he said.",7 May 2020,technology
Glastonbury 5G report 'hijacked by conspiracy theorists',"Last month, the town council of Glastonbury in Somerset published a report calling for a government inquiry into the safety of 5G.It promised to oppose the rollout of the next-generation mobile networks in the town. Now, three members of the group that produced the report have told the BBC they resigned because it was taken over by anti-5G activists and ""spiritual healers"".They fear it could lend credibility to conspiracy theories, such as 5G being linked to the spread of coronavirus.""The whole thing was completely biased from the beginning,"" says Mark Swann, one of those who resigned. ""Genuine scientific expertise has been scorned in favour of conspiracy and hearsay,"" wrote David Swain in his letter of resignation. 5G is the next generation of mobile phone technology. It promises faster downloads and increased capacity.The radio waves involved in 5G  - and the previous generation networks - sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not energetic enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum, which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays.Get the facts: BBC Reality CheckThe report, published after a six-month inquiry, said the council would oppose the rollout of 5G, while accepting it had no power to halt it.Glastonbury's 5G Advisory Committee was made up of nine councillors, and nine local residents who responded to adverts calling for people with relevant experience to help decide whether 5G was safe.Among the volunteers were:All four ended up resigning before the report was completed.""I joined the working group in good faith, expecting to take part in a sensible discussion about 5G,"" says Mr Swann. ""Sadly the whole thing turned out to be a clueless pantomime driven by conspiracy theorists and sceptics."" Mr Cooper reached the same conclusion: ""I worked out there were only four of us who were neutral. And the others were all absolutely against 5G, either strongly or weakly.""Most of the evidence the committee heard was from witnesses who had stated their support for a moratorium on the rollout of 5G. They included retired American professor Martin Pall, who in 2019 claimed that wireless networks would make all human beings sterile if they were not switched off within two years. Another witness was Dr Andrew Tresidder, a former GP whose website offers flower remedies and emotional healing. His presentation focused on people claiming to suffer from ""electromagnetic stress"", which he said was often not taken seriously by mainstream doctors.Committee member Roy Procter, a spiritual healer who claims dowsing can heal ""sick houses"", also gave a presentation. In the report, he speculates about a link between the coronavirus and 5G, and recommends that the council eliminate all wi-fi connections.The committee's chairman, Councillor Jon Cousins, told the BBC he strongly disagrees with the suggestion that the meetings were biased towards pseudo-science. ""Equal weight was given to all contributions,"" he says, adding that councillors ""were able to take into account the prejudice, predetermination and bias displayed on all sides of the argument"".In the report, Mr Cousins said Glastonbury had punched above its weight, and other councils had been in touch about its recommendations.But both Mr Swann and Mr Cooper were particularly concerned about the role of an external member of the committee. Christopher Baker was instrumental in choosing witnesses to appear before the committee. He also gave his own presentation in which he attacked the credibility of ICNIRP, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, the body which sets the safety standards for mobile network emissions.Mr Baker has campaigned against 5G across the south-west. Before the committee was formed, he had been lobbying Glastonbury councillors to ban the technology. In a Facebook post in May 2019, he outlined his campaigning activities and bemoaned the lack of support from residents.""The only thing that is missing is the support from the community! I can't do this for you on my own, this is about you and for you,"" he said.But in a YouTube video posted in July, he tells another anti-5G activist how he helped convince Glastonbury Town Council to get the investigation underway. He encouraged others to organise local petitions.He has also appeared in videos alongside Mark Steele, another anti-5G conspiracy theorist who claims the coronavirus is a hoax, and has posted videos of himself harassing telecoms engineers. Mr Cooper says the committee was supposed to be made up of people who lived in the area or had a business there. He complained that Christopher Baker did not meet those requirements because he lived in Hampshire, which does not even border Somerset.He resigned after the complaint was ignored, describing Mr Baker as a ""semi-professional anti-5G activist"". He highlighted a video in which Mr Baker admitted some of his fuel costs were paid by a benefactor.Mr Baker told the BBC it was true that he lived in Hampshire, but said he had long-term connections to Glastonbury, and in any case other members of the committee were from outside the town. He admitted that he did receive some funding from a benefactor he refused to name. ""I don't have a lot of money, and if I travel half-way up the country to give a presentation, the least I expect is someone to contribute something towards my fuel bill.""He said those who resigned from the committee were dismissive of the evidence, rude to witnesses such as Prof Pall, and a disruptive force at the meetings. Committee chair Jon Cousins agreed: ""Some of the behaviours displayed by non-councillor members when they could not debate by 'reason' broke Glastonbury Town Council's code of conduct.""This is strongly denied by Mark Swann and his colleagues.The committee did hear evidence from Mobile UK, the mobile operators' trade body. Its presentation was criticised by one member for being ""glossy"", and others alleged there was no attempt to answer questions. Gareth Elliott of Mobile UK denied that: ""We answered everything that was asked of us."" However, he said it was a cordial meeting and his organisation respected the views of the committee.He recounts an incident where one committee member arrived late to a meeting. She said that although she was hyper-sensitive to electromagnetic emissions, she deemed the meeting room to be safe. ""It was then noted that a wi-fi router was operating and was in the room,"" he says.Those who resigned from the committee say they are concerned about the reputation of Glastonbury. Last month, Piers Corbyn - the brother of the former Labour leader - led an anti-lockdown protest in the town, where slogans against 5G were shouted. Mr Swann says the atmosphere in the town has been tense lately and he is worried about the impact of the 5G report.""This fallacious report severely damages Glastonbury's credibility,"" he says. ""It undermines years of good work by well-meaning councillors and leaves a dark shadow over the town's  reputation.""But Councillor Jon Cousins rejects the idea that the report may have served to encourage the conspiracy theorists. ""Glastonbury Town Council's position and resolutions around 5G do not - and have never - suggested a link between 5G and Covid-19 or indeed that coronavirus is a hoax."" He says the council worked closely with Avon and Somerset Police to deal with last month's demonstration and breaches of social distancing legislation.",16 May 2020,technology
Facebook buys GIF-maker Giphy to add to Instagram team,"Facebook has purchased the GIF-maker Giphy and plans to make it part of the Instagram team.A report from Axios values the deal at $400m (£330m), but Facebook would not confirm the final price.In a blog post, Instagram's VP of Products Vishal Shah said third party firms would still have access to Giphy's library of GIFs and stickers.But many of those sites including Twitter and Pintrest are direct competitors to Facebook.A Graphical Interchange Format or GIF is an animated image or short soundless video that plays on a continuous loop without requiring the viewer to press play.They are often used on social media or messaging app to convey an emotion or joke.Mr Shah wrote Giphy's animated images made ""conversations more entertaining"" and said its library would be integrated into Instagram and Facebook's other platforms.Giphy is one of the largest sites for creating these images and storing them. Its main competitor is Imgur. Facebook said 50% of Giphy's traffic already came from its platforms and half of that was from Instagram.The purchase comes at a time when Facebook has seen increased users due to Covid-19 lockdown orders. But, in the months preceding the global pandemic the social media giant had been facing increased scrutiny from US regulators over antitrust concerns and that it had too much control over the social media space.

Coronavirus: Film piracy streaming trebles in lockdown,"Newly released films have been downloaded illegally in huge numbers since stay-at-home lockdown measures were imposed in the UK.According to Fact, the UK's intellectual property protection organisation, overall links to illegal streaming sites doubled between February and April.And for some recently released films, it had trebled.Kieron Sharp, chief executive of Fact, said it was no surprise.""It's essential to remember that the only legal way of watching films is through the official providers.""Every pirated link that we detect denies the rights holder of revenue they are entitled to, and also threatens investment in future content.""Fact did not name the films that had seen particular spikes in streaming but did encourage people to report illegal sources they come across to Crimestoppers.Its findings are reflected in other studies.Piracy-tracking firm Muso found traffic to illegal streaming and download sites rose by nearly 60% during March. It noted more than 300 million visits to piracy sites in the UK, and more than one billion in the US.Oscar-winning film Parasite saw demand rise 240% on illegal streaming sites at the start of the pandemic. The 2011 film, Contagion, about a virus outbreak, saw a rise in piracy streaming visits of 151%.",15 May 2020,technology
Disney forces explicit Club Penguin clones offline,"Disney has ordered unauthorised copies of its Club Penguin game to close, after the BBC found children were being exposed to explicit messages. Visits to fan-run Club Penguin Online surged during the coronavirus pandemic with more than a million new players. But racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and sexual messages flow freely on the unauthorised platform.Disney said it was ""appalled"" by the website, and has ordered it to close or face legal action.Club Penguin Online appeared to go offline on Friday afternoon.One man involved in the site has been arrested on suspicion of possessing child abuse images.Detectives say the man from London has been released on bail pending further inquiries.Disney's Club Penguin was one of the first social networks for children. Launched in 2005, it had more than 200 million players at its peak.While anybody could join the original website, content filters and human moderators were employed to stop inappropriate messages or personal information from being shared.But Disney closed the website in 2017. Since then, unofficial clones of the website have been operated by fans. These private servers were launched using stolen or copied source code, and can easily be found by children searching the internet. Club Penguin Online is the largest of the social network's unofficial clones. It says its popularity has exploded during the coronavirus pandemic and now has seven million registered players.The BBC set up an account on the English, Spanish and Portuguese versions of Club Penguin Online. It found:Disney's original game banned the sharing of personal details, but players on this cloned site are openly sharing Snapchat, Instagram and Discord account details. A Zoom ""meet-up"" was also advertised and codes and passwords shared openly. Although it is impossible to verify the age of users, many told the BBC they were teenagers, and there were children playing, too.Kaden, 14, told the BBC there were areas of the game where it was safe to operate - but most players were in the unprotected ""mature"" sections. He said the conversations he had seen made him extremely uncomfortable.""Any kid can click on these mature sections and they just see all this inappropriate stuff,"" he said.""I've seen people advertise strip club igloos, I've seen people ask for pimps. There's a lot of swearing on there and I've been asked a lot of crazy things. It's really put me off going on these mature servers.""Kaden's dad, Rick, told the BBC he had no idea what was happening in the game. ""I'm shocked. I thought that if he's on Club Penguin, then he's in a pretty safe place.""Another long-time Club Penguin fan, teenager Miranda, said the game had ""gone from being family-friendly and fun to being monstrous"".Club Penguin Online is the largest private server and uses Disney's branding.One former staff member told the BBC the project had made about £9,000 through adverts, while most of the staff were young unpaid volunteers.Competition between Club Penguin Online and other unofficial versions of the game had escalated in the past six months. Server owners accused one another of hacking and harassment. One said it was a toxic community, ""like Game of Thrones with penguins"".The Club Penguin Online volunteer claims he was encouraged to carry out attacks on rival servers when he was a minor.""I would find out and publish [users'] personal details, like addresses, what they looked like, their family's information. I carried out DDoS (distributed denial of service attacks) on other users, and I would threaten people. The stuff that I did was similar to what happened to me, which affected my whole family, but I do feel really bad about it now.""A current Club Penguin Online staff member denied that this sort of activity was encouraged.Some gamers think the toxic culture on some of these fan servers is a wider problem that needs addressing.Gaming YouTuber Simi Adeshina, known online as Tamago2474, said: ""These private server games are being run by people who aren't really in a position or qualified to do so. It's all good and well to have a community that you've built, but when you get to a certain size there's a point where you have to have to employ a degree of professionalism.""Disney has issued copyright notices to all private server games, giving them a deadline to close down or face legal action.In statement, it said said: ""Child safety is a top priority for the Walt Disney Company and we are appalled by the allegations of criminal activity and abhorrent behaviour on this unauthorised website that is illegally using the Club Penguin brand and characters for its own purposes. ""We continue to enforce our rights against this, and other, unauthorised uses of the Club Penguin game.""",15 May 2020,technology
Google spotlights more suspected Oculus VR gadget-scam ads,"Fresh evidence that scam stores are exploiting Google's Shopping service to appear at the top of its search results has been discovered by the BBC.Two sites offering hard-to-find gadgets at a discount were found to be using bogus checkout facilities that encourage customers to pay via a direct bank transfer.This prevents users from recovering funds if they have second thoughts. Police investigators have expressed frustration about Google's role.One officer who spent years investigating online crime told the BBC that the tech firm could introduce checks to better deter fraudsters, if it made this a priority.Google believes the sites were indeed engaged in fraudulent behaviour and told the BBC it had removed the ads involved. It said it would now make unspecified changes to its automated and human-based review processes.""Our priority is to protect our users, and we continue to update our enforcement policies and technologies to target fraudulent and bad actors,"" a spokeswoman said.""In 2019, our team took down approximately 2.7 billion bad ads.""Both Techziox.com and Shopzeal.co.uk went offline after the BBC contacted them. They did not respond to requests for comment.The sites had earlier run ads for Oculus virtual-reality headsets, which are sold out or priced at a premium on most other sites. The two stores claimed to have the products in stock and priced them at 15-23% below the norm.In some cases, the ads took up most of the screen when viewed on a smartphone, increasing their chance of being clicked.This mirrored the tactics of an earlier suspected scam site - MyTechDomestic - which also placed ads for Oculus headsets and was flagged to Google earlier this week.But while MyTechDomestic only presented shoppers a way to pay by bank transfer, Techziox and Shopzeal both appear to provide an option to use a credit card.If selected, the tool asks for the card's details including its CVV security code, and displays a ""Powered by Stripe"" logo - referring to a California-based internet payment processor.However, Stripe told the BBC that the box was not linked to its system and it did not handle payments for the sites. An independent security researcher, who tracks scam sites, confirmed that the sites' code indicated the card details were instead sent to the stores' operators.In any case, when users tried to use the service, it brought up an error message saying: ""Unfortunately, this payment method is not possible for new customers. Please choose another payment method.""The only other choice was bank transfer, and both Techziox and Shopzeal presented details of the same account at a Swindon-based bank.This is a common tactic used by scam sites to obtain funds. In previous cases, the police have said scammers use personal accounts belonging to individuals who are either complicit or have been coerced into sharing their bank details, and the money is typically withdrawn straight away over the counter or via cash machines.The two sites were both built using Wordpress's web-publishing software, looked similar and listed the same team members alongside email addresses that did not work.However, they gave different residential addresses as their respective headquarters - one in Southampton the other in Huddersfield - and used different domain registrars.They also provided different VAT numbers. In both cases, HM Revenue and Customs said the details were invalid.Techziox appears to have been in operation for longer, and had been accused of being ""straight-up scammers"" by users of Trustpilot's review site.One customer, Nicky Jones, told the BBC her 15-year-old daughter attempted to buy an Oculus Quest after saving for a long time and doing jobs to earn the cash.""My daughter searched online and this company came up, so we purchased the item. I sent emails to the company and I had no emails back,"" she said.""The most upsetting thing is we have lost £329. I would never take this money from my daughter, so I have lost the money. [It's] upsetting how people can do this and get away with this. It's wrong.""According to Whois records, Techziox's site was set up using a Netherlands-based registrar on 18 April, while Shopzeal used a US-based registrar on 7 May.A security blogger who anonymously tracks electronics goods scams said: ""It's horrendous. This is the first time I've seen them use Google Shopping. Previously it was just Adwords.""Google Shopping lets advertisers use images as well as words and is typically more prominent, he noted.Scam sites can be ""difficult to identify,"" he added. ""But maybe Google shouldn't allow a website that's been registered in the last two months to be one of its Shopping results, if it wants to provide a trustworthy customer experience.""",15 May 2020,technology
Facebook to build internet cable 'circumference of Earth',"Facebook is teaming up with telecoms companies to build a 37,000km (23,000-mile) undersea cable to supply faster internet to 16 countries in Africa.Its length - almost equal to the circumference of the Earth - will make it one of the longest, it said.It is part of a long-running bid by Facebook to take its social media platform to Africa's young population.Ready for use by 2024, it will deliver three times the capacity of all current undersea cables serving Africa.""When completed, this new route will deliver much-needed internet capacity, redundancy, and reliability across Africa, supplement a rapidly increasing demand for capacity in the Middle East, and support further growth of 4G, 5G, and broadband access for hundreds of millions of people,"" said Facebook in a blog.Africa lags behind the rest of the world when it comes to internet access, with four in 10 people across the continent having access to the web, compared with a global average of six in 10.But the continent represents huge opportunities for technology firms and businesses with its population of 1.3 billion.The cost of the 2Africa project - which will connect Europe and the Middle East to the continent - has not been disclosed but Bloomberg reported it could be close to $1bn (£820m).Sub-sea cables carry the vast majority of the world's inter-continental data. They can handle much more data and offer faster transmission at a lower cost compared with other methods. The cable - which will be built by Nokia Oyj's Alcatel Submarine Networks - will run along the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea.It will be buried deeper than previous systems for greater protection against external damage from things such as ships' anchors.The fibre-optic cables will have double the capacity of older ones, making use of Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM1) technology.Facebook is teaming up with Johannesburg-based MTN Group, Telecom Egypt, Vodafone and Orange SA.Vodafone said it would pave the way for developing digital businesses on the continent.""We need to ensure that there is enough internet capacity to not only get people online, but to help build a modern digital society that includes services that require a large amount of data transfer, such as cloud computing or video,"" said Nick Gliddon, director of Vodafone Carrier Services.As well as helping businesses, it will also improve healthcare and education, he added.",15 May 2020,technology
