PlayStation 5: Sony to give gamers first look at new platform,"Sony will give gamers their first look at the PlayStation 5 during a special event later on Thursday.Fans will finally get to see a range of yet-to-be-announced titles that are currently in development for the highly anticipated platform. The showcase is one in a series of updates to the console that Sony is set to reveal over the coming months. The Japanese firm will stream the event live at 21:00 BST on YouTube and Twitch.The event was initially set to go ahead on 4 June, but Sony postponed due to the on-going Black Lives Matter protests across the US.All of the new video games showcased at the event will be played on a 4K TV to give a fully-rounded picture of the console's graphic capabilities. Gamers will also be hoping to see the console's custom Solid State Drive (SSD) in action. Sony is hoping it will make loading screens a thing of the past, allowing for large-scale open-world games with little to no barriers. ""We can reasonably expect to see first-party software in action from real PS5 hardware,"" Mark Reed, managing director at Heaven Media told the BBC.   ""Days of pre-rendered footage and trailers are coming to an end and Sony knows that gamers expect to see real games on real hardware,"" he added. However, the system itself is expected to remain under wraps until a later date.   Sony has sold more than 108 million PS4 units around the world since its launch in November 2013, according to data from Ampere Analysis.Microsoft's Xbox One, which launched during the same period, has sold 49 million units to date.Timi Ofarn, co-head of gaming platform The Nerd Council, told the BBC that PS5's price point would probably play a key role in determining if Sony could maintain its position as market leader. ""If they repeat past mistakes such as the ones they made with the PS3 at launch, we’ll definitely observe a swing in consumer buying,"" suggested Mr Ofarn. The PS3 hit the market in 2006 at a substantially higher price point than any of its rivals, and had a slower start than expected as a result. ""In the end, however, I believe it will come down to the games Sony are offering at launch as to whether we’ll see a shift in Sony outselling Microsoft,"" he added. So far very little is known about PlayStation 5, other than Sony confirming it will be released around Christmas. There are increasing concerns about the availability of stock due to the Covid-19 pandemic slowing down production around the world. ""Demand will be very high indeed for the new hardware,"" said Mr Reed. ""Stock may be an issue, but both companies have committed to launching this year.""The chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment, Jim Ryan, claimed earlier this month that the PS5 would represent ""the best in the industry"".He said: ""Studios, both larger and smaller, those newer and those more established, all have been hard at work developing games that will showcase the potential of the hardware.""",11 June 2020,technology

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare fix causes Xbox owners more headaches,"The makers of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare say they have ""resolved"" a problem that caused updates to the video game to be more than twice the size they should have been.But several players who have tried to take advantage of the fix have reported being worse off as a consequence.The initial issue led some Xboxes to start downloading an 85 gigabyte file that should have been about 40GB.And some who cancelled this to try again have lost their main game file.As a consequence they have had to download the entire title from scratch, entailing a download of more than 100GB.In theory it should take about four hours to download a file of that size on an average UK home broadband connection.In practice, however, it takes much longer, because the data cannot be downloaded at the maximum speed if there are too many people trying to do so at once.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's Season 4 update introduces new weapons, narrative video scenes, maps and bug fixes to Activision's first-person shooter.Once downloaded, it takes up only 4GB more storage than the previous version on the hard drive. Even so, some players have expressed concern at the amount of disc space they are having to give up - as the game has had one of the largest file sizes among mainstream games since its release last year.On Sony's PlayStation 4, the installed game can now take up close to 200GB in total - about half disc space available on the basic version. Owners can, however, delete some of the modes they do not play to free up storage for other games and media.The update was originally scheduled to have been made available on 3 June but developer Infinity Ward said it had been held back until now to allow people to focus on voices calling for ""equality, justice and change"" as part of the US protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd.Activision said the latest version of Modern Warfare had been its bestselling Call of Duty game to date, during a recent analysts briefing. The company makes money from each season update as players can pay a fee to unlock new content rather than having to spend hours earning it via a series of in-game achievements.",11 June 2020,technology
PimEyes facial recognition website 'could be used by stalkers',"A free facial recognition tool that allows people to find pictures of themselves or others from around the internet has drawn criticism from privacy campaigners.PimEyes describes itself as a privacy tool to help prevent misuse of images.But Big Brother Watch said it could ""enable state surveillance, commercial monitoring and even stalking on a scale previously unimaginable"".It comes as Amazon decides to pause its use of facial recognition for a year.Polish website PimEyes was set up in 2017 as a hobby project, and commercialised last year. It currently has 6,000 users signed up.Attention was drawn to it following an article published on Medium.The website allows people to upload any picture for free and it will then find matching images from around the web, drawing on publicly accessible sites such as Tumblr, news outlets and blogs.Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, told the BBC: ""To see this powerful surveillance tech marketed to individuals is chilling. It's ripe for stalking and puts women and children at unprecedented risk.""In response, PimEyes said: ""Our privacy policy prevents people from using our tool for this case. Every tool could be used in the wrong way.""It told the BBC that it categorically did not use images scraped from social media, despite the BBC finding pictures of its reporters that had been uploaded to Facebook and Twitter.""If you found faces which were posted only on Facebook that means that someone else has posted it somewhere else. We crawl only websites that agree in their rules for crawling,"" it said in an email.Using social media images has got facial recognition firm ClearviewAI into trouble. It amassed more than three billion photographs from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which are used by the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and 600 other law enforcement agencies around the world to identify suspects.All three social networks have asked it  to stop doing so. PimEyes offers a premium service that allows people to input up to 25 images of different people and get alerts whenever new photos are uploaded online. Currently it has 350 active users of this service.It told the BBC that the premise of the website was to help individuals ""fight for their own online privacy"", including finding fake profiles, leaked images and unauthorised photo usage.It acknowledged that it did work with police forces, feeding into Paliscope, a software tool used by law enforcement agents.But it has removed a reference on its website about searching the dark web for the police.According to PimEye's website, images uploaded to the site are ""never saved or indexed"". Instead it says it uses a fingerprint of a face - the main features - which is encoded and temporarily saved on its servers.Facial recognition technology has become increasingly controversial as more police forces around the world adopt the tools.

Coronavirus: Ministers consider NHS contact-tracing app rethink,"Concerns about the risks of deploying a go-it-alone UK coronavirus contact-tracing app are causing further delays.A second version of the smartphone software was due to have begun testing on the Isle of Wight on Tuesday, but the government decided to postpone the trial.Ministers are considering switching the app over to tech developed by Apple and Google.But countries testing that model are experiencing issues of their own.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said the NHS Covid-19 app was to be launched across England - and possibly other parts of the UK - by 1 June.But he subsequently said the government had decided it would be better to establish a network of human contact tracers first.However, the BBC has discovered that one of the main reasons the initiative is running behind schedule is that developers are having problems using Bluetooth as a means to estimate distance.Even so, they still believe they are better placed to tackle the challenge than counterparts overseas who are working under constraints imposed by the two US tech firms.Contact-tracing apps are designed to prevent a second wave of infections by keeping a log of when two people are in close proximity to each other and for how long.If one of the users later tests positive for the disease, the records are used to determine how likely it is they infected the other. If required, an alert is triggered to help prevent the further spread of the virus.The UK has adopted what is known as a ""centralised"" approach, meaning that the contact-matching process is carried out on a remote computer server. One benefit is it offers epidemiologists more data to tackle the pandemic. France and India are other countries to have adopted this model.By contrast, Apple and Google's ""decentralised"" approach carries out the matches on the handsets themselves, on the grounds this better protects users' privacy.Poland switched its app from a centralised to decentralised approach on Tuesday. Switzerland, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Latvia are among others to have adopted the tech giants' design.Both systems rely on Bluetooth ""handshakes"" to work.Number 10 is concerned that iPhones will not always detect each other because of a restriction Apple has imposed on apps that do not adopt its model.But the UK team has devised a workaround and is more concerned about other limitations of using Bluetooth.Some of these issues were outlined in a study published by Trinity College Dublin last month.It highlighted problems with using received Bluetooth signal strength as a means to estimate distance.Researchers warned signal strength ""can vary substantially"" depending on:The report highlighted troubling results when Singapore's TraceTogether app was tested.An experiment within a stationary train carriage found that when users moved from a distance of 3.5m (11.5ft) to 4m, signals became stronger rather than weaker because of the way metal objects were reflecting the radio waves. A trial in a supermarket also found the received signal strength was the same whether two people were walking close together or 2m apart.Follow-up tests using Apple-Google's tech are currently under way.""The work is ongoing, but preliminary results are broadly consistent with previous observations,"" said Dr Brendan Jennings, who has been tasked with assessing the effectiveness of Ireland's Covid-19 app.The team behind Switzerland's SwissCovid app is carrying out tests of its own.Its Bluetooth measurement chief believes the issue can be partly addressed by taking a range of readings over a period of five minutes or more.But he added that Apple and Google had placed curbs on what could be achieved.""The Google and Apple API [application programming interface] limits the amount of raw information that is actually exposed to the app,"" Prof Mathias Payer told the BBC.""For maximum utility, we would get all the different measurements, but this has privacy implications.""Apps using Google and Apple's tech do not get to see the actual signal strength but rather one of three values, based on calculations used to normalise the different ways Bluetooth behaves on different handsets,By contrast, the UK team can currently obtain the measurements directly. Those responsible believe a further advantage of their centralised approach is that the data can be processed on the server involved, since it would be too taxing a task to be done on smartphones.But part of their challenge is communicating this to Baroness Dido Harding -  who heads up the wider Test and Trace programme - and 10 Downing Street itself.A spokesman for the prime minister declined to comment.",11 June 2020,technology
Developer warns VR headset damaged eyesight,"A software developer has tweeted about how wearing a VR headset for hours a day has damaged his eyesight.A visit to the opticians left him ""worried about my future VR use"" after a doctor blamed the technology for a problem with his vision.Glasses should correct the issue but would normally only ""be prescribed to 40-year-olds"", he tweeted.The Association of Optometrists said it had not seen evidence that VR headsets could cause permanent eye damage.Facebook-owned Oculus states in its handbook that one in 4,000 may suffer ""dizziness, seizures, eye or muscle twitching."" It recommends users suffering these symptoms discontinue using the headset and see a doctor.Doctors have previously warned that virtual reality, which is the computer-generated simulation of a real or imaginary environment, can cause eye strain because the brain is forced to process visual stimuli in a different way to normal.And users have complained about nausea and dizziness when using headsets, which is generally put down the the way a user perceives space around them, leading to motion sickness.Danny Bittman, who has worked as a virtual reality developer for four years, suggested it could have affected his eyesight.""Just had my first eye doctor visit in three years. Now I'm very worried about my future VR use. I have a new eye convergence problem that acts like dyslexia. The doc, a headset owner, is convinced my VR use caused this. He said ""these glasses we usually prescribe to 40-year-olds"", he tweeted.He went on to describe the problem: ""My eyes jump when I read things like a screen or books. I've always had a small level of this but it's greatly intensified now. It's also linked to headaches and vertigo.""He said that the issue was about ""prolonged use"", and admitted that he could spend up to six hours a day wearing a headset, split into 30-minute sessions.Ceri Smith-Jaynes, from the Association of Optometrists, told the BBC: ""We currently do not have any reliable evidence that VR headsets cause permanent deterioration in eyesight in children or adults. There have been some studies looking into the effects of short-term use of VR headsets only; these did not reveal a deterioration in eyesight. ""However, some people do suffer from temporary symptoms such as nausea, dry, irritable eyes, headache or eyestrain. ""But she did have some advice about usage: ""If you spend all day in VR without a break, you'll need time to readjust to the light and the different visual environment of the real world. I would suggest taking a five-to-ten minute break each hour, using that time to move about, blink and look out of a window, or take a short walk. ""The number of hours of headset use a person can comfortably tolerate will vary depending on your binocular vision status (ask your optometrist) and the task you are doing in VR.""VR headsets have been adapted to help improve eyesight. Start-up GiveVision created a device called SightPlus, that aims to restore vision to people whose eyesight has deteriorated beyond repair by projecting a video of the real world into the working part of the retina.A clinical trial at Moorfields Eye Hospital suggested it improved eyesight in 59 of the 60 participants, with nearly half saying they would wear the device for watching TV, reading or going to the theatre. The firm is partnering with Sony to develop its next device.",10 June 2020,technology

Developer warns VR headset damaged eyesight,"A software developer has tweeted about how wearing a VR headset for hours a day has damaged his eyesight.A visit to the opticians left him ""worried about my future VR use"" after a doctor blamed the technology for a problem with his vision.Glasses should correct the issue but would normally only ""be prescribed to 40-year-olds"", he tweeted.The Association of Optometrists said it had not seen evidence that VR headsets could cause permanent eye damage.Facebook-owned Oculus states in its handbook that one in 4,000 may suffer ""dizziness, seizures, eye or muscle twitching."" It recommends users suffering these symptoms discontinue using the headset and see a doctor.Doctors have previously warned that virtual reality, which is the computer-generated simulation of a real or imaginary environment, can cause eye strain because the brain is forced to process visual stimuli in a different way to normal.And users have complained about nausea and dizziness when using headsets, which is generally put down the the way a user perceives space around them, leading to motion sickness.Danny Bittman, who has worked as a virtual reality developer for four years, suggested it could have affected his eyesight.""Just had my first eye doctor visit in three years. Now I'm very worried about my future VR use. I have a new eye convergence problem that acts like dyslexia. The doc, a headset owner, is convinced my VR use caused this.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare fix causes Xbox owners more headaches,"The makers of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare say they have ""resolved"" a problem that caused updates to the video game to be more than twice the size they should have been.But several players who have tried to take advantage of the fix have reported being worse off as a consequence.The initial issue led some Xboxes to start downloading an 85 gigabyte file that should have been about 40GB.And some who cancelled this to try again have lost their main game file.As a consequence they have had to download the entire title from scratch, entailing a download of more than 100GB.In theory it should take about four hours to download a file of that size on an average UK home broadband connection.In practice, however, it takes much longer, because the data cannot be downloaded at the maximum speed if there are too many people trying to do so at once.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's Season 4 update introduces new weapons, narrative video scenes, maps and bug fixes to Activision's first-person shooter.Once downloaded, it takes up only 4GB more storage than the previous version on the hard drive. Even so, some players have expressed concern at the amount of disc space they are having to give up - as the game has had one of the largest file sizes among mainstream games since its release last year.On Sony's PlayStation 4, the installed game can now take up close to 200GB in total - about half disc space available on the basic version. Owners can, however, delete some of the modes they do not play to free up storage for other games and media.The update was originally scheduled to have been made available on 3 June but developer Infinity Ward said it had been held back until now to allow people to focus on voices calling for ""equality, justice and change"" as part of the US protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd.Activision said the latest version of Modern Warfare had been its bestselling Call of Duty game to date, during a recent analysts briefing. The company makes money from each season update as players can pay a fee to unlock new content rather than having to spend hours earning it via a series of in-game achievements.",11 June 2020,technology
PimEyes facial recognition website 'could be used by stalkers',"A free facial recognition tool that allows people to find pictures of themselves or others from around the internet has drawn criticism from privacy campaigners.PimEyes describes itself as a privacy tool to help prevent misuse of images.But Big Brother Watch said it could ""enable state surveillance, commercial monitoring and even stalking on a scale previously unimaginable"".It comes as Amazon decides to pause its use of facial recognition for a year.Polish website PimEyes was set up in 2017 as a hobby project, and commercialised last year. It currently has 6,000 users signed up.Attention was drawn to it following an article published on Medium.The website allows people to upload any picture for free and it will then find matching images from around the web, drawing on publicly accessible sites such as Tumblr, news outlets and blogs.Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, told the BBC: ""To see this powerful surveillance tech marketed to individuals is chilling. It's ripe for stalking and puts women and children at unprecedented risk.""In response, PimEyes said: ""Our privacy policy prevents people from using our tool for this case. Every tool could be used in the wrong way.""It told the BBC that it categorically did not use images scraped from social media, despite the BBC finding pictures of its reporters that had been uploaded to Facebook and Twitter.""If you found faces which were posted only on Facebook that means that someone else has posted it somewhere else. We crawl only websites that agree in their rules for crawling,"" it said in an email.Using social media images has got facial recognition firm ClearviewAI into trouble. It amassed more than three billion photographs from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which are used by the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and 600 other law enforcement agencies around the world to identify suspects.All three social networks have asked it  to stop doing so. PimEyes offers a premium service that allows people to input up to 25 images of different people and get alerts whenever new photos are uploaded online. Currently it has 350 active users of this service.It told the BBC that the premise of the website was to help individuals ""fight for their own online privacy"", including finding fake profiles, leaked images and unauthorised photo usage.It acknowledged that it did work with police forces, feeding into Paliscope, a software tool used by law enforcement agents.But it has removed a reference on its website about searching the dark web for the police.According to PimEye's website, images uploaded to the site are ""never saved or indexed"". Instead it says it uses a fingerprint of a face - the main features - which is encoded and temporarily saved on its servers.Facial recognition technology has become increasingly controversial as more police forces around the world adopt the tools. Several studies question how accurate the technology is, suggesting that it performs particularly poorly when identifying black people.In the wake of protests over the killing of George Floyd and calls for police reform, IBM and Amazon have both stopped the use of facial recognition technology.In Amazon's case, police use of its Rekognition software has been paused for a year to allow the US government to decide how it wants the technology to be used in future.",11 June 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Ministers consider NHS contact-tracing app rethink,"Concerns about the risks of deploying a go-it-alone UK coronavirus contact-tracing app are causing further delays.A second version of the smartphone software was due to have begun testing on the Isle of Wight on Tuesday, but the government decided to postpone the trial.Ministers are considering switching the app over to tech developed by Apple and Google.But countries testing that model are experiencing issues of their own.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said the NHS Covid-19 app was to be launched across England - and possibly other parts of the UK - by 1 June.But he subsequently said the government had decided it would be better to establish a network of human contact tracers first.However, the BBC has discovered that one of the main reasons the initiative is running behind schedule is that developers are having problems using Bluetooth as a means to estimate distance.Even so, they still believe they are better placed to tackle the challenge than counterparts overseas who are working under constraints imposed by the two US tech firms.Contact-tracing apps are designed to prevent a second wave of infections by keeping a log of when two people are in close proximity to each other and for how long.If one of the users later tests positive for the disease, the records are used to determine how likely it is they infected the other. If required, an alert is triggered to help prevent the further spread of the virus.The UK has adopted what is known as a ""centralised"" approach, meaning that the contact-matching process is carried out on a remote computer server. One benefit is it offers epidemiologists more data to tackle the pandemic. France and India are other countries to have adopted this model.By contrast, Apple and Google's ""decentralised"" approach carries out the matches on the handsets themselves, on the grounds this better protects users' privacy.Poland switched its app from a centralised to decentralised approach on Tuesday.

'How my photo ended up breaking Android phones',"Gaurav Agrawal, a scientist and amateur photographer living in San Diego, couldn't believe it when he suddenly started seeing a photograph he took last summer popping up on the news.He took it at St Mary Lake in Glacier National Park, Montana, one ""magical evening"" in August 2019.He shared the snap on photo platform Flickr and thought no more about it.However, a glitch meant that when the image was set as wallpaper, it caused some Android phones to fail.The handsets would switch on and off repeatedly, requiring a factory reset which meant all data on them was wiped.  Last week, a tweet about the bug went viral - and Mr Agrawal contacted me.""I didn't do anything intentionally,"" he said. ""I'm sad that people ended up having issues."" It seems to happen on some but not all brands of phones running Version 10 of the Android operating system. It is not advisable to test it out.""It was a magical evening,"" Mr Agrawal told the BBC of the night he took the photo, in the park with his wife. It was their third trip there, in pursuit of the perfect picture.""It was gloomy and cloudy, and we thought there wasn't going to be a great sunset. We were about to leave when things started to change.""He grabbed the shot on his Nikon camera, and later did a small edit using the editing software Lightroom.And that's where the bug crept in.Lightroom gives three colour-mode options for exporting the finished result - and the one he picked is the one that seems to confuse some Android handsets. He was unaware of the glitch because he had never tried it.""I didn't know the format would do this,"" he said. ""I have an iPhone, and my wallpaper is always a photo of my wife.""Mr Agrawal has over 10,000 followers on the photography platform Flickr and has had his work published by National Geographic magazine.""I hoped my photograph would have gone 'viral' for a good reason, but maybe that's for another time,"" he said.""I'm going to use another format from now on.""For those who do not know the background, Ken Munro and Dave Lodge from security firm Pen Test partners have an explanation of what went wrong: ""As digital photographs have improved in quality, phones need to check what the image 'colour space' is to work out how to display it properly. ""It's how a phone knows how to display exactly the right shade of green, for example.""There are different ways of defining the colour space. Some spaces have specialist uses in graphic design, so sometimes you'll see images that aren't in the usual 'Standard RGB' format. It's also possible to deliberately create images that have more colour information than some devices can handle. ""What's happened here is that the way some phones deal with these cases has gone wrong. ""The phone crashes because it doesn't know how to deal with it correctly, and the software developers probably hadn't considered this might happen.""",10 June 2020,technology
Coronavirus: How map hacks and buttocks helped Taiwan fight Covid-19,"With direct flights to Wuhan and a population of 24 million people living in densely packed cities, Taiwan's coronavirus outlook seemed grave.But, to date, the disease has claimed just seven lives on the island, and it never went into full lockdown.Its leaders credit masks as playing a key role, but not for the reasons you might suppose.""Masks are something that, first, reminds you to wash your hands properly and, second, protects you from touching your mouth - that is the main benefit to the person who wears it,"" explains Audrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister. Taiwan's citizens have worn face masks for health and other reasons since the 1950s, but the spread of coronavirus prompted a spate of panic-buying.To even out demand, the masks had to be rationed while production was ramped up, from two million to 20 million items a day.Long queues snaked back from pharmacies and other outlets - which posed a risk of contagion in themselves. So, the government decided data about each location's stock levels should be made publicly available.To do so, Ms Tang's ministry launched a platform which each vendor could keep updated with their stock numbers.Then, Taiwan's hacking community, with whom the government had been building a strong relationship for years, stepped in.It began drawing on the data, which had been made public, to build a series of real-time 'mask maps'. These provided residents with up-to-date information on where they could find masks close to their homes or work, with details of how many were available to buy.As the maps grew in popularity, more hacking teams joined in and added features like voice-control for users with visual impairments.More than 10 million people have used the mask apps.The result, says Ms Tang, is that these days only a minority do not wear them, and even they now ""feel social pressure"" to do so.""This is the first time hackers have really felt that they are like the designers of civil engineering projects,"" she adds.""Because we trust the people a lot, sometimes the people trust back.""The relationship between Taiwan's authorities and the general population wasn't always so smooth.There were recriminations following 2003's severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (Sars), when the response was ""very chaotic"", says Ms Tang.Part of the problem was that the government failed to create a centralised body to coordinate its response.Leaders learned the lesson, and in 2004 established the National Health Command Centre to ensure that, in future crises, government agencies would work better together. They also ordered stockpiles of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be kept at a level that would be sufficient to deal with the early stage of any future pandemic.In 2014, there was more civil strife when citizens stormed the parliament building to protest against a trade agreement which many felt brought Taiwan too close to China. Most of all they objected to how they hadn't been listened to by those in power. The event became known as the Sunflower Revolution because protesters used the flower as a symbol of hope.Among their number were a band of civil hackers, who collaborated on programs that used available data to solve challenges facing society. The government subsequently invited them to find ways to crowdsource and analyse citizens' views and insights, to better influence the creation of new laws.Ms Tang - herself a civic hacker at the time - suggests that Taiwan's government was quick to counter the threat of the coronavirus, in part, because past crises had taught it the value of being more responsive.So when a 'netizen' re-posted to Taiwan's equivalent of Reddit a warning from Wuhan of a Sars-like illness, in the early hours at the end of December, people upvoted it - and the authorities paid attention.That message turned out to be from Dr Li Wenliang, the Chinese whistleblower who first alerted the world to Covid-19.Soon after, targeted sections of the population were tested and traced if they had just returned from Wuhan and recently experienced any health issues. It worked - and the virus was stopped in its tracks. There are other reasons why Taiwan has been able to suppress Covid-19.Earlier this week, Chien-Jen Chen - the island's former vice-president and a renowned epidemiologist - told British MPs that a well-designed contact tracing system and the application of strict quarantine rules to inbound visitors had also played a major role.But he too said the nature of the island's ""hyper-democracy"" - and the efforts its health chiefs had made to gain the public's trust - were the key factors in it success.Those in power aren't just responsive to the voices of citizens, but also the memes and other messages they share.It helped the government counter false claims that the material used to make masks was the same as that found in toilet paper. In response Taiwan's Premier posted a self-mocking cartoon, which showed his bottom wiggling, alongside an explanation of the different sources that toilet paper and mask paper come from. ""It went absolutely viral"" says Ms Tang, of the government strategy referred to as ""humour over rumour"". The strategy uses catchy tweet-length posts, which are designed to spread more quickly than misinformation.""The chances are that most people will see... the clarification message before the rumour,"" explains Ms Tang.""Then they will have herd immunity - or, in the case of a meme, nerd immunity,"" she jokes.At a time when trust in the authorities is becoming frayed elsewhere, Ms Tang suggests Taiwan illustrates there is an alternative to a top-down approach, should a second wave of the virus hit.But ""that decision must be made by the entire society"", she adds.",7 June 2020,technology
Xbox Series X: Microsoft tailors launch plans for the pandemic,"The biggest challenge facing Microsoft and Sony's next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - might not be proving the most powerful or having the best games at launch but the fallout from Covid-19.Many gamers will have less spare cash to spend. And there has been speculation supply-chain problems caused by the pandemic will lead to manufacturing delays and higher costs.This was supposed to be the week of the giant E3 games expo, in Los Angeles, a chance to build hype for the launches.Instead, Xbox will give a first look at some games in development via a streamed event in July.In the meantime, Xbox chief Phil Spencer discussed some of the issues on his mind with BBC Click.The interview, below, has been edited for brevity and clarity.How has the pandemic affected your launch plans?Early on, as we were starting to deal with people working from home, there were a lot of questions about what was going to happen with the supply chain and testing our hardware.But when I look at the hardware production now, I feel really good. We have test kits at home and we're all using them, so we can ensure that everything's working the way it should.We're also making good progress with the software platform that we've built to ensure the games run well. And with regards to the supply chain, it looks like builds of the consoles will be uninterrupted.We probably had a couple [of] weeks missing in our testing cycle, just as we got up to speed with things.But I feel like we'll be able to absorb a lot of that into the schedule, and I feel really good about our autumn launch.Do you anticipate any other problems?It looks like we're moving into a period of of massive economic uncertainty.The thing I'm probably focused on the most is the macro-economic environment. We see the impact of people getting furloughed and layoffs. It's tough.And we are a leisure activity. We're not a requirement. We're not food. We're not shelter.So we want to be really tuned in to that as we launch. How can we make it as affordable as possible? How can we give buyers choice? We've got an Xbox All Access subscription programme that allows people to buy their next console by paying a monthly charge.And if now is not the time for you to buy a new console, and you're going to stay with the console you have, we're going to keep supporting that console.And through technologies like smart delivery, you can buy your games and know that when you buy the next console, your games will move with you, to allow consumers to make the choice that's right for them.Won't gamers take into account the console will be at its most expensive at launch?People find real value in the investment that they make in gaming. You can buy a console, buy some games, and it can literally provide your family with hundreds of hours of entertainment.Even when we went back and looked at 2008-09, in that recession, to see what the impact was on gaming - gaming did OK. It was durable.We want to make sure we're providing the right value to customers.Price is going to be important.But our strategy is centred around the player, not the device.If this is not the year when a family wants to make a decision to buy a new Xbox, that's OK. Our strategy does not revolve around how many Xboxes I sell this year.We're focused on delivering services through Xbox Game Pass, which allows people to build their library for a monthly fee. Backward compatibility means that the console that they have will play thousands and thousands of games. Smart delivery means when they move to the next generation, the games will move with them. In the past, there's been an obsession about how many units are sold in the opening weeks and months of a new console's life. Given the pandemic, do you think that won't be the best way to measure the success of the launch this time?I think you already see that from a lot of the platform-holders, who are starting to pivot to engagement metrics than device metrics:We've seen our subscribers play 40% more games than others, which we just think is great in terms of people finding a diversity of content.The cycle in games is a little different than some of the other media out there. Games are very durable, they're played over time, so it's not just about what happened today. One of our biggest games is Minecraft, and it just crossed over 200 million players. We just had one of our biggest months ever in terms of Minecraft usage.The game is 10 years old. You don't really see that in many other forms of media.So for us, it's about engagement with large player bases, giving them a great place to go play, find friends and find new games.Many people around the world have had to self-isolate during lockdowns. What role have games played in making them feel less isolated and more socially connected?The nice thing about gaming is it has always been a social activity.In fact, during this lockdown time, we've had over 270 million new friend relationships created on Xbox Live.So not only are people staying connected with their existing friends, they're finding new friends online as they're playing together, which is really great.Lot's of creative industries have had to shut down during the pandemic. But work on video games continues doesn't it?Yeah, it's been a mix. There's certain parts of the creative process in building a game that can happen remotely. But there are certain functions in game production that still require people to be closer together.Today's big triple-A blockbuster games involve hundreds of people coming together to build games.And we have seen a pause in some things, like motion-capture of actors and some symphonic work involving musicians, where people need to be close.But we're still launching games.The teams continue to work and find new ways to work together.",8 June 2020,technology
