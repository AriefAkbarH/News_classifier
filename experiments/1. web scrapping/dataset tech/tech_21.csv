Xbox Series X: Microsoft tailors launch plans for the pandemic,"The biggest challenge facing Microsoft and Sony's next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - might not be proving the most powerful or having the best games at launch but the fallout from Covid-19.Many gamers will have less spare cash to spend. And there has been speculation supply-chain problems caused by the pandemic will lead to manufacturing delays and higher costs.This was supposed to be the week of the giant E3 games expo, in Los Angeles, a chance to build hype for the launches.Instead, Xbox will give a first look at some games in development via a streamed event in July.In the meantime, Xbox chief Phil Spencer discussed some of the issues on his mind with BBC Click.The interview, below, has been edited for brevity and clarity.How has the pandemic affected your launch plans?Early on, as we were starting to deal with people working from home, there were a lot of questions about what was going to happen with the supply chain and testing our hardware.But when I look at the hardware production now, I feel really good. We have test kits at home and we're all using them, so we can ensure that everything's working the way it should.We're also making good progress with the software platform that we've built to ensure the games run well. And with regards to the supply chain, it looks like builds of the consoles will be uninterrupted.We probably had a couple [of] weeks missing in our testing cycle, just as we got up to speed with things.But I feel like we'll be able to absorb a lot of that into the schedule, and I feel really good about our autumn launch.Do you anticipate any other problems?It looks like we're moving into a period of of massive economic uncertainty.The thing I'm probably focused on the most is the macro-economic environment. We see the impact of people getting furloughed and layoffs. It's tough.And we are a leisure activity. We're not a requirement. We're not food. We're not shelter.So we want to be really tuned in to that as we launch. How can we make it as affordable as possible? How can we give buyers choice? We've got an Xbox All Access subscription programme that allows people to buy their next console by paying a monthly charge.And if now is not the time for you to buy a new console, and you're going to stay with the console you have, we're going to keep supporting that console.And through technologies like smart delivery, you can buy your games and know that when you buy the next console, your games will move with you, to allow consumers to make the choice that's right for them.Won't gamers take into account the console will be at its most expensive at launch?People find real value in the investment that they make in gaming. You can buy a console, buy some games, and it can literally provide your family with hundreds of hours of entertainment.Even when we went back and looked at 2008-09, in that recession, to see what the impact was on gaming - gaming did OK. It was durable.We want to make sure we're providing the right value to customers.Price is going to be important.But our strategy is centred around the player, not the device.If this is not the year when a family wants to make a decision to buy a new Xbox, that's OK. Our strategy does not revolve around how many Xboxes I sell this year.We're focused on delivering services through Xbox Game Pass, which allows people to build their library for a monthly fee. Backward compatibility means that the console that they have will play thousands and thousands of games. Smart delivery means when they move to the next generation, the games will move with them. In the past, there's been an obsession about how many units are sold in the opening weeks and months of a new console's life. Given the pandemic, do you think that won't be the best way to measure the success of the launch this time?I think you already see that from a lot of the platform-holders, who are starting to pivot to engagement metrics than device metrics:We've seen our subscribers play 40% more games than others, which we just think is great in terms of people finding a diversity of content.The cycle in games is a little different than some of the other media out there. Games are very durable, they're played over time, so it's not just about what happened today. One of our biggest games is Minecraft, and it just crossed over 200 million players. We just had one of our biggest months ever in terms of Minecraft usage.The game is 10 years old. You don't really see that in many other forms of media.So for us, it's about engagement with large player bases, giving them a great place to go play, find friends and find new games.Many people around the world have had to self-isolate during lockdowns. What role have games played in making them feel less isolated and more socially connected?The nice thing about gaming is it has always been a social activity.In fact, during this lockdown time, we've had over 270 million new friend relationships created on Xbox Live.So not only are people staying connected with their existing friends, they're finding new friends online as they're playing together, which is really great.Lot's of creative industries have had to shut down during the pandemic. But work on video games continues doesn't it?Yeah, it's been a mix. There's certain parts of the creative process in building a game that can happen remotely. But there are certain functions in game production that still require people to be closer together.Today's big triple-A blockbuster games involve hundreds of people coming together to build games.And we have seen a pause in some things, like motion-capture of actors and some symphonic work involving musicians, where people need to be close.But we're still launching games.The teams continue to work and find new ways to work together.",8 June 2020,technology
Tesla battery supplier Catl says new design has one million-mile lifespan,"A Chinese car battery-maker says it is ready to manufacture a product capable of powering a vehicle for 1.2 million miles (two million kilometres) across the course of a 16-year lifespan.By contrast, most automakers only offer warranties ranging from 60,000 to 150,000 miles over a three to eight-year period on their cars' batteries.Contemporary Amperex Technology has not revealed who it intends to supply.But it was previously reported that the battery was co-developed with Tesla.The latest news was revealed in an interview Catl's chairman gave to the Bloomberg news agency.""If someone places an order, we are ready to produce,"" it quoted Zeng Yuqun as saying.He added that it was set, however, to cost a 10% premium over the batteries it already supplies.The company signed a two-year deal to supply batteries for Tesla's Model 3 cars in February. Its other clients include BMW, Daimler, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.Demand for electric vehicles is growing.The European market for EVs and plug-in hybrids grew by 72% in the first three months of the year compared to the same period in 2019, representing 7% of all delivered new cars, according to research firm Canalys.By contrast, the pandemic weighed on the wider market, which as a whole saw deliveries down by 26% for the quarter.The firm said that Catl's claim was ""significant but difficult to verify"".""It is likely to be used as a differentiator by some car-makers when there is a significant difference from one vehicle to another - dramatically affecting resale value,"" said Canalys's chief automotive analyst Chris Jones.He added that this and other factors - including the wider availability of charging points and longer driving ranges - should help tempt more motorists to make the switch to an electric car.In February, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC that the UK might ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars as soon as 2032, to help meet the UK's zero-carbon emission targets.The Sunday Telegraph reported yesterday that the government is considering offering drivers up to £6,000 to swap their existing cars for electric models next month as part of efforts to boost the UK's electric car manufacturing industry.The Nissan Leaf and Mini Electric are made locally, and Property Week has reported that Tesla is also considering opening its own ""gigafactory"" car battery plant in England.However, Catl's own European efforts are currently focused on Germany, where it is building a factory in the eastern town of Erfurt, which is scheduled to start producing lithium-ion car batteries in 2021.",8 June 2020,technology
Huawei launches media blitz as UK weighs its role in 5G networks,"Huawei is launching a newspaper and internet campaign to mark 20 years of business in the UK.In an open letter to the public, the Chinese telecoms company says it is ""as committed as ever"" to provide ""the best equipment"" to the UK's 5G mobile and full-fibre broadband providers.It comes amid a new security review that could lead the UK government to ban use of Huawei's 5G network kit.Huawei's local boss said he expects the UK to act in the nation's interests.The initiative follows a report in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, which said London-headquartered bank HSBC fears it could face reprisals in China, if the UK acts against Huawei.The Sunday Times also reported that China's ambassador to the UK had recently told business leaders that Beijing viewed the matter as ""a litmus test of whether Britain is a true and faithful partner"". Victor Zhang, vice president of Huawei and head of its UK operations, told the BBC the advertising campaign was about giving people the facts amid all the ""noise"" surrounding the company.He said he hoped the UK would take an ""evidence and fact-based approach"" and warned of huge economic impact if greater connectivity was delayed by the company's exclusion, potentially running into the tens of billions of pounds of lost productivity benefits. ""We need to work closely to address the issue, but we need to take action to accelerate the broadband deployment,"" he said. ""We don't have time to delay this.""Huawei's first significant global breakthrough came in the UK in 2005, when it signed a deal to upgrade BT's copper broadband service, five years after having entered the market.And 15 years later, the UK government's decision to allow Huawei a role in the country's 5G mobile networks represented another crucial victory.In January, ministers announced that Huawei's market share would be capped at 35%, and it would be excluded from sensitive locations, as well as the so-called ""core"" of the network, which is likened to the brains of the system.It appeared that the Chinese tech giant had avoided the outright ban that the US had been pressing for, on the grounds that the firm poses a national security risk.But a backbench rebellion by Conservative MPs in March and then the coronavirus crisis have heightened political pressure for the UK to be less dependent on China.And Washington's campaign has also not relented since January's decision, despite Huawei's repeated denials that it would ever compromise its clients. In May, the US placed significant new sanctions on the company, which limits its access to American computer chip technology. ""We think this decision will heavily impact on the global supply chain of the semiconductor industry,"" Mr Zhang told the BBC. ""We need to work out a solution.""Mr Zhang said that it was still too early for the company to draw any conclusion about the impact, and promised to share details of its own review when complete. However, the sanctions prompted the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to carry out its own review. NCSC is expected to report in the coming weeks, and may say it has lost confidence it can manage the risks associated with Huawei being involved in 5G.That could open the way for the government to shift its position to further reducing, or even eventually eliminating Huawei's role. That could be costly to mobile operators, leading to higher bills for customers. It could also mean their rollout of 5G in the UK is slower.The advertising campaign also highlights Huawei's support of British universities and other institutions, which might also be affected, were the company to be blocked.""We believe the UK will definitely review this based on the facts and the evidence, because the UK will take its own interests very seriously,"" Mr Zhang said. The founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei was reported by the Wall Street Journal on Saturday to have told staff in 2018 that the company was in a battle with the US and they should ""surge forward, killing as you go, to blaze us a trail of blood"". Asked about the language, Mr Zhang said it reflected a sense that Huawei was under intense attack from the United States. ""We are very vulnerable and we know America tried to attack Huawei with so called security reasons which are actually totally wrong,"" he said.""It is simply because of trade and protectionism.""

Coronavirus: How map hacks and buttocks helped Taiwan fight Covid-19,"With direct flights to Wuhan and a population of 24 million people living in densely packed cities, Taiwan's coronavirus outlook seemed grave.But, to date, the disease has claimed just seven lives on the island, and it never went into full lockdown.Its leaders credit masks as playing a key role, but not for the reasons you might suppose.""Masks are something that, first, reminds you to wash your hands properly and, second, protects you from touching your mouth - that is the main benefit to the person who wears it,"" explains Audrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister. Taiwan's citizens have worn face masks for health and other reasons since the 1950s, but the spread of coronavirus prompted a spate of panic-buying.To even out demand, the masks had to be rationed while production was ramped up, from two million to 20 million items a day.Long queues snaked back from pharmacies and other outlets - which posed a risk of contagion in themselves. So, the government decided data about each location's stock levels should be made publicly available.To do so, Ms Tang's ministry launched a platform which each vendor could keep updated with their stock numbers.Then, Taiwan's hacking community, with whom the government had been building a strong relationship for years, stepped in.It began drawing on the data, which had been made public, to build a series of real-time 'mask maps'. These provided residents with up-to-date information on where they could find masks close to their homes or work, with details of how many were available to buy.As the maps grew in popularity, more hacking teams joined in and added features like voice-control for users with visual impairments.More than 10 million people have used the mask apps.The result, says Ms Tang, is that these days only a minority do not wear them, and even they now ""feel social pressure"" to do so.""This is the first time hackers have really felt that they are like the designers of civil engineering projects,"" she adds.""Because we trust the people a lot, sometimes the people trust back.""The relationship between Taiwan's authorities and the general population wasn't always so smooth.There were recriminations following 2003's severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (Sars), when the response was ""very chaotic"", says Ms Tang.Part of the problem was that the government failed to create a centralised body to coordinate its response.Leaders learned the lesson, and in 2004 established the National Health Command Centre to ensure that, in future crises, government agencies would work better together. They also ordered stockpiles of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be kept at a level that would be sufficient to deal with the early stage of any future pandemic.In 2014, there was more civil strife when citizens stormed the parliament building to protest against a trade agreement which many felt brought Taiwan too close to China. Most of all they objected to how they hadn't been listened to by those in power. The event became known as the Sunflower Revolution because protesters used the flower as a symbol of hope.Among their number were a band of civil hackers, who collaborated on programs that used available data to solve challenges facing society. The government subsequently invited them to find ways to crowdsource and analyse citizens' views and insights, to better influence the creation of new laws.Ms Tang - herself a civic hacker at the time - suggests that Taiwan's government was quick to counter the threat of the coronavirus, in part, because past crises had taught it the value of being more responsive.So when a 'netizen' re-posted to Taiwan's equivalent of Reddit a warning from Wuhan of a Sars-like illness, in the early hours at the end of December, people upvoted it - and the authorities paid attention.That message turned out to be from Dr Li Wenliang, the Chinese whistleblower who first alerted the world to Covid-19.Soon after, targeted sections of the population were tested and traced if they had just returned from Wuhan and recently experienced any health issues. It worked - and the virus was stopped in its tracks. There are other reasons why Taiwan has been able to suppress Covid-19.Earlier this week, Chien-Jen Chen - the island's former vice-president and a renowned epidemiologist - told British MPs that a well-designed contact tracing system and the application of strict quarantine rules to inbound visitors had also played a major role.But he too said the nature of the island's ""hyper-democracy"" - and the efforts its health chiefs had made to gain the public's trust - were the key factors in it success.Those in power aren't just responsive to the voices of citizens, but also the memes and other messages they share.It helped the government counter false claims that the material used to make masks was the same as that found in toilet paper. In response Taiwan's Premier posted a self-mocking cartoon, which showed his bottom wiggling, alongside an explanation of the different sources that toilet paper and mask paper come from. ""It went absolutely viral"" says Ms Tang, of the government strategy referred to as ""humour over rumour"". The strategy uses catchy tweet-length posts, which are designed to spread more quickly than misinformation.""The chances are that most people will see... the clarification message before the rumour,"" explains Ms Tang.""Then they will have herd immunity - or, in the case of a meme, nerd immunity,"" she jokes.At a time when trust in the authorities is becoming frayed elsewhere, Ms Tang suggests Taiwan illustrates there is an alternative to a top-down approach, should a second wave of the virus hit.But ""that decision must be made by the entire society"", she adds.",7 June 2020,technology
How Bill Gates became the voodoo doll of Covid conspiracies,"In 2015, an unassuming-looking Bill Gates came on stage at the TED conference in Vancouver to issue a dire warning.""If anything kills over 10 million people over the next few decades, it is likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than war,"" he told the audience.His prescient words picked up some coverage at the time, including from the BBC - but largely went unheeded.But now, the video of this talk has now been viewed more than 64 million times - with many people more interested in the reasons behind that speech than the talk itself.Some accuse of him of leading a class of global elites. Others believe he is leading efforts to depopulate the world.  Still more accuse him of making vaccines mandatory, or even attempting to implant microchips into people.""There are myriad conspiracies surrounding Bill Gates,"" said Rory Smith, from fact-checkers First Draft News.""He is this kind of voodoo doll that all these communities are pricking with their own conspiracies. And it is unsurprising he has become the voodoo doll - because he has always been the face of public health.""Theories falsely linking Bill Gates to the coronavirus were mentioned 1.2 million times on television or social media between February and April, according to a study by The New York Times and Zignal Labs.Much of the content is posted to public Facebook groups, from where it is shared millions of times. First Draft News has also found that Chinese viral video site TikTok is becoming a new home for such conspiracies.The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been researching some of the more outlandish ones. So how did the founder of Microsoft, who has poured billions into global healthcare from the philanthropic foundation he runs with his wife Melinda, become the bogeyman of Covid-19 conspiracy theorists?Prof Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and author of books on conspiracy theories, believes it is simply because he is rich and famous.""Conspiracy theories are about accusing powerful people of doing terrible things,"" he told the BBC. ""The theories are basically the same, just the names change.""Before Bill Gates, it was George Soros and the Koch brothers and the Rothchilds and the Rockefellers.""And while the majority of conspiracy theories ""die on the vine"", the ones that endure are those that offer ""big villains and address issues that people care about"".""It should come as no surprise that rich people and big corporations are being accused of conspiring to put chips in our necks because that is a thing we fear,"" he said.""This has been the ammo of conspiracy theories for a long, long time.""While he thinks such conspiracies have ""no tether to the truth whatsoever"", people still seem to be falling for them. More than a quarter of all Americans and 44% of Republicans believe that Bill Gates wants to use a Covid-19 vaccine to implant microchips under people's skin, according to a survey from Yahoo News and YouGov.Mr Smith thinks that there is often a ""kernel of truth"" which is taken ""way out of context"".So, for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did fund a study, conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year, which looked at the possibility of storing a patient's vaccination history in a pattern of dye. It would be invisible to the naked eye, and could be delivered under the skin at the same time as a vaccine.It is difficult to ascertain the root of conspiracy theories - but it's thought the internet is making them spread further.""Before the internet, they were self-contained and existed only in their own echo chambers or bubbles within certain communities, but the internet allows them to travel across political lines, between communities, so I think there is much more scope to mainstream conspiracy theories than before the internet,"" said Mr Smith.And, he added, conspiracy theories had particularly flourished during this global pandemic because people were ""psychologically vulnerable"".""This crisis is unprecedented in size and scope and the advice shifts as new studies are published. There are large areas of uncertainty and humans abhor uncertainty,"" he said.To deal with it, individuals resort to something he calls collective sense-making.""We grab onto any information to inject some sort of sense and order and that is when the rumour mill starts. Conspiracy theories - and notably Bill Gates conspiracy theories - fill these informational vacuums.""The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed $300m (£240m) to combat Covid-19, has remained sanguine about the barrage of false claims.In a statement to the BBC it said: ""We're concerned about the conspiracy theories being spread online and the damage they could cause to public health.""At a time like this, when the the world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis, it's distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives. Right now, one the best things we can do to stop the spread of Covid-19 is spread the facts.""In an interview with the BBC, Bill Gates expressed surprise that he had become the figurehead of such theories.""It is troubling that there is so much craziness. When we develop the vaccine we will want 80 percent of the population to take it and if they have heard it is a plot and we don't have people willing to take the vaccine that will let the disease continue to kill people.""I'm kind of surprised some of it is focused on me. We are just giving money away, we write the cheque.. and yes we do think about let's protect children against disease but it is nothing to do with chips and that type of stuff. You almost have to laugh sometimes.""",6 June 2020,technology

You don't really see that in many other forms of media.So for us, it's about engagement with large player bases, giving them a great place to go play, find friends and find new games.Many people around the world have had to self-isolate during lockdowns. What role have games played in making them feel less isolated and more socially connected?The nice thing about gaming is it has always been a social activity.In fact, during this lockdown time, we've had over 270 million new friend relationships created on Xbox Live.So not only are people staying connected with their existing friends, they're finding new friends online as they're playing together, which is really great.Lot's of creative industries have had to shut down during the pandemic. But work on video games continues doesn't it?Yeah, it's been a mix. There's certain parts of the creative process in building a game that can happen remotely. But there are certain functions in game production that still require people to be closer together.Today's big triple-A blockbuster games involve hundreds of people coming together to build games.And we have seen a pause in some things, like motion-capture of actors and some symphonic work involving musicians, where people need to be close.But we're still launching games.The teams continue to work and find new ways to work together.",8 June 2020,technology
Tesla battery supplier Catl says new design has one million-mile lifespan,"A Chinese car battery-maker says it is ready to manufacture a product capable of powering a vehicle for 1.2 million miles (two million kilometres) across the course of a 16-year lifespan.By contrast, most automakers only offer warranties ranging from 60,000 to 150,000 miles over a three to eight-year period on their cars' batteries.Contemporary Amperex Technology has not revealed who it intends to supply.But it was previously reported that the battery was co-developed with Tesla.The latest news was revealed in an interview Catl's chairman gave to the Bloomberg news agency.""If someone places an order, we are ready to produce,"" it quoted Zeng Yuqun as saying.He added that it was set, however, to cost a 10% premium over the batteries it already supplies.The company signed a two-year deal to supply batteries for Tesla's Model 3 cars in February. Its other clients include BMW, Daimler, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.Demand for electric vehicles is growing.The European market for EVs and plug-in hybrids grew by 72% in the first three months of the year compared to the same period in 2019, representing 7% of all delivered new cars, according to research firm Canalys.By contrast, the pandemic weighed on the wider market, which as a whole saw deliveries down by 26% for the quarter.The firm said that Catl's claim was ""significant but difficult to verify"".""It is likely to be used as a differentiator by some car-makers when there is a significant difference from one vehicle to another - dramatically affecting resale value,"" said Canalys's chief automotive analyst Chris Jones.He added that this and other factors - including the wider availability of charging points and longer driving ranges - should help tempt more motorists to make the switch to an electric car.In February, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC that the UK might ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars as soon as 2032, to help meet the UK's zero-carbon emission targets.The Sunday Telegraph reported yesterday that the government is considering offering drivers up to £6,000 to swap their existing cars for electric models next month as part of efforts to boost the UK's electric car manufacturing industry.The Nissan Leaf and Mini Electric are made locally, and Property Week has reported that Tesla is also considering opening its own ""gigafactory"" car battery plant in England.However, Catl's own European efforts are currently focused on Germany, where it is building a factory in the eastern town of Erfurt, which is scheduled to start producing lithium-ion car batteries in 2021.",8 June 2020,technology
Huawei launches media blitz as UK weighs its role in 5G networks,"Huawei is launching a newspaper and internet campaign to mark 20 years of business in the UK.In an open letter to the public, the Chinese telecoms company says it is ""as committed as ever"" to provide ""the best equipment"" to the UK's 5G mobile and full-fibre broadband providers.It comes amid a new security review that could lead the UK government to ban use of Huawei's 5G network kit.Huawei's local boss said he expects the UK to act in the nation's interests.The initiative follows a report in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, which said London-headquartered bank HSBC fears it could face reprisals in China, if the UK acts against Huawei.The Sunday Times also reported that China's ambassador to the UK had recently told business leaders that Beijing viewed the matter as ""a litmus test of whether Britain is a true and faithful partner"". Victor Zhang, vice president of Huawei and head of its UK operations, told the BBC the advertising campaign was about giving people the facts amid all the ""noise"" surrounding the company.He said he hoped the UK would take an ""evidence and fact-based approach"" and warned of huge economic impact if greater connectivity was delayed by the company's exclusion, potentially running into the tens of billions of pounds of lost productivity benefits. ""We need to work closely to address the issue, but we need to take action to accelerate the broadband deployment,"" he said. ""We don't have time to delay this.""Huawei's first significant global breakthrough came in the UK in 2005, when it signed a deal to upgrade BT's copper broadband service, five years after having entered the market.And 15 years later, the UK government's decision to allow Huawei a role in the country's 5G mobile networks represented another crucial victory.In January, ministers announced that Huawei's market share would be capped at 35%, and it would be excluded from sensitive locations, as well as the so-called ""core"" of the network, which is likened to the brains of the system.It appeared that the Chinese tech giant had avoided the outright ban that the US had been pressing for, on the grounds that the firm poses a national security risk.But a backbench rebellion by Conservative MPs in March and then the coronavirus crisis have heightened political pressure for the UK to be less dependent on China.And Washington's campaign has also not relented since January's decision, despite Huawei's repeated denials that it would ever compromise its clients. In May, the US placed significant new sanctions on the company, which limits its access to American computer chip technology. ""We think this decision will heavily impact on the global supply chain of the semiconductor industry,"" Mr Zhang told the BBC. ""We need to work out a solution.""Mr Zhang said that it was still too early for the company to draw any conclusion about the impact, and promised to share details of its own review when complete. However, the sanctions prompted the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to carry out its own review. NCSC is expected to report in the coming weeks, and may say it has lost confidence it can manage the risks associated with Huawei being involved in 5G.That could open the way for the government to shift its position to further reducing, or even eventually eliminating Huawei's role. That could be costly to mobile operators, leading to higher bills for customers. It could also mean their rollout of 5G in the UK is slower.The advertising campaign also highlights Huawei's support of British universities and other institutions, which might also be affected, were the company to be blocked.""We believe the UK will definitely review this based on the facts and the evidence, because the UK will take its own interests very seriously,"" Mr Zhang said. The founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei was reported by the Wall Street Journal on Saturday to have told staff in 2018 that the company was in a battle with the US and they should ""surge forward, killing as you go, to blaze us a trail of blood"". Asked about the language, Mr Zhang said it reflected a sense that Huawei was under intense attack from the United States. ""We are very vulnerable and we know America tried to attack Huawei with so called security reasons which are actually totally wrong,"" he said.""It is simply because of trade and protectionism.""

Coronavirus: How map hacks and buttocks helped Taiwan fight Covid-19,"With direct flights to Wuhan and a population of 24 million people living in densely packed cities, Taiwan's coronavirus outlook seemed grave.But, to date, the disease has claimed just seven lives on the island, and it never went into full lockdown.Its leaders credit masks as playing a key role, but not for the reasons you might suppose.""Masks are something that, first, reminds you to wash your hands properly and, second, protects you from touching your mouth - that is the main benefit to the person who wears it,"" explains Audrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister. Taiwan's citizens have worn face masks for health and other reasons since the 1950s, but the spread of coronavirus prompted a spate of panic-buying.To even out demand, the masks had to be rationed while production was ramped up, from two million to 20 million items a day.Long queues snaked back from pharmacies and other outlets - which posed a risk of contagion in themselves. So, the government decided data about each location's stock levels should be made publicly available.To do so, Ms Tang's ministry launched a platform which each vendor could keep updated with their stock numbers.Then, Taiwan's hacking community, with whom the government had been building a strong relationship for years, stepped in.It began drawing on the data, which had been made public, to build a series of real-time 'mask maps'. These provided residents with up-to-date information on where they could find masks close to their homes or work, with details of how many were available to buy.As the maps grew in popularity, more hacking teams joined in and added features like voice-control for users with visual impairments.More than 10 million people have used the mask apps.The result, says Ms Tang, is that these days only a minority do not wear them, and even they now ""feel social pressure"" to do so.""This is the first time hackers have really felt that they are like the designers of civil engineering projects,"" she adds.""Because we trust the people a lot, sometimes the people trust back.""The relationship between Taiwan's authorities and the general population wasn't always so smooth.There were recriminations following 2003's severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (Sars), when the response was ""very chaotic"", says Ms Tang.Part of the problem was that the government failed to create a centralised body to coordinate its response.Leaders learned the lesson, and in 2004 established the National Health Command Centre to ensure that, in future crises, government agencies would work better together. They also ordered stockpiles of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be kept at a level that would be sufficient to deal with the early stage of any future pandemic.In 2014, there was more civil strife when citizens stormed the parliament building to protest against a trade agreement which many felt brought Taiwan too close to China. Most of all they objected to how they hadn't been listened to by those in power. The event became known as the Sunflower Revolution because protesters used the flower as a symbol of hope.Among their number were a band of civil hackers, who collaborated on programs that used available data to solve challenges facing society. The government subsequently invited them to find ways to crowdsource and analyse citizens' views and insights, to better influence the creation of new laws.Ms Tang - herself a civic hacker at the time - suggests that Taiwan's government was quick to counter the threat of the coronavirus, in part, because past crises had taught it the value of being more responsive.So when a 'netizen' re-posted to Taiwan's equivalent of Reddit a warning from Wuhan of a Sars-like illness, in the early hours at the end of December, people upvoted it - and the authorities paid attention.That message turned out to be from Dr Li Wenliang, the Chinese whistleblower who first alerted the world to Covid-19.Soon after, targeted sections of the population were tested and traced if they had just returned from Wuhan and recently experienced any health issues. It worked - and the virus was stopped in its tracks. There are other reasons why Taiwan has been able to suppress Covid-19.Earlier this week, Chien-Jen Chen - the island's former vice-president and a renowned epidemiologist - told British MPs that a well-designed contact tracing system and the application of strict quarantine rules to inbound visitors had also played a major role.But he too said the nature of the island's ""hyper-democracy"" - and the efforts its health chiefs had made to gain the public's trust - were the key factors in it success.Those in power aren't just responsive to the voices of citizens, but also the memes and other messages they share.It helped the government counter false claims that the material used to make masks was the same as that found in toilet paper. In response Taiwan's Premier posted a self-mocking cartoon, which showed his bottom wiggling, alongside an explanation of the different sources that toilet paper and mask paper come from. ""It went absolutely viral"" says Ms Tang, of the government strategy referred to as ""humour over rumour"". The strategy uses catchy tweet-length posts, which are designed to spread more quickly than misinformation.""The chances are that most people will see... the clarification message before the rumour,"" explains Ms Tang.""Then they will have herd immunity - or, in the case of a meme, nerd immunity,"" she jokes.At a time when trust in the authorities is becoming frayed elsewhere, Ms Tang suggests Taiwan illustrates there is an alternative to a top-down approach, should a second wave of the virus hit.But ""that decision must be made by the entire society"", she adds.",7 June 2020,technology
How Bill Gates became the voodoo doll of Covid conspiracies,"In 2015, an unassuming-looking Bill Gates came on stage at the TED conference in Vancouver to issue a dire warning.""If anything kills over 10 million people over the next few decades, it is likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than war,"" he told the audience.His prescient words picked up some coverage at the time, including from the BBC - but largely went unheeded.But now, the video of this talk has now been viewed more than 64 million times - with many people more interested in the reasons behind that speech than the talk itself.Some accuse of him of leading a class of global elites. Others believe he is leading efforts to depopulate the world.  Still more accuse him of making vaccines mandatory, or even attempting to implant microchips into people.""There are myriad conspiracies surrounding Bill Gates,"" said Rory Smith, from fact-checkers First Draft News.""He is this kind of voodoo doll that all these communities are pricking with their own conspiracies. And it is unsurprising he has become the voodoo doll - because he has always been the face of public health.""Theories falsely linking Bill Gates to the coronavirus were mentioned 1.2 million times on television or social media between February and April, according to a study by The New York Times and Zignal Labs.Much of the content is posted to public Facebook groups, from where it is shared millions of times. First Draft News has also found that Chinese viral video site TikTok is becoming a new home for such conspiracies.The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been researching some of the more outlandish ones. So how did the founder of Microsoft, who has poured billions into global healthcare from the philanthropic foundation he runs with his wife Melinda, become the bogeyman of Covid-19 conspiracy theorists?Prof Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and author of books on conspiracy theories, believes it is simply because he is rich and famous.""Conspiracy theories are about accusing powerful people of doing terrible things,"" he told the BBC. ""The theories are basically the same, just the names change.""Before Bill Gates, it was George Soros and the Koch brothers and the Rothchilds and the Rockefellers.""And while the majority of conspiracy theories ""die on the vine"", the ones that endure are those that offer ""big villains and address issues that people care about"".""It should come as no surprise that rich people and big corporations are being accused of conspiring to put chips in our necks because that is a thing we fear,"" he said.""This has been the ammo of conspiracy theories for a long, long time.""While he thinks such conspiracies have ""no tether to the truth whatsoever"", people still seem to be falling for them. More than a quarter of all Americans and 44% of Republicans believe that Bill Gates wants to use a Covid-19 vaccine to implant microchips under people's skin, according to a survey from Yahoo News and YouGov.Mr Smith thinks that there is often a ""kernel of truth"" which is taken ""way out of context"".So, for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did fund a study, conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year, which looked at the possibility of storing a patient's vaccination history in a pattern of dye. It would be invisible to the naked eye, and could be delivered under the skin at the same time as a vaccine.It is difficult to ascertain the root of conspiracy theories - but it's thought the internet is making them spread further.""Before the internet, they were self-contained and existed only in their own echo chambers or bubbles within certain communities, but the internet allows them to travel across political lines, between communities, so I think there is much more scope to mainstream conspiracy theories than before the internet,"" said Mr Smith.And, he added, conspiracy theories had particularly flourished during this global pandemic because people were ""psychologically vulnerable"".""This crisis is unprecedented in size and scope and the advice shifts as new studies are published. There are large areas of uncertainty and humans abhor uncertainty,"" he said.To deal with it, individuals resort to something he calls collective sense-making.""We grab onto any information to inject some sort of sense and order and that is when the rumour mill starts. Conspiracy theories - and notably Bill Gates conspiracy theories - fill these informational vacuums.""The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed $300m (£240m) to combat Covid-19, has remained sanguine about the barrage of false claims.In a statement to the BBC it said: ""We're concerned about the conspiracy theories being spread online and the damage they could cause to public health.""At a time like this, when the the world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis, it's distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives. Right now, one the best things we can do to stop the spread of Covid-19 is spread the facts.""In an interview with the BBC, Bill Gates expressed surprise that he had become the figurehead of such theories.""It is troubling that there is so much craziness. When we develop the vaccine we will want 80 percent of the population to take it and if they have heard it is a plot and we don't have people willing to take the vaccine that will let the disease continue to kill people.""I'm kind of surprised some of it is focused on me. We are just giving money away, we write the cheque.. and yes we do think about let's protect children against disease but it is nothing to do with chips and that type of stuff. You almost have to laugh sometimes.""",6 June 2020,technology
Xbox Series X: Microsoft tailors launch plans for the pandemic,"The biggest challenge facing Microsoft and Sony's next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - might not be proving the most powerful or having the best games at launch but the fallout from Covid-19.Many gamers will have less spare cash to spend. And there has been speculation supply-chain problems caused by the pandemic will lead to manufacturing delays and higher costs.This was supposed to be the week of the giant E3 games expo, in Los Angeles, a chance to build hype for the launches.Instead, Xbox will give a first look at some games in development via a streamed event in July.In the meantime, Xbox chief Phil Spencer discussed some of the issues on his mind with BBC Click.The interview, below, has been edited for brevity and clarity.How has the pandemic affected your launch plans?Early on, as we were starting to deal with people working from home, there were a lot of questions about what was going to happen with the supply chain and testing our hardware.But when I look at the hardware production now, I feel really good. We have test kits at home and we're all using them, so we can ensure that everything's working the way it should.We're also making good progress with the software platform that we've built to ensure the games run well. And with regards to the supply chain, it looks like builds of the consoles will be uninterrupted.We probably had a couple [of] weeks missing in our testing cycle, just as we got up to speed with things.But I feel like we'll be able to absorb a lot of that into the schedule, and I feel really good about our autumn launch.Do you anticipate any other problems?It looks like we're moving into a period of of massive economic uncertainty.The thing I'm probably focused on the most is the macro-economic environment. We see the impact of people getting furloughed and layoffs. It's tough.And we are a leisure activity. We're not a requirement. We're not food. We're not shelter.So we want to be really tuned in to that as we launch. How can we make it as affordable as possible? How can we give buyers choice? We've got an Xbox All Access subscription programme that allows people to buy their next console by paying a monthly charge.And if now is not the time for you to buy a new console, and you're going to stay with the console you have, we're going to keep supporting that console.And through technologies like smart delivery, you can buy your games and know that when you buy the next console, your games will move with you, to allow consumers to make the choice that's right for them.Won't gamers take into account the console will be at its most expensive at launch?People find real value in the investment that they make in gaming. You can buy a console, buy some games, and it can literally provide your family with hundreds of hours of entertainment.Even when we went back and looked at 2008-09, in that recession, to see what the impact was on gaming - gaming did OK. It was durable.We want to make sure we're providing the right value to customers.Price is going to be important.But our strategy is centred around the player, not the device.If this is not the year when a family wants to make a decision to buy a new Xbox, that's OK. Our strategy does not revolve around how many Xboxes I sell this year.We're focused on delivering services through Xbox Game Pass, which allows people to build their library for a monthly fee. Backward compatibility means that the console that they have will play thousands and thousands of games. Smart delivery means when they move to the next generation, the games will move with them. In the past, there's been an obsession about how many units are sold in the opening weeks and months of a new console's life. Given the pandemic, do you think that won't be the best way to measure the success of the launch this time?I think you already see that from a lot of the platform-holders, who are starting to pivot to engagement metrics than device metrics:We've seen our subscribers play 40% more games than others, which we just think is great in terms of people finding a diversity of content.The cycle in games is a little different than some of the other media out there. Games are very durable, they're played over time, so it's not just about what happened today. One of our biggest games is Minecraft, and it just crossed over 200 million players. We just had one of our biggest months ever in terms of Minecraft usage.The game is 10 years old. You don't really see that in many other forms of media.So for us, it's about engagement with large player bases, giving them a great place to go play, find friends and find new games.Many people around the world have had to self-isolate during lockdowns. What role have games played in making them feel less isolated and more socially connected?The nice thing about gaming is it has always been a social activity.In fact, during this lockdown time, we've had over 270 million new friend relationships created on Xbox Live.So not only are people staying connected with their existing friends, they're finding new friends online as they're playing together, which is really great.Lot's of creative industries have had to shut down during the pandemic. But work on video games continues doesn't it?Yeah, it's been a mix. There's certain parts of the creative process in building a game that can happen remotely. But there are certain functions in game production that still require people to be closer together.Today's big triple-A blockbuster games involve hundreds of people coming together to build games.And we have seen a pause in some things, like motion-capture of actors and some symphonic work involving musicians, where people need to be close.But we're still launching games.The teams continue to work and find new ways to work together.",8 June 2020,technology

There are other reasons why Taiwan has been able to suppress Covid-19.Earlier this week, Chien-Jen Chen - the island's former vice-president and a renowned epidemiologist - told British MPs that a well-designed contact tracing system and the application of strict quarantine rules to inbound visitors had also played a major role.But he too said the nature of the island's ""hyper-democracy"" - and the efforts its health chiefs had made to gain the public's trust - were the key factors in it success.Those in power aren't just responsive to the voices of citizens, but also the memes and other messages they share.It helped the government counter false claims that the material used to make masks was the same as that found in toilet paper. In response Taiwan's Premier posted a self-mocking cartoon, which showed his bottom wiggling, alongside an explanation of the different sources that toilet paper and mask paper come from. ""It went absolutely viral"" says Ms Tang, of the government strategy referred to as ""humour over rumour"". The strategy uses catchy tweet-length posts, which are designed to spread more quickly than misinformation.""The chances are that most people will see... the clarification message before the rumour,"" explains Ms Tang.""Then they will have herd immunity - or, in the case of a meme, nerd immunity,"" she jokes.At a time when trust in the authorities is becoming frayed elsewhere, Ms Tang suggests Taiwan illustrates there is an alternative to a top-down approach, should a second wave of the virus hit.But ""that decision must be made by the entire society"", she adds.",7 June 2020,technology
How Bill Gates became the voodoo doll of Covid conspiracies,"In 2015, an unassuming-looking Bill Gates came on stage at the TED conference in Vancouver to issue a dire warning.""If anything kills over 10 million people over the next few decades, it is likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than war,"" he told the audience.His prescient words picked up some coverage at the time, including from the BBC - but largely went unheeded.But now, the video of this talk has now been viewed more than 64 million times - with many people more interested in the reasons behind that speech than the talk itself.Some accuse of him of leading a class of global elites. Others believe he is leading efforts to depopulate the world.  Still more accuse him of making vaccines mandatory, or even attempting to implant microchips into people.""There are myriad conspiracies surrounding Bill Gates,"" said Rory Smith, from fact-checkers First Draft News.""He is this kind of voodoo doll that all these communities are pricking with their own conspiracies. And it is unsurprising he has become the voodoo doll - because he has always been the face of public health.""Theories falsely linking Bill Gates to the coronavirus were mentioned 1.2 million times on television or social media between February and April, according to a study by The New York Times and Zignal Labs.Much of the content is posted to public Facebook groups, from where it is shared millions of times. First Draft News has also found that Chinese viral video site TikTok is becoming a new home for such conspiracies.The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been researching some of the more outlandish ones. So how did the founder of Microsoft, who has poured billions into global healthcare from the philanthropic foundation he runs with his wife Melinda, become the bogeyman of Covid-19 conspiracy theorists?Prof Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and author of books on conspiracy theories, believes it is simply because he is rich and famous.""Conspiracy theories are about accusing powerful people of doing terrible things,"" he told the BBC. ""The theories are basically the same, just the names change.""Before Bill Gates, it was George Soros and the Koch brothers and the Rothchilds and the Rockefellers.""And while the majority of conspiracy theories ""die on the vine"", the ones that endure are those that offer ""big villains and address issues that people care about"".""It should come as no surprise that rich people and big corporations are being accused of conspiring to put chips in our necks because that is a thing we fear,"" he said.""This has been the ammo of conspiracy theories for a long, long time.""While he thinks such conspiracies have ""no tether to the truth whatsoever"", people still seem to be falling for them. More than a quarter of all Americans and 44% of Republicans believe that Bill Gates wants to use a Covid-19 vaccine to implant microchips under people's skin, according to a survey from Yahoo News and YouGov.Mr Smith thinks that there is often a ""kernel of truth"" which is taken ""way out of context"".So, for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did fund a study, conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year, which looked at the possibility of storing a patient's vaccination history in a pattern of dye. It would be invisible to the naked eye, and could be delivered under the skin at the same time as a vaccine.It is difficult to ascertain the root of conspiracy theories - but it's thought the internet is making them spread further.""Before the internet, they were self-contained and existed only in their own echo chambers or bubbles within certain communities, but the internet allows them to travel across political lines, between communities, so I think there is much more scope to mainstream conspiracy theories than before the internet,"" said Mr Smith.And, he added, conspiracy theories had particularly flourished during this global pandemic because people were ""psychologically vulnerable"".""This crisis is unprecedented in size and scope and the advice shifts as new studies are published. There are large areas of uncertainty and humans abhor uncertainty,"" he said.To deal with it, individuals resort to something he calls collective sense-making.""We grab onto any information to inject some sort of sense and order and that is when the rumour mill starts. Conspiracy theories - and notably Bill Gates conspiracy theories - fill these informational vacuums.""The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed $300m (£240m) to combat Covid-19, has remained sanguine about the barrage of false claims.In a statement to the BBC it said: ""We're concerned about the conspiracy theories being spread online and the damage they could cause to public health.""At a time like this, when the the world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis, it's distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives. Right now, one the best things we can do to stop the spread of Covid-19 is spread the facts.""In an interview with the BBC, Bill Gates expressed surprise that he had become the figurehead of such theories.""It is troubling that there is so much craziness. When we develop the vaccine we will want 80 percent of the population to take it and if they have heard it is a plot and we don't have people willing to take the vaccine that will let the disease continue to kill people.""I'm kind of surprised some of it is focused on me. We are just giving money away, we write the cheque.. and yes we do think about let's protect children against disease but it is nothing to do with chips and that type of stuff. You almost have to laugh sometimes.""",6 June 2020,technology
Elon Musk calls for 'break up' of Amazon,"Elon Musk has called for the ""break up"" of tech giant Amazon, following a dispute about a coronavirus e-book.The entrepreneur came to the defence of an author after Amazon's Kindle publishing division rejected his book about the coronavirus pandemic.Mr Musk tagged Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos in a tweet, saying the decision was ""insane"", adding: ""Time to break up Amazon.""Amazon said the book had been removed in error and would be reinstated.The author of the book, Alex Berenson, caught Mr Musk's attention by tweeting a screenshot from Amazon, which told him that his book about the pandemic did not meet its guidelines. ""They censored it!"" wrote Mr Berenson. ""It is based entirely on published government data and scientific papers. It doesn't say coronavirus isn't real or doesn't kill people."" Mr Musk has been a critical of government policies during the coronavirus pandemic. He has previously described shutdown orders as ""fascist"" and threatened to move Tesla's headquarters out of California when a production facility was not allowed to reopen.  Mr Musk and Mr Bezos are rivals in a race to make space travel more affordable. Mr Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, two years after Mr Bezos started his rocket firm Blue Origin.Last year, Mr Bezos criticised Mr Musk's hope of creating a Mars colony. According to Business Insider, he said: ""My friends who want to move to Mars? I say do me a favour: Go live on the top of Mount Everest for a year first and see if you like it because it's a garden paradise compared to Mars.""",5 June 2020,technology
Twitter accuses President Trump of making 'false claims',"Twitter has accused the US president of making false claims, in one of the app's own articles covering the news.The move - which effectively accuses the leader of lying - refers to a tweet by Donald Trump about his first defence secretary.Mr Trump had tweeted that he had given James Mattis the nickname ""Mad Dog"" and later fired him.But Twitter's article says that the former general resigned, and his nickname preceded Trump's presidency.It follows last week's explosive confrontation, which saw Twitter fact-check two of President Trump's tweets and label another as glorifying violence.The latest confrontation was prompted by a strongly-worded statement issued by General Mattis last night, in which he criticised the president's handling of the protests that followed the killing of George Floyd.Gen Mattis described Donald Trump as ""the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us.""The president fired back quickly in a tweet saying that the one thing he and predecessor Barack Obama had in common was ""we both had the honour of firing Jim Mattis, the world's most overrated general. I asked for his letter of resignation and felt good about it"".""His nickname was 'Chaos', which I didn't like, and changed it to 'Mad Dog',"" he added.Twitter later published what it calls a Moment, a summary of a news story that you can see when you press the platform's search button. It has also been promoted within the What's Happening box that appears on Twitter's website.The article says that ""Mattis resigned from the position... after the administration decided to withdraw US troops from Syria"", and attributes the fact to a report by the Associated Press news agency.It then refers to journalists at CNN, the National Review, the Washington Post and The Dispatch as having written that the nickname 'Mad Dog' had been used before Trump's presidency, with published references dating back to 2004.Moments are curated by an internal team at Twitter. They provide a summary of a recent development before presenting some related tweets.This is not the first time the tool has been used to call out Donald Trump.In March 2019, it said the president had misidentified a co-founder of Greenpeace, and in April 2020 it said he had falsely claimed he could force states to reopen during the Covid-19 pandemic.But what is interesting here is that Twitter has chosen to raise the temperature of its clash with the president over what could be seen as a relatively minor issue. It was on 20 December 2018 that Gen Mattis announced his resignation, effective from 28 February 2019. A furious Mr Trump then announced his defence secretary was going from 1 January and stated he'd essentially fired him. So you could at least argue that, as in many cases, there is a blurry line between a resignation and a firing.Perhaps Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey is looking on, with a degree of schadenfreude, at what has happened in recent days at Facebook. There, Mark Zuckerberg's determination not to follow Twitter's lead and take some kind of action over the president's posts has sparked open revolt.Facebook staff, who previously would only grumble anonymously about the company's practices, have put their names to statements deploring Mr Zuckerberg's failure to act. This morning, nearly three dozen former employees, including some who had helped write the original guidelines on what can and cannot be posted, published an open letter accusing Mr Zuckerberg of a ""betrayal"" of Facebook's ideals.Last week, it felt as though Twitter might be putting its future in danger by taking on the president. This week, it feels as though Mr Zuckerberg's failure to act might leave him facing an even bigger crisis than the Cambridge Analytica scandal.",4 June 2020,technology
Tesla battery supplier Catl says new design has one million-mile lifespan,"A Chinese car battery-maker says it is ready to manufacture a product capable of powering a vehicle for 1.2 million miles (two million kilometres) across the course of a 16-year lifespan.By contrast, most automakers only offer warranties ranging from 60,000 to 150,000 miles over a three to eight-year period on their cars' batteries.Contemporary Amperex Technology has not revealed who it intends to supply.But it was previously reported that the battery was co-developed with Tesla.The latest news was revealed in an interview Catl's chairman gave to the Bloomberg news agency.""If someone places an order, we are ready to produce,"" it quoted Zeng Yuqun as saying.He added that it was set, however, to cost a 10% premium over the batteries it already supplies.The company signed a two-year deal to supply batteries for Tesla's Model 3 cars in February. Its other clients include BMW, Daimler, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.Demand for electric vehicles is growing.The European market for EVs and plug-in hybrids grew by 72% in the first three months of the year compared to the same period in 2019, representing 7% of all delivered new cars, according to research firm Canalys.By contrast, the pandemic weighed on the wider market, which as a whole saw deliveries down by 26% for the quarter.The firm said that Catl's claim was ""significant but difficult to verify"".""It is likely to be used as a differentiator by some car-makers when there is a significant difference from one vehicle to another - dramatically affecting resale value,"" said Canalys's chief automotive analyst Chris Jones.He added that this and other factors - including the wider availability of charging points and longer driving ranges - should help tempt more motorists to make the switch to an electric car.In February, the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC that the UK might ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars as soon as 2032, to help meet the UK's zero-carbon emission targets.The Sunday Telegraph reported yesterday that the government is considering offering drivers up to £6,000 to swap their existing cars for electric models next month as part of efforts to boost the UK's electric car manufacturing industry.The Nissan Leaf and Mini Electric are made locally, and Property Week has reported that Tesla is also considering opening its own ""gigafactory"" car battery plant in England.However, Catl's own European efforts are currently focused on Germany, where it is building a factory in the eastern town of Erfurt, which is scheduled to start producing lithium-ion car batteries in 2021.",8 June 2020,technology
Xbox Series X: Microsoft tailors launch plans for the pandemic,"The biggest challenge facing Microsoft and Sony's next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 - might not be proving the most powerful or having the best games at launch but the fallout from Covid-19.Many gamers will have less spare cash to spend. And there has been speculation supply-chain problems caused by the pandemic will lead to manufacturing delays and higher costs.This was supposed to be the week of the giant E3 games expo, in Los Angeles, a chance to build hype for the launches.Instead, Xbox will give a first look at some games in development via a streamed event in July.In the meantime, Xbox chief Phil Spencer discussed some of the issues on his mind with BBC Click.The interview, below, has been edited for brevity and clarity.How has the pandemic affected your launch plans?Early on, as we were starting to deal with people working from home, there were a lot of questions about what was going to happen with the supply chain and testing our hardware.But when I look at the hardware production now, I feel really good. We have test kits at home and we're all using them, so we can ensure that everything's working the way it should.We're also making good progress with the software platform that we've built to ensure the games run well. And with regards to the supply chain, it looks like builds of the consoles will be uninterrupted.We probably had a couple [of] weeks missing in our testing cycle, just as we got up to speed with things.But I feel like we'll be able to absorb a lot of that into the schedule, and I feel really good about our autumn launch.Do you anticipate any other problems?It looks like we're moving into a period of of massive economic uncertainty.The thing I'm probably focused on the most is the macro-economic environment. We see the impact of people getting furloughed and layoffs. It's tough.And we are a leisure activity. We're not a requirement. We're not food. We're not shelter.So we want to be really tuned in to that as we launch. How can we make it as affordable as possible? How can we give buyers choice? We've got an Xbox All Access subscription programme that allows people to buy their next console by paying a monthly charge.And if now is not the time for you to buy a new console, and you're going to stay with the console you have, we're going to keep supporting that console.And through technologies like smart delivery, you can buy your games and know that when you buy the next console, your games will move with you, to allow consumers to make the choice that's right for them.Won't gamers take into account the console will be at its most expensive at launch?People find real value in the investment that they make in gaming. You can buy a console, buy some games, and it can literally provide your family with hundreds of hours of entertainment.Even when we went back and looked at 2008-09, in that recession, to see what the impact was on gaming - gaming did OK. It was durable.We want to make sure we're providing the right value to customers.Price is going to be important.But our strategy is centred around the player, not the device.If this is not the year when a family wants to make a decision to buy a new Xbox, that's OK. Our strategy does not revolve around how many Xboxes I sell this year.We're focused on delivering services through Xbox Game Pass, which allows people to build their library for a monthly fee. Backward compatibility means that the console that they have will play thousands and thousands of games. Smart delivery means when they move to the next generation, the games will move with them. In the past, there's been an obsession about how many units are sold in the opening weeks and months of a new console's life. Given the pandemic, do you think that won't be the best way to measure the success of the launch this time?I think you already see that from a lot of the platform-holders, who are starting to pivot to engagement metrics than device metrics:We've seen our subscribers play 40% more games than others, which we just think is great in terms of people finding a diversity of content.The cycle in games is a little different than some of the other media out there. Games are very durable, they're played over time, so it's not just about what happened today. One of our biggest games is Minecraft, and it just crossed over 200 million players. We just had one of our biggest months ever in terms of Minecraft usage.The game is 10 years old. You don't really see that in many other forms of media.So for us, it's about engagement with large player bases, giving them a great place to go play, find friends and find new games.Many people around the world have had to self-isolate during lockdowns. What role have games played in making them feel less isolated and more socially connected?The nice thing about gaming is it has always been a social activity.In fact, during this lockdown time, we've had over 270 million new friend relationships created on Xbox Live.So not only are people staying connected with their existing friends, they're finding new friends online as they're playing together, which is really great.Lot's of creative industries have had to shut down during the pandemic. But work on video games continues doesn't it?Yeah, it's been a mix. There's certain parts of the creative process in building a game that can happen remotely. But there are certain functions in game production that still require people to be closer together.Today's big triple-A blockbuster games involve hundreds of people coming together to build games.And we have seen a pause in some things, like motion-capture of actors and some symphonic work involving musicians, where people need to be close.But we're still launching games.The teams continue to work and find new ways to work together.",8 June 2020,technology
