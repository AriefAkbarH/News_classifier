Coronavirus: Hairdressers offer virtual appointments in lockdown,"Hairdressers have been offering virtual appointments to help people style their hair at home.Stylists are using apps including FaceTime, Zoom, and YouTube to provide customers live one-to-one advice and tutorials.While salons have already reopened in France and Germany, hairdressers in the UK expect to remain closed until July.An industry report estimated the hair and beauty sector contributed Â£6.6bn to the country's economy last year.Paul Phillips owns Chopp Hair salon in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, which shut in March when the coronavirus lockdown began.He provides a service called Chopp Drops, in which he delivers hair products to customersâ doorsteps and then demonstrates via video call how to apply the treatment.âMost hairdressers say you should never colour your hair at home, and in normal times Iâd agree,â he says. âBut lots of clientsâ mental health has been affected by the current situation, so sorting out grey roots and split ends makes them feel better.âPaul says he serves up to 26 clients a day, but adds that he is cautious to only offer advice that is achievable at home.âItâs too technical to dye blonde hair, so those clients sadly have to sit tight and wait for the lockdown to be over,â he explains. âYou donât want somebody to mess up and then have to live with it for another seven weeks.âMost of the hairdressers the BBC spoke to offered bespoke hair kits and virtual appointments priced between Â£30 and Â£150.Ebuni Ajiduah is a hair loss-specialist. She has also moved her appointments online, offering clients home treatments, and when required referring them to dermatologists for further advice. âPeople now have the time to focus on things they may have neglected,â she says, adding that sheâs seen an increased demand for her services.Ebuni has also launched a Virtual Wash Day every Sunday, when she invites people to join her on Zoom to wash, treat, and style hair together.âWe talk about the products we use and how we twist our hair,â she says. âItâs really nice, you get some people in shower caps and others trying to keep their kids still.âIt gives people a sense of normalcy when the world is on fire - you can still have a routine and focus time on yourself.âSome hairdressers advise against cutting your own hair but are still offering other tips online.âI've trimmed mine at the front but even I wouldn't attempt [to cut] mine at the back,â Michael Van Clarke says in a video on Instagram. Instead, he proceeds to show the audience how to style short hair that has grown out over a few weeks.Since closing its doors, the team from his salon has been posting videos on social media and booking virtual colour consultations, serving more than 3,000 customers online.âWe have new clients which have never even been to our salon, the demand is huge,â Mr Van Clarke says. âItâs a lot easier to do the video consultations if weâve seen them in person before, but we are still able to give advice to new customers.âSenior technicians carry out a hair assessment over an initial video call, advise on treatments and products, send them out and then offer a follow-up consultation to observe and guide the client.âSome people like their hands held for reassurance, so our technicians can show them how to hold the brush and how long to leave colour on for,â Mr Van Clarke adds.Gina Conway, who runs three salons in London, thinks this could become the ""new normal"".âEven when lockdown is over, itâs going to be chaos,â she explains. âSome people might not be able to afford to go to the salon, they might be working from home or looking after children still, so I hope we can relieve that stress through technology.âGina says sheâs now pivoting to focus on the internet.âAt first I was hesitant as I wanted to keep my business as professional as possible, but this is our way of giving proper advice and helping people to feel good about themselves.â",25 May 2020,technology
How Coronavirus lockdown made a 'Zoom boom' generation,"I first realised just how quickly attitudes towards technology were changing when my mum told me, two days after lockdown began, that she had downloaded Skype.She's not exactly an early adopter - in fact, she has resolutely refused to video call anybody, ever, until now.Lockdown has removed the luxury of choice for many of us. If you want to see your relatives, it has to be on screen.As we get over the social awkwardness of the ""Zoom boom"" - when to mute that mic, when to stop talking - we're realising that, for the most part, video chat works. Whether it's family reunions, pub quizzes, office meetings or even pet appointments with the vet, we can get together quickly without being in the same room - and there's a good chance that is going to stick.Twitter has already told its staff they don't ever need to go back into the office again, and Cambridge University says its lectures will remain purely online until the summer of 2021. This week Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that up to 50% of the workforce could be working from home in the next 5-10 years. The tech giant's head of Virtual Reality, Andrew Bosworth, shared a fascinating video of what a mixed reality workspace - a combination of the real world and digital images - might look like.As we think through supercharging remote work and productivity, we've been working on mixed reality concepts that builds on existing technologies like Passthrough to allow people to switch between real and virtual worlds pic.twitter.com/cJCEXDxC7bEnd of Twitter post  by @boztankBroadly speaking the internet infrastructure has coped pretty well with everyone piling onto it - at least for those with access to more robust services.Some experts have long called for the net to be recognised as a public utility, alongside electricity, water and gas - as well as the requisite regulation that comes with it - and perhaps it has finally earned its spurs. John Graham-Cumming, from internet security firm Cloudflare, said the company is now seeing three daily peaks for internet traffic around the world - first thing in the morning, lunchtime and early evening - and they are bigger than ever.""If you think about the internet as a utility, can you think of another utility that could sustain 50% growth [in traffic]?"" he said.""The net has been a reliable sidekick through all this."" And the tech firms have certainly spotted their opportunity. Microsoft's Satya Nadella says digital transformation has advanced two years in two months, as we seek to be entertained, to be connected and to keep track of what is happening during the pandemic.We can already see investment and goodwill getting behind tech alternatives in the hunt for new ways of doing things: could this be the moment drone deliveries finally take off (pardon the pun), e-scooters get an easier ride, and virtual gyms put our post-lockdown bodies through their paces, via a headset, in the comfort of our own homes?History will eventually reveal whether lockdown was the dawn of a new era or merely a blip before things returned to the way they were.For tech to truly prove itself as a game-changer, it has to become part of the furniture: consistent, reliable and, therefore, totally unremarkable. And as anyone who has experienced an unexpected outage at a frustrating moment in the past few weeks will tell you, we're not quite there yet.",25 May 2020,technology

Coronavirus: Huawei urges UK not to make 5G U-turn after pandemic,"Chinese telecoms company Huawei has said that disrupting its involvement in the rollout of 5G would do Britain ""a disservice"".In January, the UK government approved a limited role for Huawei in building the country's new data networks.But in March, a backbench rebellion within the Conservative party signalled efforts to overturn the move.In an open letter, the firm also said it was focused on keeping the UK connected during the Covid-19 crisis. But the pandemic may increase pressure on the government to take a tougher line on the company.In the letter, Huawei's UK chief Victor Zhang says home data use has increased by at least 50% since the virus first hit the UK, placing ""significant pressure"" on telecoms systems. Huawei says it has been working with partners like BT, Vodafone and EE to deal with the growth and has also set up three new warehouses around the country to ensure spare parts stay in supply. Mr Zhang also says the current crisis has highlighted how many people, especially in rural communities, are ""stuck in a digital slow lane"". And he warns that excluding Huawei from a future role in 5G would be a mistake. ""There are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence,"" he writes.""Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice.""The government has banned Huawei from the most sensitive parts of the UK's mobile networks, and limited it to 35% of the periphery, which includes its radio masts.But critics argue it is a security risk to allow the Chinese company to play any role at all because of fears it could be used by Beijing to spy on or even sabotage communications.  In early March, 38 Conservatives MPs rebelled on the issue, a larger number than expected.

Wikipedia sets new rule to combat âtoxic behaviourâ,"Wikipedia is to institute a new code of conduct to battle what the firm called ""toxic behaviour"" by some volunteers.The Wikimedia Foundation, the organisation that runs the site, voted on new measures that will be finalised by the end of the year.Wikipedia is written and updated by volunteers. Many, particularly women and members of the LGBTQ community, have complained of abuse and harassment from other editors.Wikimedia's board of trustees said maintaining civility was a core value.""We must work together to create a safe, inclusive culture, where everyone feels welcome, that their contributions are valued, and that their perspective matters,"" said Katherine Maher, the chief executive officer of the Wikimedia Foundation.""Our goal is all the world's knowledge, and this is an essential step on our journey.""The foundation's binding code of conduct for members will include banning or limiting access if volunteers violate the terms.There will be a review process for the decisions if volunteers feel more context is needed. Wikipedia has become one of the internet's most trusted sources for information, but complaints about gender imbalances and harassment have plagued the platform for close to a decade.A study from the University of Washington on the gender gap in Wikipedia editors found many female and LGBTQ editors feared for their safety. Several female editors told the researchers their work had contested by male editors or that they received negative feedback from a male editor. A New York Times article from 2019 also highlighted the concerns some transgender editors have about volunteering for the site. One editor told the paper they received death threats. Wikipedia is not a formal social media platform like Facebook or Twitter. But its editors can interact with one another and can change the content on a page after it has been written.This has led to a form of harassment where, after one volunteer adds to a page, another volunteer will remove or change that work moments later, forcing the first editor to redo their work and leading to editing battles.The development of a new code of conduct will take place in two phases.The first will include setting policies for in-person and virtual events as well as policies for technical spaces including chat rooms and other Wikimedia projects. It is set to be ratified by the board by 30 August.A second phase outlining enforcement when the rules are broken will be approved by the end of the year, according to the board's plan.",23 May 2020,technology
Huawei: What would happen if the UK ditched the Chinese firm?,"Huawei's future in the UK is in doubt - again.The consequences could affect how quickly improved internet access is rolled out and how much it will cost. This a time when the country's economy is already in a precarious state because of the coronavirus pandemic.The catalyst for a potential rethink is the US's move to restrict the firm's ability to buy chips, which was justified on ""national security grounds"".On Sunday, the UK's National Security Centre (NCSC) confirmed it was examining what impact this would have on the UK networks that use Huawei's tech.That sounds quite vague. But it potentially paves the way for a government U-turn.In January, the prime minister gave the green light to continued use of the firm's tech in mobile and broadband networks, but said its its market share must be reduced.Now he might appreciate the chance for change of mind.It would help Boris Johnson prevent backbenchers who favour a ban from derailing his forthcoming Telecoms Infrastructure Bill. Moreover, it offers him a way to defuse tensions with the White House, which has said continued use of Huawei will have a ""dramatic impact on our ability to share [security] information"".Mr Johnson and President Trump may meet next month at a mooted G7 summit. Blocking Huawei could help secure a post-Brexit trade deal, even if it made relations with China trickier.But the company warns there would be consequences.""More suppliers means greater competition, innovation and network reliability, and crucially ensures consumers have access to the best possible technology,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief, told the BBC.""Removing Huawei would seriously delay 5G, costing the British economy up to Â£7bn,"" he added, citing a study published last year by Mobile UK, a trade group that represents UK network operators.Part of the reason mobile providers are concerned is that the current version of 5G relies on new equipment being plugged into existing 4G kit from the same vendor.""A lot of the 4G expansion was software-upgradeable to do 5G when an extra mast antenna was fitted,"" explained Andrew Ferguson, editor-in-chief of the news site ThinkBroadband.So, he added, even if a Huawei ban was limited to the newer technology, networks would still have to rip out and replace some of their older infrastructure as well.""It's not only a very expensive process for the operators, but it's going to be a time-consuming one as well because they need to get access to all those sites to make the changes,"" added Matthew Howett from Assembly, the consultancy that wrote Mobile UK's report.""And Huawei has been very innovative at coming up with the smallest and lightest 5G equipment, meaning the operators can sometimes just use a cherry picker to hook it onto existing mast infrastructure. Some of the others' is heavier and bulkier, which can require more in terms of getting planning consent and road closures.""Huawei's major 5G rivals are Nokia and Ericsson - two European firms.The networks claim that having three providers to choose from helps them negotiate lower prices. In many cases, they want a mix of two suppliers so that if technical problems arise with one they can fall back on the other to provide a reduced service. That doesn't always involve Huawei - O2 for instance picked Nokia and Ericsson to be its primary 5G vendors despite having trialled the Chinese firm's kit.A study commissioned by Huawei last year claimed locking it out would increase a country's 5G investment costs by between 8% and 29% due to reduced competition.And if mobile providers have to spend more, consumers can expect their bills to rise too.But one MP opposed to Huawei's rollout says there are more important considerations.""There's a free and fair competition element here, there's a security element, there's a data-privacy element, and there's a sort of geopolitics of Chinese influence as well - the influence of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Bob Seely, a member of the foreign affairs committee, told the BBC.""There shouldn't on principle be high-risk vendors in the communications network.""Huawei denies it uses state subsidies to undercut its rivals, adding that it would never spy on China's behalf or otherwise deliberately compromise its clients.Huawei is also a big player in fixed-line broadband.It currently accounts for about 44% of the equipment used in providing super-fast full-fibre connections directly to homes, office and other buildings, according to UK regulator Ofcom.BT's Openreach division aims to bring that in line with a 35% government target by using more kit from Nokia and the US firm Adtran.But this sidesteps the fact that more properties rely on an alternative set-up in which fibre only reaches roadside cabinets, and the last leg is supplied by a copper-based connection. The reason this is relevant is that tens of thousands of the cabinets involved are Huawei's.""They connect directly to the core of the network,"" commented Mr Ferguson.""But replacing those is a complete non-starter unless someone's going to throw many billions of pounds at it and also all the people to do the work."" While Huawei's opponents would prefer it to be gone altogether, they acknowledge this is impractical in the short term.But Mr Seely suggested that cabinets and other such products should be swapped out for alternatives when they are ""up for replacement"".One thing practically everyone agrees on is that the matter needs to be settled once and for at a time when so much else about the economy is uncertain.""These procurement decisions can take 18 months to two years to finalise and it takes time to ramp up supply to meet the demand,"" said Mr Howett.""So this isn't just a question of overnight deciding not to use Huawei - it would take many years to do it properly.""",26 May 2020,technology
