Australia 'records fastest internet speed ever',"Researchers in Australia claim they have recorded the fastest ever internet data speed.A team from Monash, Swinburne and RMIT universities logged a data speed of 44.2 terabits per second (Tbps). At that speed, users could download more than 1,000 high-definition movies in less than a second. According to Ofcom, the average UK broadband speed currently is around 64 megabits per second (Mbps) - a fraction of that recorded in the recent study.Australia lies in the middle of global rankings for internet speeds, and slow connections are a regular source of complaints from users.Researchers said they achieved the new record speed by using a device that replaces around 80 lasers found in some existing telecoms hardware, with a single piece of equipment known as a 'micro-comb'.The micro-comb was planted into and tested - outside the laboratory - using existing infrastructure, similar to that used by Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN).The result was the highest amount of data ever produced by a single optical chip, which are used in modern fibre-optic broadband systems around the world. The Australian team hope their findings offer a glimpse into how internet connections could look in the future. While the data speed far outstrips any reasonable consumer need in today's world, Bill Corcoran, lecturer in electrical and computer systems at Monash University, said it could ultimately help transform a wide variety of industries  - as modern life continues to put increasing pressure on bandwidth infrastructure. The global lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic has seen the internet infrastructure come under unprecedented strain.""We're currently getting a sneak peek of how the infrastructure for the internet will hold up in two to three years' time, due to the unprecedented number of people using the internet for remote work, socialising and streaming,"" said Mr Corcoran.""What our research demonstrates is the ability for fibres that we already have in the ground... to be the backbone of communications networks now and in the future.""""And it's not just Netflix we're talking about here,"" he added. ""This data can be used for self-driving cars and future transportation, and it can help the medicine, education, finance, and e-commerce industries - as well as enable us to read with our grandchildren from kilometres away.""Professor David Moss, of Swinburne University, described the findings as ""an enormous breakthrough"". ""Micro-combs offer enormous promise for us to meet the world's insatiable demand for bandwidth.""",22 May 2020,technology

NSO Group: Israeli firm 'impersonated Facebook to spread spyware',"Israeli security company NSO Group impersonated Facebook as part of a ploy to get users to install its phone-hacking software, a new report alleges.An investigation from news site Motherboard claims a Facebook security lookalike domain was set up to spread NSO's Pegasus hacking tool.It also claimed to have found evidence that servers inside the United States were used to spread the spying tool.NSO denies the allegations, labelling them ""recycled conjecture"".The Pegasus spyware, once installed, can read text messages and other data on the phone, track its location with GPS, and access the microphone and camera. The Israeli firm is already locked in a legal battle with Facebook, which alleges it deliberately spread its software over WhatsApp, compromising hundreds of phones - including those of journalists and human rights activists. It is also, separately, accused of supplying software to the Saudi government which was allegedly used to spy on journalist Jamal Khashoggi before he was killed.Facebook's complaint alleged NSO operated the spyware itself. But NSO has asked the court in California to dismiss the case, in part because it says it never uses its spyware - only sovereign governments do. Motherboard's latest investigation revolves around a former NSO employee who, it is claimed, provided it with details of a server allegedly designed to distribute the spyware by tricking people into clicking links.The server investigated was connected to several different web addresses over a number of years - including one that impersonated Facebook's security team, the Motherboard report claims.Facebook told the BBC it had gained ownership of the domain in question four years ago, to stop it being misused. Other domains used over time included ""a link a person could click on to unsubscribe themselves from emails or text messages... and package tracking links from FedEx,"" Motherboard reports.But NSO fiercely denies that it has ever used its products itself.""We are incredibly proud of our technology's role in tackling crime and terrorism, but NSO does not operate any of its products,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""As we have repeatedly made clear, NSO products are offered to and operated solely by verified and authorised government agencies.""Motherboard also alleged that one of the servers used to launch the malware was located within the United States - something that NSO says is not possible. Facebook has previously made similar allegations in the WhatsApp legal case.""We stand by our previous statements that NSO Group products cannot be used to conduct cyber-surveillance within the United States, and no customer has ever been granted technology that enables targeting phones with US numbers,"" a spokesman said. Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said the possibility of US-based servers being used to deploy the spyware raised ""more questions than answers"".""They appear to have some sort of infrastructure in the US,"" Prof Woodward said. ""The question is whether the US government is aware of it.""A Facebook spokesperson said: ""NSO Group is responsible for cyber-attacks against human rights activists, journalists, and diplomats, in violation of US law. ""We are committed to protecting the security of our community and are seeking to hold them accountable in court.""NSO said its official stance remained that which it had put forward in the legal case with Facebook.""Revisiting and recycling the conjecture of NSO's detractors... doesn't change the overall truth of our position, which we have stated to the US Federal Court in California,"" it said.""Factual assertions on all the above have been provided as part of the official court record, and we do not have anything else to add at this time.""",21 May 2020,technology
Zack Snyder's Justice League re-cut headed for HBO Max,"HBO Max has announced it will air a re-versioned edition of the superhero film Justice League.The new cut will be done by the film's original director Zack Snyder, who left the production of the film before it was finished due to a family tragedy.Joss Whedon, the director of The Avengers, was brought in to complete the film, but fans complained he made the film too light-hearted. HBO's announcement comes a week before the release its new streaming service.Warner Media, which produced Justice League, is also the parent company of HBO.Competition among streaming services has heated up over the last year as more companies have entered the field.Announcing content with Hollywood A-listers or with popular franchise like the DC Comics or Star Wars has been one way that services have tried to attract subscribers.""These brands come with built in fan bases so there will be eyes on the streaming service based on the brand recognition,"" said Vince Peters, chief executive officer of Inheritance AI. Many fans have been calling for a ""Snyder-cut"" of Justice League since the film was released in 2017.  Synder completed most the filming for the movie based on the DC Comic Book. But he stepped away from the project before post-production and editing work following the suicide of his daughter.Whedon, who created the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, did several reshoots and fans suggested he gave the film a lighter tone than Synder's original intent.On social media, the hashtag #ReleasetheSnyderCut has been used by fans calling for a new version of the film.It is not yet known whether the new version, set to be released in 2021 will be a six-part series or a nearly four-hour long directors-cut film.HBO Max is not the only service looking to big names or familiar franchise to attract subscribers.Earlier this week Apple TV Plus announced it would premier the Tom Hanks' film Greyhound, developed by Sony Pictures. The film was set to have a theatrical release in June, but executives changed course because of concern the coronavirus pandemic would keep viewers away from cinemas. When Disney Plus launched in November, it promoted its new Star Wars series The Mandalorian.Short-form streaming app Quibi spent billions on new programming featuring stars ranging from actress Sophie Turner to Chance the Rapper and celebrity chef Evan Funke.More competition is entering the streaming market as well.

Apple and Google release marks 'watershed moment' for contact-tracing apps,"Apple and Google have released a software tool that will make it possible for nations to release coronavirus contact-tracing apps that adopt the firms' privacy-centric model.It offers developers access to added Bluetooth functionality to solve a problem existing apps have of iPhones sometimes failing to detect each other.Android and iOS device owners will have to carry out system upgrades.But some countries - including the UK - are pursuing a different approach.""The release of these APIs [application programming interfaces] along with the operating-system updates will be a watershed moment for the development and adoption of proximity-tracing apps,"" said Marcel Salathé, an epidemiologist at the Swiss research institute EPFL.He added that apps that adopted the protocol should be able to be made ""interoperable"" - meaning that citizens can continue to be contact-traced as they cross from one region and/or country to another. That could potentially help reduce travel restrictions imposed because of the virus - at least for those using the apps involved.Apple and Google said public health agencies from 22 countries and some US states had already asked to test the system.The app was not ""a silver bullet"" - but ""user adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use"".Contact-tracing apps are designed to automatically log when two people come into proximity to each other for a significant amount of time.If one is later diagnosed with the coronavirus, the other can be given an alert, which might suggest they self-isolate and/or request a medical test of their own.But the authorities believe adoption has been hampered by two factors:In theory, the new system should address both these issues.Its ""decentralised"" approach locates contact-matching on devices themselves rather than a centrally controlled computer server.And this aims to cut the risk of either hackers or the authorities using the database of who met whom and for how long for other purposes.But the UK's NHS and its counterparts in France, Norway and India say the centralised approach gives them greater insight, making it easier to tweak the risk model that decides who receives which type of alert. Apps that adopt Apple and Google's API can customise it within certain limits.But they will not be able to log, for example, a phone's global positioning system (GPS) coordinates.""Not collecting some kinds of data, such as location, is a policy decision, not an engineering one,"" technology consultant Benedict Evans said.""But Apple-Google have to build something for every phone on Earth, [potentially] including China and Iran, and think about how it could be abused. ""How much you need the extra data and whether it's worth the privacy risks is a matter of opinion.""Austria was the first country to roll out a decentralised contact-tracing app.Stopp Corona, operated by the Red Cross, has been downloaded more than 600,000 times.And its developers, Accenture, now intend to build in Apple and Google's API for a 10 June update so iPhone-users no longer have to bring the app on-screen for it to work effectively.But Stopp Corona currently gives users the option of manually controlling when matches occur - by pressing an on-screen button to trigger a Bluetooth ""handshake"" .And this is not currently possible within the Apple-Google model.So the developers plan to switch to using ultrasonic audio pings in this situation.Apple and Google's API is also currently incompatible with the way Stopp Corona triggers different types of notification.The app first serves a yellow alert if a contact self-diagnoses as having the virus and then follows up with a red or green alert depending on whether a medical test confirms it.And the developers are working with Apple and Google to try to retain this functionality.""There's really good collaboration on both sides,"" Christian Winhelhofer, the Accenture executive involved, told BBC News.""They're really interested in working on solutions that fit our needs.""Germany's forthcoming Corona-Warn-App is also set to adopt the Apple-Google protocol.But its developers have complained handsets not in use are limited to listening out for a Bluetooth signal only once every five minutes for a duration of about four seconds.So, in theory, a couple hugging for three minutes, for example, might not be logged, while another merely brushing past each other at the right time would be.Apple and Google are aware of this issue. By contrast, the NHS's app listens out for a match roughly once every eight seconds. The NHS has also developed its own workaround to the iPhone Bluetooth issue.But it is still exploring the Apple-Google system as a back-up plan.",20 May 2020,technology
Man makes money buying his own pizza on DoorDash app,"The owner of a pizza restaurant in the US has discovered the DoorDash delivery app has been selling his food cheaper than he does - while still paying him full price for orders.A pizza for which he charged $24 (£20) was being advertised for $16 on DoorDash - and when he secretly ordered it himself, the app paid his restaurant the full $24 while charging him $16.He had not asked to be put on the app.He later found out it was part of a trial to gauge customer demand.Content strategist Ranjan Roy blogged about the anonymous restaurateur, who is his friend - he later named the business, which has outlets in Manhattan and Topeka, Kansas, US.Mr Roy said he first heard about the situation in March 2019, when his friend started receiving complaints about deliveries, even though his outlets did not deliver.At that point , he discovered he had been added to DoorDash - and noticed it was charging a lower price for one of his premium pizzas.So he ordered 10 pizzas, paid $160 and had them delivered to a friend's house. The restaurant was then paid $240 for the order by DoorDash.The next time, the restaurant prepared his friend's order by boxing up the pizza base without any toppings, maximising the ""profit"" from the mismatched prices.""I was genuinely curious if DoorDash would catch on - but they didn't,"" wrote Mr Roy.DoorDash did not respond to BBC News's request for comment.But Mr Roy said: ""We found out afterward that was all the result of a 'demand test' by DoorDash.""They have a test period where they scrape the restaurant's website and don't charge any fees to anyone, so they can ideally go to the restaurant with positive order data to then get the restaurant signed on to the platform.""Third-party delivery platforms, as they've been built, just seem like the wrong model, but instead of testing, failing, and evolving, they've been subsidised into market dominance.""You have insanely large pools of capital creating an incredibly inefficient money-losing business model.""DoorDash is backed by investment giant Softbank, which this week posted a record-breaking loss of nearly $13bn. Defending the loss, chief executive Masayoshi Son reportedly compared himself to Jesus. The billionaire is said to have stated during a call with investors that Jesus was ""also misunderstood"". He later apologised.",20 May 2020,technology
"Chris Pratt accidentally deleted 51,000 emails","Actor Chris Pratt has shared the moment he accidentally wiped clean his entire email inbox. The Marvel star began sorting through his inbox after telling fans his son, Jack, had teased him for having 35,000 unread messages. Unfortunately, Pratt pressed the wrong button and was forced to watch as 51,000 emails were erased. Pratt shared the moment on Instagram, and fans rushed to poke fun at the incident. ""Yesterday my son was playing with my phone and he gasped in shock looking at the number of unread emails that I have. It's a lot,"" Pratt said.""I'm one of those idiots who will do an IQ test and be like, 'Wanna take an IQ test? Give me your email'. And then I do, which proves my IQ is about seven, I just get junk from everyone and I just don't erase it.""The Guardians of the Galaxy actor said his new goal while taking time off work due to Covid-19 would be to read through 1,000 emails a day.He also made a promise to reply to them all. However, his well-meaning plan fell through when he inexplicably deleted every single message he had ever received.""Fifty-one thousand messages are in the trash,"" Pratt said, adding an expletive as he turned the camera to show the number of emails in his trash slowly decreasing - apparently gone forever.""What did I do? It's just deleting them all. All my email. Oh my God. This could be a real nightmare,"" he added. Fans quickly took to social media to make light of the incident.Many noted similarities between Pratt's mistake and his bumbling character Andy Dwyer from the American version of the sitcom The Office.""Convinced Chris Pratt was not acting when he played Andy Dwyer,"" joked one fan.Pratt finished his own video with a shrug, just saying: ""Fresh start.""",22 May 2020,technology
Australia 'records fastest internet speed ever',"Researchers in Australia claim they have recorded the fastest ever internet data speed.A team from Monash, Swinburne and RMIT universities logged a data speed of 44.2 terabits per second (Tbps). At that speed, users could download more than 1,000 high-definition movies in less than a second. According to Ofcom, the average UK broadband speed currently is around 64 megabits per second (Mbps) - a fraction of that recorded in the recent study.Australia lies in the middle of global rankings for internet speeds, and slow connections are a regular source of complaints from users.Researchers said they achieved the new record speed by using a device that replaces around 80 lasers found in some existing telecoms hardware, with a single piece of equipment known as a 'micro-comb'.The micro-comb was planted into and tested - outside the laboratory - using existing infrastructure, similar to that used by Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN).The result was the highest amount of data ever produced by a single optical chip, which are used in modern fibre-optic broadband systems around the world. The Australian team hope their findings offer a glimpse into how internet connections could look in the future. While the data speed far outstrips any reasonable consumer need in today's world, Bill Corcoran, lecturer in electrical and computer systems at Monash University, said it could ultimately help transform a wide variety of industries  - as modern life continues to put increasing pressure on bandwidth infrastructure. The global lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic has seen the internet infrastructure come under unprecedented strain.""We're currently getting a sneak peek of how the infrastructure for the internet will hold up in two to three years' time, due to the unprecedented number of people using the internet for remote work, socialising and streaming,"" said Mr Corcoran.""What our research demonstrates is the ability for fibres that we already have in the ground... to be the backbone of communications networks now and in the future.""""And it's not just Netflix we're talking about here,"" he added. ""This data can be used for self-driving cars and future transportation, and it can help the medicine, education, finance, and e-commerce industries - as well as enable us to read with our grandchildren from kilometres away.""Professor David Moss, of Swinburne University, described the findings as ""an enormous breakthrough"". ""Micro-combs offer enormous promise for us to meet the world's insatiable demand for bandwidth.""",22 May 2020,technology
Grandmother ordered to delete Facebook photos under GDPR,"A woman must delete photographs of her grandchildren that she posted on Facebook and Pinterest without their parents' permission, a court in the Netherlands has ruled.It ended up in court after a falling-out between the woman and her daughter.The judge ruled the matter was within the scope of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).One expert said the ruling reflected the ""position that the European Court has taken over many years"".The case went to court after the woman refused to delete photographs of her grandchildren which she had posted on social media.The mother of the children had asked several times for the pictures to be deleted.The GDPR does not apply to the ""purely personal"" or ""household"" processing of data.However, that exemption did not apply because posting photographs on social media made them available to a wider audience, the ruling said.""With Facebook, it cannot be ruled out that placed photos may be distributed and may end up in the hands of third parties,"" it said.The woman must remove the photos or pay a fine of €50 (£45) for every day that she fails to comply with the order, up to a maximum fine of €1,000.If she posts more images of the children in the future, she will be fined an extra €50 a day.""I think the ruling will surprise a lot of people who probably don't think too much before they tweet or post photos,"" said Neil Brown, a technology lawyer at Decoded Legal.""Irrespective of the legal position, would it be reasonable for the people who've posted those photos to think, 'Well, he or she doesn't want them out there anymore'?"" ""Actually, the reasonable thing - the human thing to do - is to go and take them down.""",21 May 2020,technology
