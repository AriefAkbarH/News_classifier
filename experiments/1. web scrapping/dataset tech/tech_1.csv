Coronavirus: German contact-tracing app takes different path to NHS,"Germany's forthcoming coronavirus contact-tracing app will trigger alerts only if users test positive for Covid-19.That puts it at odds with the NHS app, which instead relies on users self-diagnosing via an on-screen questionnaire.UK health chiefs have said the questionnaire is a key reason they are pursuing a ""centralised"" design despite privacy campaigners' protests.Germany ditched that model in April.And on Wednesday Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be a ""much higher level of acceptance"" for a decentralised approach, which is designed to offer a higher degree of anonymity.Automated contact tracing uses smartphones to register when their owners are in close proximity for significant amounts of time.If someone is later found to have the virus, a warning can be sent to others they may have infected, telling them to get tested themselves and possibly go into quarantine.In the centralised model, the contact-matching happens on a remote computer server. And the UK's National Cyber Security Centre has said this will enable it to catch attackers trying to abuse the self-diagnosis system.By contrast, the decentralised version carries out the process on the phones themselves. And there is no central database that could be used to re-identify individuals and reveal with whom they had had spent time.BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said: ""The NHS is taking a big gamble in choosing to alert app users when they have been in contact with someone who has merely reported symptoms.""It could make the app fast and effective - or it could mean users become exasperated by a blizzard of false alarms.""Ms Merkel said SAP and Deutsche Telekom - which are co-developing Germany's app - were waiting for Google and Apple to release a software interface before they could complete their work.And BBC News has learned the two US technology companies plan to release the finished version of their API (application programming interface) as soon as Thursday.Details of Germany's Corona-Warn-App published on the code-sharing site Github say it depends solely on medical test results to ""avoid misuse"".Those who test positive will be given a verification code that must be entered into the app before it anonymously flags them as being a risk to others.Germany has led the way in testing in Europe and currently has capacity to analyse about 838,000 samples per week. The UK is catching up - but scientists advising the NHS say they can save more lives by also drawing on self-diagnosis data.""Speed is of the essence,"" Prof Christophe Fraser, of the Oxford Big Data Institute, said last week.It can take several days to obtain Covid-19 test results.And self-reported symptoms can be acted on instantly.But an ethics advisory board advising Health Secretary Matt Hancock on the app has warned too many resulting ""false positive alerts could undermine trust in the app and cause undue stress to users"".The NHS is currently trialling its app on the Isle of Wight.There have been reports of some suspected false alerts.But a Department of Health spokeswoman said this had been expected.""In a matter of days, more than 50,000 people have downloaded the app with overwhelmingly positive feedback,"" she told BBC News.""But as with all new technologies, there will be issues that need to be resolved in how it works, which is why it is being trialled before a national rollout.""The NHS is also exploring use of the Apple-Google API, which would entail a switch to the decentralised model.But it intends to offer users the centralised version first, unless plans to complete the rollout within a fortnight go awry.One sticking point could be calls for limits on how the data is used - possibly requiring a new law.That would avoid the risk of a repeat of the situation in Norway, where the local data protection watchdog has accused the country's health authority of failing to carry out a proper risk assessment of a centralised contact-tracing app.",13 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus contact-tracing: World split between two types of app,"Countries around the world are developing Covid-19 smartphone apps to limit the spread of coronavirus and relax lockdown restrictions. It's hoped the information they gather can be used to alert people whether they pose a risk of spreading the contagion, and need to isolate. But, over recent weeks, a split has emerged between two different types of app - the so-called centralised and decentralised versions.Both types use Bluetooth signals to log when smartphone owners are close to each other - so if someone develops Covid-19 symptoms, an alert can be sent to other users they may have infected.Under the centralised model, the anonymised data gathered is uploaded to a remote server where matches are made with other contacts, should a person start to develop Covid-19 symptoms.This is the method the UK is pursuing. By contrast, the decentralised model gives users more control over their information by keeping it on the phone. It is there that matches are made with people who may have contracted the virus. This is the model promoted by Google, Apple and an international consortium.Both sides have their fans. Backers of the centralised model say it can give the authorities more insight into the spread of the virus and how well the app is performing. Supporters of the decentralised approach say it offers users a higher degree of privacy, protecting them from hackers or the state itself revealing their social contacts.In truth, both are unproven at this stage. South Korea, seen as one of the most successful countries at tackling Covid-19, has done it without a contact-tracing app. It has however used other surveillance methods which would be seen as invasive by many.At the start, the centralised approach was seen to be pioneering. Singapore's TraceTogether was widely viewed as the one to emulate. But that changed after it emerged the app was only being used by about 20% of the local population, and there had been a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.Part of the problem is that TraceTogether does not work properly when in the background on iPhones because of the way Apple restricts use of Bluetooth. The firm has promised to waive these curbs, but only if apps fall into line with its decentralised system. Singapore has since signalled it will do so as a result.""We are working with Apple and Google to make the app more effective, especially for iOS users,"" a spokesman told the BBC.Australia, another early adopter of the centralised approach, launched its CovidSafe app based on TraceTogether, and faced similar issues as a consequence. It has said it plans to adopt the Apple-Google framework, citing a ""big shift in performance of Bluetooth connectivity"". And on Wednesday, Colombia confirmed it too was considering a switch after having to turn off the contact-tracing feature in its CoronApp.""[We need to] minimise the risk of generating unnecessary alerts,"" said presidential advisor Victor Munoz.Others, though, are still forging ahead with the centralised approach. France's digital minister has said it intends to launch its StopCovid app by 2 June, and is attempting to press Apple into a U-turn of its own.""Apple could have helped us make the application work even better on the iPhone,"" said digital minister Cédric O on Tuesday. ""They have wished not to do so. I regret this.""But he faces internal resistance from one of the government's own human rights bodies, which has described the design as being ""dangerous"" and warned it may try to block its adoption.Norway has already adopted a centralised design for its Smittestopp app, which went live last month in three municipalities. In addition to Bluetooth readings, it also collects GPS location data.The developer claims that the combination of the two leads to ""very accurate contact tracing results without the need for [the Google-Apple interface"".But this has raised privacy concerns, which may have contributed to a fairly high drop-out rate. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said that as of 28 April, 1.5 million people had downloaded the app, but only 899,142 were actively using it - representing just 20.5% of over-16s in the test zones.India's contact-tracing app, Aaroya Setu, takes a similar approach to Norway's. To tackle adoption, the government has ruled all government and private sector workers must use it.Until Apple and Google release their interface, known as an API, it's impossible to be sure their system will be any more successful. But the list of nations flocking to it keeps growing. Germany surprised many when it confirmed it had been convinced decentralisation was the way to go - it had previously seemed set to go hand-in-hand with France.Poland's forthcoming app may also be about to abandon its centralised plan before launch.""We assume that adapting ProteGo Safe to Google and Apple APIs will be necessary,"" developers' notes read. ""We assume that adapting… to Google and Apple APIs will be necessary.""Italy's Immuni announced it too was backing the US tech giants' initiative on 29 April, praising its stronger guarantee of anonymity. Other countries set to do likewise include:Luxembourg's MPs are about to vote on a decentralised approach. And the BBC has also been told Greece is about to adopt a similar position.Why does all this matter? There may be problems trying to make the two different types of system talk to each other.""The core reason is that centralised systems ask you to upload the people you have seen, and decentralised systems don't need that data, so they don't play well together,"" explained Dr Michael Veale of the DP3T group, which supports a similar system to Apple and Google.""So if you see an app as an important part of reducing lockdown, then you remove the ability to trace the virus as it crosses borders, and viruses don't respect borders.""",7 May 2020,technology

Inflatable e-scooter that fits in backpack unveiled,"An inflatable e-scooter compact enough to be stored inside a commuter's backpack has been unveiled in Japan. The Poimo, developed by the University of Tokyo, can be inflated in just over a minute, using an electric pump. The creators said they wanted to create a vehicle that minimised the potential for injury in the event of an accident. However, experts say e-scooter rules still need to be clarified by the government before such modes of transport can be considered safe. The Poimo has five solid, detachable components:It is made primarily out of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), which is already used to make products such as airbeds. The vehicle weighs about 5.5kg (12lb) in total.But researchers hope to reduce this for subsequent prototypes. ""We believe that our inflatable mobility, which is different from existing mobility systems and creates new relationships with people, will be useful for the city in the future,"" said Ryuma Niiyama, part of the development team at the University of Tokyo.Californian company Bird launched a pilot service in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in 2018.But e-scooters are currently banned on UK roads. That could change next month, though, following an urgent government review of the legislation.Ollie Chadwhick, managing director at e-scooter-maker Electra-Zoom, said: ""We have written to the Transport Minister, Grant Shapps, asking him to expedite this legislation, so that people can revolutionise the way they travel, in tandem with the return to work and the arrival of summer, without the risks of overcrowded public transport or reliance on cars.""Media manager Sam Jones told BBC News: “Cycling UK believes they should be legalised but cautiously, keeping them off pavements and carefully limiting the maximum speed and power of their electric motors,"" Mr Jones . ""Cautious legislation can be relaxed if this proves to be justified. ""However, we can’t do the opposite and restrict faster or higher-powered e-scooters once people are already using them.""

UK average broadband speeds up despite lockdown wobble,"The average broadband speed in the UK rose by 18% last year, regulator Ofcom says.The annual home broadband report says the average home speed is now 64 megabits per second (Mbps), up from 54.2Mbps the year before.The 18% boost is in line with growth in previous years.Data for the report was gathered in November 2019, but updated with changes during the coronavirus lockdown, when speeds fell by 2%.Ofcom says the small decrease shows that performance ""is holding up well"" during the pandemic, despite the increased demand.The government began to ask people to stay at home on 16 March, so the speeds from the last week of March were compared to the beginning of the month.Virgin Media was the worst affected, with speed dipping by nearly 10% at one point - although the report noted that since Virgin has higher speeds than most providers, customers were unlikely to have noticed.The Ofcom report is compiled from a panel of volunteers who have the speeds measured from their routers, and is considered to be a very accurate way of measuring the data.The main body of the report, which covers the data from 2019, found that nearly three-quarters of UK homes have what Ofcom considers ""superfast"" broadband packages of 30Mpbs or higher.Real-world connection speeds are slightly lower, with 69% of people achieving 30Mbps or more. That includes the 17% of homes on 100Mbps or higher, and 3% achieve more than 300Mbps. On the lower end, 13% of homes are still on connections of 10mbps or less, and another 18% have speeds between 10-30mbps.Real-world speeds measured at router, %Those numbers all refer to the proportion of people who are actually getting those speeds - not how widely available they are. The speeds and packages available to homes still depend on their physical address. Rural broadband, for example, broadly remains slower than the same technology in urban areas. Old-style ADSL (Asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections over copper wire, for example, are 36% higher in cities than outside them. But the gap between rural and urban connections is narrowing, the report found.Ofcom also launched a separate report on the same day on broadband availability - what is offered to homes, rather than what speeds are actually achieved.Full-fibre broadband is up by a fifth since last year, but is still only accessible to 12% of homes. Ultrafast broadband availability (300mpbs or higher) crept upward by 2% to 55% of households.",13 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Cyber-attacks hit hospital construction companies,"Two companies involved in building emergency coronavirus hospitals have been hit by cyber-attacks this month.Interserve, which helped build Birmingham's NHS Nightingale hospital, and Bam Construct, which delivered the Yorkshire and the Humber's, have reported the incidents to authorities. Earlier this month, the government warned healthcare groups involved in the response to the virus were being targeted by malicious actors.The separate attacks were not linked.But Bam Construct said the ""significant"" cyber-attack on it ""forms part of the wave of attacks on public and private organisations supporting the national effort on Covid-19"".A spokesman said the company had shut down its website and some other systems as a precaution, after being hit by a computer virus.But its day-to-day business had remained largely unaffected. ""Our own precautions have had more of an effect on our normal working procedures than the virus itself,"" he said.Interserve, meanwhile, said ""some operational services may be affected"".But it was working with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to ""contain and remedy the situation"" and had notified the Information Commissioner's Office and warned its employees, former employees, clients and suppliers to ""exercise heightened vigilance during this time"".The outsourcing company also provides facilities management and other services and holds a range of contracts with the government beyond the construction sector.Earlier this month, the NCSC warned of attempts to attack healthcare and research organisations during the pandemic.And the government warned malicious actors were ""seeking to undermine the global response to this unprecedented global health crisis endanger lives"".",13 May 2020,technology

Coronavirus contact-tracing: World split between two types of app,"Countries around the world are developing Covid-19 smartphone apps to limit the spread of coronavirus and relax lockdown restrictions. It's hoped the information they gather can be used to alert people whether they pose a risk of spreading the contagion, and need to isolate. But, over recent weeks, a split has emerged between two different types of app - the so-called centralised and decentralised versions.Both types use Bluetooth signals to log when smartphone owners are close to each other - so if someone develops Covid-19 symptoms, an alert can be sent to other users they may have infected.Under the centralised model, the anonymised data gathered is uploaded to a remote server where matches are made with other contacts, should a person start to develop Covid-19 symptoms.This is the method the UK is pursuing. By contrast, the decentralised model gives users more control over their information by keeping it on the phone. It is there that matches are made with people who may have contracted the virus. This is the model promoted by Google, Apple and an international consortium.Both sides have their fans.

Inflatable e-scooter that fits in backpack unveiled,"An inflatable e-scooter compact enough to be stored inside a commuter's backpack has been unveiled in Japan. The Poimo, developed by the University of Tokyo, can be inflated in just over a minute, using an electric pump. The creators said they wanted to create a vehicle that minimised the potential for injury in the event of an accident. However, experts say e-scooter rules still need to be clarified by the government before such modes of transport can be considered safe. The Poimo has five solid, detachable components:It is made primarily out of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), which is already used to make products such as airbeds. The vehicle weighs about 5.5kg (12lb) in total.But researchers hope to reduce this for subsequent prototypes. ""We believe that our inflatable mobility, which is different from existing mobility systems and creates new relationships with people, will be useful for the city in the future,"" said Ryuma Niiyama, part of the development team at the University of Tokyo.Californian company Bird launched a pilot service in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in 2018.But e-scooters are currently banned on UK roads. That could change next month, though, following an urgent government review of the legislation.Ollie Chadwhick, managing director at e-scooter-maker Electra-Zoom, said: ""We have written to the Transport Minister, Grant Shapps, asking him to expedite this legislation, so that people can revolutionise the way they travel, in tandem with the return to work and the arrival of summer, without the risks of overcrowded public transport or reliance on cars.""Media manager Sam Jones told BBC News: “Cycling UK believes they should be legalised but cautiously, keeping them off pavements and carefully limiting the maximum speed and power of their electric motors,"" Mr Jones .

UK average broadband speeds up despite lockdown wobble,"The average broadband speed in the UK rose by 18% last year, regulator Ofcom says.The annual home broadband report says the average home speed is now 64 megabits per second (Mbps), up from 54.2Mbps the year before.The 18% boost is in line with growth in previous years.Data for the report was gathered in November 2019, but updated with changes during the coronavirus lockdown, when speeds fell by 2%.Ofcom says the small decrease shows that performance ""is holding up well"" during the pandemic, despite the increased demand.The government began to ask people to stay at home on 16 March, so the speeds from the last week of March were compared to the beginning of the month.Virgin Media was the worst affected, with speed dipping by nearly 10% at one point - although the report noted that since Virgin has higher speeds than most providers, customers were unlikely to have noticed.The Ofcom report is compiled from a panel of volunteers who have the speeds measured from their routers, and is considered to be a very accurate way of measuring the data.The main body of the report, which covers the data from 2019, found that nearly three-quarters of UK homes have what Ofcom considers ""superfast"" broadband packages of 30Mpbs or higher.Real-world connection speeds are slightly lower, with 69% of people achieving 30Mbps or more. That includes the 17% of homes on 100Mbps or higher, and 3% achieve more than 300Mbps. On the lower end, 13% of homes are still on connections of 10mbps or less, and another 18% have speeds between 10-30mbps.Real-world speeds measured at router, %Those numbers all refer to the proportion of people who are actually getting those speeds - not how widely available they are. The speeds and packages available to homes still depend on their physical address. Rural broadband, for example, broadly remains slower than the same technology in urban areas. Old-style ADSL (Asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections over copper wire, for example, are 36% higher in cities than outside them. But the gap between rural and urban connections is narrowing, the report found.Ofcom also launched a separate report on the same day on broadband availability - what is offered to homes, rather than what speeds are actually achieved.Full-fibre broadband is up by a fifth since last year, but is still only accessible to 12% of homes. Ultrafast broadband availability (300mpbs or higher) crept upward by 2% to 55% of households.",13 May 2020,technology

Google Search results topped by suspected scam gadget store,"A suspected scam store, featuring hard-to-find gadgets priced below the norm, topped Google search results for days.MyTechDomestic accepted payments via direct bank transfers only - despite indicating support for credit cards and PayPal - and falsely claimed to be owned by a UK-registered company.It was flagged to Google last week but the US company took action only after being contacted by BBC News on Monday.The site's operator did not respond to several requests for comment.However, the platform went offline shortly after BBC News asked for a response to customers' claims it amounted to a ""scam"".Action Fraud - the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber-crime - is looking into the matter after receiving a complaint from a member of the public.""Given the large numbers of people who view these adverts, Google should move much more quickly in response to reports of scams, and be proactive about vetting them to help prevent people losing money to fraudsters,"" Which? Computing editor Kate Bevan said.MyTechDomestic's website was registered with a Canadian domain registrar on 19 April.It was subsequently promoted via ads bought from Google's Shopping service, meaning its listings featured a ""By Google"" tag when they appeared within its search results.By late last week, the site was top billed for several gadgets sold out or priced at a premium elsewhere. These ads appeared at the top of Google's mobile search results and to the side of some desktop searches.The products included:The store often indicated it had relatively low supplies left in stock and frequently priced products at an 18% discount.And although its pages featured logos for American Express, Mastercard and PayPal, at point-of-sale it allowed customers to pay via a bank transfer only.Initially, it listed a Paris-based account. But after one user drew attention to this being unusual, on a post to MoneySavingExpert.com's forum, the site switched to using an English bank.MyTechDomestic stated it was operated by a London-based corporation, for which it provided an address and registration number.But that company turned out to be a seven-year-old business consultancy with similar initials, which denied involvement.""MyTechDomestic is nothing whatsoever to do with MTDO Ltd,"" a spokesman said.""We don't sell anything on the internet and we were shocked that it was that easy to set up something that steals someone else's company's identity.""MTDO said it had reported the issue to Google on Friday, 8 May, via its Report Phishing tool.However, the adverts remained online until Monday evening. After being contacted by BBC News, Google began its own investigation. It concluded the site had violated its ""misrepresentation policy"" and should have been dealt with more quickly.""We take dishonest business practices very seriously and consider them to be an egregious violation of our policies,"" a spokeswoman said.""We have a tool where anyone can report these ads and these complaints are reviewed manually by our team. ""In 2019, we removed 2.7 billion bad ads and we're constantly updating our policies as we see new threats emerge.""The site's registrar, PlanetHoster, confirmed it had also taken action of its own.""Currently, the website mytechdomestic.com is suspended for a violation of our policy,"" it said in a statement.""Unfortunately, we cannot share more information about this case without an official warrant.""Meanwhile, several of the site's users voiced concerns they may have been ""scammed"" out of hundreds of pounds, in complaints posted to TrustPilot's review site.""[An] investigation is currently ongoing with my bank and the Action Fraud police,"" one, who had paid £311.59 for a treadmill, told BBC News.One cyber-security expert said consumers should be ""wary"" of listings from unfamiliar names - even if they were promoted by Google.""Having been warned of a suspicious site, Google could easily have confirmed that the site was less than a month old and asking for payment in a way which doesn't protect consumers,"" Graham Cluley said.""At the very least, it should have suspended the shopping lists while it investigated the domain.""",12 May 2020,technology
Australia wins AI 'Eurovision Song Contest',"An Australian team has won a competition to write a hit Eurovision song using artificial intelligence.An editor for Dutch broadcaster VPRO had the idea, after the Netherlands won last year's Eurovision Song Contest.And it grew into an international effort after this year's contest was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic.The winning song, Beautiful the World, was inspired by nature's recovery from the bushfires earlier this year.A total of 13 teams took part, from the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Belgium, the UK, France, Germany and Switzerland. The Australian team, called Uncanny Valley in a nod to how humans and robots may one day merge, was made up of maths, computer-science and social-anthropology students, as well as music producers.The melody and lyrics were written by an AI system, trained with audio samples of koalas, kookaburras and tasmanian devils. The public voted overwhelmingly for the song.A panel of AI experts, Vincent Koops, Anna Huang and Ed Newton-Rex, also rated it highly but gave the full ""douze points"" to the German team, Dadabots x Portrait XO.The panel were ""amazed by the wide range of innovative approaches to using AI to create music"".""Composing a song with AI is hard because you have all the creative challenges that come with song-writing, but you also have to juggle getting the machine learning right,"" they said.""The teams not only pushed the boundaries of their personal creativity, but also gave the audience a look into the exciting future of human-AI musical collaboration.""Senior editor at VPRO Karen van Dijk, who came up with the idea for the contest, said all the teams had made the most out of the creative possibilities of artificial intelligence.""In my opinion, some songs would not be out of place in the official Eurovision Song Contest.""Details about the teams are available on the VPRO website and there is a livestream of the competition on YouTube.",12 May 2020,technology
Scrabble fans slam 'sparkly abomination' new app,"Scrabble Go, a new game which will replace the existing official Scrabble mobile app made by Electronic Arts (EA) has sparked hundreds of complaints.Its vivid colours, treasure-style rewards and in-app purchase model has angered long-time players.The EA game will be discontinued on 5 June because the official franchise is now licensed to Scopely. Scrabble Go was launched on 5 March and had been downloaded more than 10 million times by the end of April.At that time, it had 2.5 million daily players, who spent an average of 100 minutes of game time per day, Reuters reported.It has a four-star rating on the Google Play store, but also hundreds of recent negative comments, with many complaining that the design is too distracting.A digital petition on the website Change.org calling for EA to keep the original app going has nearly 1,200 signatures.""I don't want jewels, cartoons, or potential dates. I want to play Scrabble against my friends and family. That's it. Nothing else,"" wrote one signatory.""They've turned it into some sparkly Candy Crush abomination,"" Ian Pym from Fareham, Hampshire, told the BBC. ""I defy any adult to play it for longer than 10 minutes and not feel physically sick.""Ian's mother, Christiane, 78, is an avid Scrabble player and has clocked up 21,000 games on the EA app.""It's not even worth sharing Scrabble Go with my mum - she would be totally confused,"" he said.Mrs Pym said she played the EA game for relaxation.""When I heard they were going to stop it I thought it was the end of my life, it's so relaxing for me,"" she said.""I think it will be a shame for a lot of people, especially those who are on their own."" There are alternative apps to the official game such as Words with Friends and Wordmaster, which have similar rules to traditional Scrabble, but are not licensed by its owners. The BBC contacted Scopely, but was directed to its customer services team, which said: ""The players' point of view is always important, that's why any suggestion or feedback will be more than welcome.""EA released a statement in March explaining its plan to discontinue its version of the game, which had been licensed by Scrabble owners Hasbro and Mattel since 2008.""Our games have built a passionate community and we want to thank you for playing for so many years,"" the games giant said.EA players will be unable to migrate their profiles and data to Scrabble Go, but they will be able to connect with friends.",12 May 2020,technology

There may be problems trying to make the two different types of system talk to each other.""The core reason is that centralised systems ask you to upload the people you have seen, and decentralised systems don't need that data, so they don't play well together,"" explained Dr Michael Veale of the DP3T group, which supports a similar system to Apple and Google.""So if you see an app as an important part of reducing lockdown, then you remove the ability to trace the virus as it crosses borders, and viruses don't respect borders.""",7 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Will offices be safe for a return to work?,"As lockdowns start to ease in many countries, so the tentative return to work begins, leaving people understandably concerned about how safe a space an office will be in the middle of a global pandemic.Alongside some mouldy old food in the communal fridges, there is likely to be an increase in the amount of technology used to monitor employees.From thermal cameras taking your temperature when you enter the building to apps or wearables to alert you if you get too close to colleagues, work could soon have the feel of the Minority Report movie.The Edge in Amsterdam was voted one of the smartest and most sustainable buildings in the world a few years ago, and it is adapting its sensor-packed offices to the new reality of living with a contagious and potentially life-threatening virus.Coen van Oostrom, the founder of the real-estate firm that built it, told the BBC that there are a couple of ""no brainer"" changes that can happen immediately.""The doors can currently be opened by hand but it is a small step to be able to open them by voice control or via an app, and we want to do that to make sure the virus isn't spreading that way.""We also have cameras that can see how many people are on a floor and with a software update they are also able to measure how far people are away from each other, and we can send a warning to people's phones if they are too close to each other.""Not everyone likes it and there is a feeling that it is an intrusion on their privacy, so we haven't decided yet if we want to use it when everyone is back in the office.""The Edge, unlike most buildings, already provides employees with a phone app that allows them to see what temperature the office is and what air quality is like, as well as allowing them to order their lunch from the canteen.Take-up hasn't been huge. While in the past no one really cared about air quality, now that the chances of the virus spreading are higher if not enough fresh air is circulating, people might start taking notice of it, thinks Mr van Oostrom.Seating plans will also have to change to make sure social distancing rules can be enforced but Susan Clarke, a smart buildings expert with research firm Verdantix, thinks employers are unlikely to radically alter their working practices.""Hot-desking will remain and given the recession we are moving into right now, most firms won't be able to take on more space - but it might be re-thought, so as one person checks out of a desk, a work order is assigned to that area so a cleaner can do some disinfecting.""Some lighting firms, such as Vital Vio, are offering what they describe as safe disinfection lighting, which uses violet light mixed with white light to kill some bacteria on surfaces. While these might have a use in hotels or very high occupancy offices, the expense may not be justifiable to many businesses, thinks Ms Clarke.Flir Technology has been making thermal cameras for use in airports and on board police helicopters for years, but has seen exponential growth in the last few months.Now the firm is seeing interest from factories and businesses.""Basically, every industry that needs to protect its workers and its customers,"" said Flir's vice president of marketing for Flir, Ezra Merrill.The cameras measure a five millimetre square area near the tear duct, which has been judged the best place to record skin temperature. Users wearing spectacles have to remove them.Its algorithms take account of a range of factors, such as time of day, whether it is sunny or raining, as well as the fact that people have a range of normal body temperature.But the device is just one part of the puzzle, and a second step would be to take a person's temperature using a medical grade thermometer, said Mr Merrill.The technology was recently tested at a US factory, where reaction from employees was mixed.""It was a full range as you'd expect, from people who were excited and happy to do it to those who thought they were getting a retina scan.""In fact the camera does not take a picture at all and it is not possible to identify people from the image, but Mr Merrill acknowledges there could be privacy issues. And in some places it could be illegal.""Some countries prohibit employee health monitoring. In Italy for example there are laws stating that you can't monitor health, and that includes parameters such as temperature,"" said Ms Clarke.Lawyer Ravi Naik said businesses have to be careful they are not using ""tech for tech's sake"".""Is this to facilitate an understanding of who can work and who can't, and if not what is the significance of it? Because it is such an interference with basic human rights that there has to be a high level of evidential justification to deploy this tech, and I just don't think that is the case right now.""The radical, long-term solution might involve not having to go into a building at all.Barclays Bank's chief executive Jes Staley has said that having thousands of workers in big expensive city offices ""may be a thing of the past"" as the home-working lockdown era proves many can do their jobs perfectly well at home.As a real estate developer, Mr van Oostrom obviously disagrees.He thinks we will see a hybrid model with more people working from home and employers having ""to seduce people to come into the office"". ""Making offices fun places to be will be more important than ever,"" he said.",7 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: How will you commute to work after lockdown?,"The traditional commute may never be the same again once people return to work after lockdown in what is likely to be an era of social distancing.It's a particularly big problem for workers in the UK's largest cities.One recent report warned that maintaining a 2m (6ft 6in) distance between Tube passengers in London, for example, would reduce its capacity to 15% of normal levels, and buses to 12%.But if more people take to the streets, will the road network cope?""If in big cities we are to have a radical shift to bicycles, scooters, other ways of getting about, that would require a sudden and radical change in road use,"" said Prof Tony Travers from the London School of Economics.""You have to move people quickly through streets and the easiest place to do that is main roads. But they are used by buses, taxis, delivery vehicles and other essential vehicles. Changing road use doesn't happen quickly.""The use of public transport would also need to be staggered, with ""rush hour peaks"" lasting perhaps for five-hour stretches, and spaces being allocated, Prof Travers suggested.Previous experience suggests this would not be an easy change to bring about.""Public transport operators have spent decades trying to get users to spread the rush hour,"" he said. ""It would be hard to do this voluntarily. You would have to have some degree of people, in effect, being allocated slots.""It would also have knock-on consequences for other aspects of daily life.""Will cafes, bars and restaurants need relaxed licensing laws so they can be open for longer? How about parents with children who need to collect them from school?"" he said.""It has profound implications for how businesses work.""So - what is the best alternative?They're largely banned on UK public roads and pavements, but e-scooter sales have doubled year-on-year for Somerset-based retailer Pure Electric.It sold 135 e-scooters in a single day last week, and 11,500 last year.""Electrification is coming - it's a low cost, low impact transport,"" says chief executive Adam Norris. His firm also sells e-bikes.Mr Norris's UK-wide best-selling e-scooter is the M365 from Chinese budget brand Xiaomi. They have a speed cap of 15km/h (10mph) and he suggests they're ideal for journeys of around two to four miles, with e-bikes taking a slightly longer haul.E-scooters are a common sight in many cities around the world including Paris and LA but officially in the UK they are only allowed on private land.The government was planning a public consultation prior to the pandemic but campaigners have long warned of the dangers to both pedestrians and riders. In 2019 TV presenter Emily Hartridge, 35, was riding an electric scooter when she was killed in a collision with a lorry in south London. However, Mr Norris thinks a change in the law is ""logical"" following the rise in consumer demand, and he believes that with sensible precautions such as high-vis clothing and newer models with larger wheels to tackle potholes, safety can be improved.""Safety is important,"" he said. ""But if they limit all e-scooters to the same speed as electric bikes, what's the difference?""Analyst Carolina Milanesi, from Creative Futures, thinks even with the right legislation in place, people may be less likely to want to hire electric vehicles, a service offered by firms like Lime and Bird.""I am not sure if e-bikes and scooters are necessarily the way people will go unless they invest in them themselves, rather than using hire services which would require them to clean them when they get them,"" she said.Anthony Eskinazi runs the platform Just Park, which lets people offer their parking spaces up for rent. He says the firm is considering turning its own 300 car parks into storage for scooters and bikes.He believes ""the balance between congestion and convenience"" may mean car owners won't want to use individual vehicles for very long once traffic builds up.""I think parking demand will surge after lockdown but it won't be sustainable,"" he said.""People want a real alternative now. If the government can facilitate it we will see a boom in micro-mobility.""By its own admission, lockdown has proved to be a challenging time for Uber, which says it is now ""preparing for the next phase of recovery"". It is supplying PPE gloves and masks to all its drivers and is considering calls to pay them a small fee if they take time out between passengers to clean their vehicle interiors. ""I do wonder what the impact on Lyft and Uber will be,"" said Carolina Milanesi. ""What will these companies have to disclose to grow trust that the driver or the passenger is safe?""Uber might adapt a newly launched driver ID tool to ask drivers to upload selfies to prove they are wearing masks at work, it said.The firm is also developing its own driverless car - but it was only allowed back on the roads in California two months ago following a fatal crash in 2018.If all else fails, how about a flying taxi?You might have problems hailing one. There are 175 drone taxi designs floating around (sorry) but as yet no regular service in any one country.""I have been watching empty buses drive past for the last few weeks, and every time I think of how great it would be to provide small-scale public transport with robot taxis,"" says Dr Steve Wright, associate professor in aerospace engineering at the University of the West of England. ""I really want these taxis to be flying ones too, but I think I am going to have to wait, as the coronavirus is probably going to hinder the Evtol [vertical take off and landing] revolution more than encourage it. ""The meltdown going on in the airlines is probably going to drag down the whole aviation industry.""",5 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: German contact-tracing app takes different path to NHS,"Germany's forthcoming coronavirus contact-tracing app will trigger alerts only if users test positive for Covid-19.That puts it at odds with the NHS app, which instead relies on users self-diagnosing via an on-screen questionnaire.UK health chiefs have said the questionnaire is a key reason they are pursuing a ""centralised"" design despite privacy campaigners' protests.Germany ditched that model in April.And on Wednesday Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be a ""much higher level of acceptance"" for a decentralised approach, which is designed to offer a higher degree of anonymity.Automated contact tracing uses smartphones to register when their owners are in close proximity for significant amounts of time.If someone is later found to have the virus, a warning can be sent to others they may have infected, telling them to get tested themselves and possibly go into quarantine.In the centralised model, the contact-matching happens on a remote computer server. And the UK's National Cyber Security Centre has said this will enable it to catch attackers trying to abuse the self-diagnosis system.By contrast, the decentralised version carries out the process on the phones themselves. And there is no central database that could be used to re-identify individuals and reveal with whom they had had spent time.BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said: ""The NHS is taking a big gamble in choosing to alert app users when they have been in contact with someone who has merely reported symptoms.""It could make the app fast and effective - or it could mean users become exasperated by a blizzard of false alarms.""Ms Merkel said SAP and Deutsche Telekom - which are co-developing Germany's app - were waiting for Google and Apple to release a software interface before they could complete their work.And BBC News has learned the two US technology companies plan to release the finished version of their API (application programming interface) as soon as Thursday.Details of Germany's Corona-Warn-App published on the code-sharing site Github say it depends solely on medical test results to ""avoid misuse"".Those who test positive will be given a verification code that must be entered into the app before it anonymously flags them as being a risk to others.Germany has led the way in testing in Europe and currently has capacity to analyse about 838,000 samples per week. The UK is catching up - but scientists advising the NHS say they can save more lives by also drawing on self-diagnosis data.""Speed is of the essence,"" Prof Christophe Fraser, of the Oxford Big Data Institute, said last week.It can take several days to obtain Covid-19 test results.And self-reported symptoms can be acted on instantly.But an ethics advisory board advising Health Secretary Matt Hancock on the app has warned too many resulting ""false positive alerts could undermine trust in the app and cause undue stress to users"".The NHS is currently trialling its app on the Isle of Wight.There have been reports of some suspected false alerts.But a Department of Health spokeswoman said this had been expected.""In a matter of days, more than 50,000 people have downloaded the app with overwhelmingly positive feedback,"" she told BBC News.""But as with all new technologies, there will be issues that need to be resolved in how it works, which is why it is being trialled before a national rollout.""The NHS is also exploring use of the Apple-Google API, which would entail a switch to the decentralised model.But it intends to offer users the centralised version first, unless plans to complete the rollout within a fortnight go awry.One sticking point could be calls for limits on how the data is used - possibly requiring a new law.That would avoid the risk of a repeat of the situation in Norway, where the local data protection watchdog has accused the country's health authority of failing to carry out a proper risk assessment of a centralised contact-tracing app.",13 May 2020,technology
UK average broadband speeds up despite lockdown wobble,"The average broadband speed in the UK rose by 18% last year, regulator Ofcom says.The annual home broadband report says the average home speed is now 64 megabits per second (Mbps), up from 54.2Mbps the year before.The 18% boost is in line with growth in previous years.Data for the report was gathered in November 2019, but updated with changes during the coronavirus lockdown, when speeds fell by 2%.Ofcom says the small decrease shows that performance ""is holding up well"" during the pandemic, despite the increased demand.The government began to ask people to stay at home on 16 March, so the speeds from the last week of March were compared to the beginning of the month.Virgin Media was the worst affected, with speed dipping by nearly 10% at one point - although the report noted that since Virgin has higher speeds than most providers, customers were unlikely to have noticed.The Ofcom report is compiled from a panel of volunteers who have the speeds measured from their routers, and is considered to be a very accurate way of measuring the data.The main body of the report, which covers the data from 2019, found that nearly three-quarters of UK homes have what Ofcom considers ""superfast"" broadband packages of 30Mpbs or higher.Real-world connection speeds are slightly lower, with 69% of people achieving 30Mbps or more. That includes the 17% of homes on 100Mbps or higher, and 3% achieve more than 300Mbps. On the lower end, 13% of homes are still on connections of 10mbps or less, and another 18% have speeds between 10-30mbps.Real-world speeds measured at router, %Those numbers all refer to the proportion of people who are actually getting those speeds - not how widely available they are. The speeds and packages available to homes still depend on their physical address. Rural broadband, for example, broadly remains slower than the same technology in urban areas. Old-style ADSL (Asymmetric digital subscriber line) connections over copper wire, for example, are 36% higher in cities than outside them. But the gap between rural and urban connections is narrowing, the report found.Ofcom also launched a separate report on the same day on broadband availability - what is offered to homes, rather than what speeds are actually achieved.Full-fibre broadband is up by a fifth since last year, but is still only accessible to 12% of homes. Ultrafast broadband availability (300mpbs or higher) crept upward by 2% to 55% of households.",13 May 2020,technology
Inflatable e-scooter that fits in backpack unveiled,"An inflatable e-scooter compact enough to be stored inside a commuter's backpack has been unveiled in Japan. The Poimo, developed by the University of Tokyo, can be inflated in just over a minute, using an electric pump. The creators said they wanted to create a vehicle that minimised the potential for injury in the event of an accident. However, experts say e-scooter rules still need to be clarified by the government before such modes of transport can be considered safe. The Poimo has five solid, detachable components:It is made primarily out of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), which is already used to make products such as airbeds. The vehicle weighs about 5.5kg (12lb) in total.But researchers hope to reduce this for subsequent prototypes. ""We believe that our inflatable mobility, which is different from existing mobility systems and creates new relationships with people, will be useful for the city in the future,"" said Ryuma Niiyama, part of the development team at the University of Tokyo.Californian company Bird launched a pilot service in London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in 2018.But e-scooters are currently banned on UK roads. That could change next month, though, following an urgent government review of the legislation.Ollie Chadwhick, managing director at e-scooter-maker Electra-Zoom, said: ""We have written to the Transport Minister, Grant Shapps, asking him to expedite this legislation, so that people can revolutionise the way they travel, in tandem with the return to work and the arrival of summer, without the risks of overcrowded public transport or reliance on cars.""Media manager Sam Jones told BBC News: “Cycling UK believes they should be legalised but cautiously, keeping them off pavements and carefully limiting the maximum speed and power of their electric motors,"" Mr Jones . ""Cautious legislation can be relaxed if this proves to be justified. ""However, we can’t do the opposite and restrict faster or higher-powered e-scooters once people are already using them.""
