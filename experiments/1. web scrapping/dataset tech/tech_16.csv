Trump signs executive order targeting Twitter after fact-checking row,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms.He said the firms had ""unchecked power"" to censure and edit the views of users.President Trump has regularly accused platforms such as Twitter and Facebook of stifling conservative voices.The order, which is expected to face legal challenges, comes after Twitter decided to append fact-check labels to two of his tweets this week.On Wednesday Mr Trump accused the company of election interference after it added a warning label to the tweets about claims of widespread fraud in mail-in voting - also known as postal votes.Twitter and other social media platforms strongly condemned the executive order.And early on Friday, Twitter hid one of President Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.Under a 1996 law, website operators, unlike traditional publishers, cannot generally be held responsible for content posted by users.The sites are also protected from lawsuits if they block posts deemed obscene, violent ""or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected"".The executive order argues that this immunity should no longer apply if a social network edits posts, such as by adding a warning or a label. It also says ""deceptive"" blocking, including removing a post for reasons other than those described in a website's terms of service, should not be protected.Republican Senator Marco Rubio is among those arguing that the platforms take on the role of a ""publisher"" when they add fact-check labels to posts.""The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers,"" Mr Rubio said.""But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher, then they should no longer be shielded from liability."" The executive order also calls for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to spell out what type of content blocking will be considered deceptive or inconsistent with a service provider's terms and conditions.Donald Trump promised ""big action"" in response to Twitter's decision to append a fact-check message to two of his posts. While his announcement of an executive order was heavy on rhetoric - accusing social media companies of being monopolies that threaten free speech - it will be a long process before the talk turns into real action, big or otherwise.Independent government agencies will have to review federal law, promulgate new regulations, vote on them and then - in all likelihood - defend them in court. By the time it's all over, the November presidential election could have come and gone.That explains why Trump is also pushing for new congressional legislation - a more straightforward way of changing US policy toward social media companies. The real purpose of the president's order, however, may be symbolic. At the very least, the move will cause Twitter to think twice about attempting to moderate or fact-check his posts on their service. The president relies on Twitter to get his message out without filtering from the mainstream media. If Twitter itself start blunting one of his favourite communication tools, he is sending a message that he will push back - and make things, at a minimum, uncomfortable for the company.Twitter called the order ""a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law,"" adding that Section 230 ""protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it's underpinned by democratic values"".Google, which owns YouTube, said changing Section 230 would ""hurt America's economy and its global leadership on internet freedom.""""Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences,"" the firm said in a statement to the BBC.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship.

In an earlier tweet, he said Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.""Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that’s me.

He did not elaborate.With more than 52,000 tweets currently to his name, Mr Trump is a prolific tweeter and relies on the platform to disseminate his views to millions of people.He has used Twitter to launch attacks on opponents, with targets ranging from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to his political rivals in the US.In 2017 he used anti-Muslim tweets aimed at London Mayor Sadiq Khan to serve a domestic political purpose of warning about immigration, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher reported.On Tuesday Mr Trump's presidential campaign manager Brad Parscale also criticised Twitter's decision.""Partnering with biased fake news 'fact checkers' is a smoke screen to lend Twitter's obvious political tactics false credibility. There are many reasons we pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and clear political bias is one of them,"" Mr Parscale tweeted.They are voting bulletins that are distributed and returned by post. In a recent opinion survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 66% of Americans said they would not be comfortable going to a polling place to cast their ballot during the coronavirus outbreak.Such concerns have increased pressure on states to expand the availability of mail-in ballots for all voters in order to minimise the risk of viral exposure from in-person voting.While every state provides some form of remote voting, the requirements to qualify vary greatly.Five states in the western US, including Washington, Oregon and Colorado, conduct their elections entirely via mail-in ballot. Others, like California, provide a postal ballot to anyone who requests it.On the other end of the spectrum, 17 states require voters to provide a valid reason why they are unable to vote in-person in order to qualify for an absentee ballot. The move comes on the heels of Twitter's decision not to remove a comment President Trump made about the death of Lori Klausutis in 2001. The president has tweeted several messages promoting a conspiracy theory that Ms Klausutis was murdered by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Her widower Timothy Klausutis asked Twitter to remove the post, saying it included ""horrifying lies"".The company told Mr Klausutis it was ""deeply sorry"" about the pain caused by the president's statements, but said the tweets did not violate their policies.",27 May 2020,technology

""Fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud,"" it continues.The company had pledged to increase the use of warning labels about false or misleading information on its site, but has been slow to take steps against the US president.Mr Trump posted the same claim about mail-in ballots on Facebook, but it is not fact-checked on that platform.Mr Trump then accused Twitter of interfering in the US presidential election scheduled for 3 November 2020, saying the company was ""completely stifling free speech, and I, as president, will not allow it to happen"".His tweet on Wednesday told social media to ""clean up your act now"" and that he would not let a ""more sophisticated version"" of what they had ""attempted to do, and failed, in 2016"" happen again. He did not elaborate.With more than 52,000 tweets currently to his name, Mr Trump is a prolific tweeter and relies on the platform to disseminate his views to millions of people.He has used Twitter to launch attacks on opponents, with targets ranging from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to his political rivals in the US.In 2017 he used anti-Muslim tweets aimed at London Mayor Sadiq Khan to serve a domestic political purpose of warning about immigration, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher reported.On Tuesday Mr Trump's presidential campaign manager Brad Parscale also criticised Twitter's decision.""Partnering with biased fake news 'fact checkers' is a smoke screen to lend Twitter's obvious political tactics false credibility. There are many reasons we pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and clear political bias is one of them,"" Mr Parscale tweeted.They are voting bulletins that are distributed and returned by post. In a recent opinion survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 66% of Americans said they would not be comfortable going to a polling place to cast their ballot during the coronavirus outbreak.Such concerns have increased pressure on states to expand the availability of mail-in ballots for all voters in order to minimise the risk of viral exposure from in-person voting.While every state provides some form of remote voting, the requirements to qualify vary greatly.Five states in the western US, including Washington, Oregon and Colorado, conduct their elections entirely via mail-in ballot. Others, like California, provide a postal ballot to anyone who requests it.On the other end of the spectrum, 17 states require voters to provide a valid reason why they are unable to vote in-person in order to qualify for an absentee ballot. The move comes on the heels of Twitter's decision not to remove a comment President Trump made about the death of Lori Klausutis in 2001. The president has tweeted several messages promoting a conspiracy theory that Ms Klausutis was murdered by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Her widower Timothy Klausutis asked Twitter to remove the post, saying it included ""horrifying lies"".The company told Mr Klausutis it was ""deeply sorry"" about the pain caused by the president's statements, but said the tweets did not violate their policies.",27 May 2020,technology
Facebook dominates cases of recorded social media grooming,"Police in England and Wales recorded more than 10,000 online grooming offences on social media over two-and-a-half years.Where the method was recorded, more than half - 55% - took place on a Facebook-owned app.The figures come from freedom of information requests lodged by child protection charity the NSPCC. It is calling for the government to introduce stronger protections, warning that the rate of offences is rising.Just under a quarter of recorded offences - 23% - took place in the six months to October last year, the most recent period for which data is available.The data covers the first 30 months since the introduction of a law that made sexual communication with a child an explicit offence. In that time, police in the two nations recorded 10,119 offences. But police only recorded the platform used in 5,784 of those cases.Of those, more than half took place on a Facebook platform - including Facebook itself, its messenger app, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Instagram was the most common method among the Facebook-owned app, with 1,630 recorded offences - 16% of the total. Of 5,784 reports where the method of communication was recorded by policeThe NSPCC has previously warned that Facebook's shift to tightly encrypted messaging would aid offenders, and shareholders recently tried to block its plans for encryption on that basis.A Facebook spokesperson said: ""There is no place for grooming or child exploitation on our platforms, and we use technology to proactively find and quickly remove it.""We have a content and security team of over 35,000 people investigating reports from our community and working to keep our platforms safe. Our teams also work closely with child protection experts and law enforcement, reporting content directly to specialists.""Another 1,060 offences (18%) were recorded as taking place on Snapchat, owned by Snap Inc. It also said the exploitation of young people is absolutely unacceptable, and that eliminating such abuse was a priority for the company. The rest of the cases were made up of small numbers of cases across dozens of other platforms such as text messaging, online gaming, or websites.Because the data begins in early 2017 and runs to October 2019, it may not account for the most recent trends in platforms that young people use.The NSPCC says its information demonstrates the need for new regulation, and warned that the coronavirus lockdown had created ""a perfect storm for abusers"".It is calling for the government to push ahead with the proposed Online Harms Bill within 18 months.NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground in which to groom our kids.""Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.""",29 May 2020,technology
Trading Standards squad targets anti-5G USB stick,"Trading Standards officers are seeking to halt sales of a device that has been claimed to offer protection against the supposed dangers of 5G via use of quantum technology.Cyber-security experts say the £339 5GBioShield appears to no more than a basic USB drive.""We consider it to be a scam,"" Stephen Knight, operations director for London Trading Standards told the BBC.His said his team is working with City of London Police's Action Fraud squad.They are seeking a court order to take down the company's website.""People who are vulnerable need protection from this kind of unscrupulous trading,"" he added.The intervention follows an examination of the device, which was first reported by the BBC.The vendor - BioShield Distribution - had previously said the device was backed by ""research"", but has not responded to the latest development.The rollout of the new 5G mobile networks began in the UK only last summer and has not yet reached outside urban areas. Yet across the country there is already a cottage industry offering protection against the supposed negative health effects, even though they have been dismissed by regulators and mainstream scientists.The 5GBioShield was recommended by a member of Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee, which has called for an inquiry into 5G. One of nine external members, Toby Hall, said: ""We use this device and find it helpful,"" and provided a link to its website, which describes it as a USB key that ""provides protection for  your home and family, thanks to the wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser, which can be worn or placed near to a smartphone or any other electrical, radiation or EMF [electromagnetic field] emitting device"".""Through a process of quantum oscillation, the 5GBioShield USB key balances and re-harmonises the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wi-fi, tablets, et cetera,"" it adds.Each of these USB keys costs £339.60 including VAT, though there is a special offer of three for £958.80.But, at first sight, it seems to be just that - a USB key, with just 128MB of storage.""So what's different between it and a virtually identical 'crystal' USB key available from various suppliers in Shenzhen, China, for around £5 per key?"" asks Ken Munro, whose company, Pen Test Partners, specialises in taking apart consumer electronic products to spot security vulnerabilities.And the answer appears to be a circular sticker. ""Now, we're not 5G quantum experts but said sticker looks remarkably like one available in sheets from stationery suppliers for less than a penny each,"" he says.Mr Munro and his colleague Phil Eveleigh proceeded to dismantle the USB key to find out if there were any whizz-bang electronics inside. But all they found was an LED light on the circuit board, similar to those on any other USB key.Their conclusion was that trading standards bodies should carry out their own investigations.A search in Companies House shows the two directors of BioShield Distribution are Anna Grochowalska and Valerio Laghezza. Both of them appear to have been involved previously in a business called Immortalis, which sells a dietary supplement called Klotho Formula. Its website - rather similar in design to that of the BioShield - says Klotho Formula uses a ""proprietary procedure that leads to relativistic time dilation and biological quantum entanglement at the DNA level"".Ms Grochowalska told BBC News her company was the sole global distributor of the 5GBioShield -  but it did not manufacture or own the product. ""We are in possession of a great deal of technical information, with plenty of back-up historical research,"" she said.""As you can understand, we are not authorised to fully disclose all this sensitive information to third parties, for obvious reasons.""And she rejected the suggestion selling a £5 product for more than £300 was unreasonable.""In regard to the costs analysis your research has produced, I believe that the lack of in-depth information will not drive you to the exact computation of our expenses and production costs, including the cost of IP [intellectual property rights], and so on,"" she said.""It is therefore hard to take your evaluation seriously, since you have evidently not researched the background facts in any meaningful way.""Mr Hall said his remarks in Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee report should not be seen as a recommendation to buy the product.But he had no regrets about buying it and since plugging it in had felt beneficial effects, including being able to sleep through the night and having more dreams. ""I also felt a 'calmer' feel to the home,"" he told BBC News.And he had thought the company might be able to develop a system that could offer protection to the whole town of Glastonbury against the effects of radiation from electromagnetic fields.It's worth noting though that the regulator Ofcom has published the results of EMF measurements at 16 sites, which were taken following the launch of 5G. It said that in each case, emissions were ""a small fraction"" of the levels deemed safe under international guidelines.",28 May 2020,technology
Trump signs executive order targeting Twitter after fact-checking row,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms.He said the firms had ""unchecked power"" to censure and edit the views of users.President Trump has regularly accused platforms such as Twitter and Facebook of stifling conservative voices.The order, which is expected to face legal challenges, comes after Twitter decided to append fact-check labels to two of his tweets this week.On Wednesday Mr Trump accused the company of election interference after it added a warning label to the tweets about claims of widespread fraud in mail-in voting - also known as postal votes.Twitter and other social media platforms strongly condemned the executive order.And early on Friday, Twitter hid one of President Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.Under a 1996 law, website operators, unlike traditional publishers, cannot generally be held responsible for content posted by users.The sites are also protected from lawsuits if they block posts deemed obscene, violent ""or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected"".The executive order argues that this immunity should no longer apply if a social network edits posts, such as by adding a warning or a label. It also says ""deceptive"" blocking, including removing a post for reasons other than those described in a website's terms of service, should not be protected.Republican Senator Marco Rubio is among those arguing that the platforms take on the role of a ""publisher"" when they add fact-check labels to posts.""The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers,"" Mr Rubio said.""But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher, then they should no longer be shielded from liability."" The executive order also calls for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to spell out what type of content blocking will be considered deceptive or inconsistent with a service provider's terms and conditions.Donald Trump promised ""big action"" in response to Twitter's decision to append a fact-check message to two of his posts. While his announcement of an executive order was heavy on rhetoric - accusing social media companies of being monopolies that threaten free speech - it will be a long process before the talk turns into real action, big or otherwise.Independent government agencies will have to review federal law, promulgate new regulations, vote on them and then - in all likelihood - defend them in court. By the time it's all over, the November presidential election could have come and gone.That explains why Trump is also pushing for new congressional legislation - a more straightforward way of changing US policy toward social media companies. The real purpose of the president's order, however, may be symbolic. At the very least, the move will cause Twitter to think twice about attempting to moderate or fact-check his posts on their service. The president relies on Twitter to get his message out without filtering from the mainstream media. If Twitter itself start blunting one of his favourite communication tools, he is sending a message that he will push back - and make things, at a minimum, uncomfortable for the company.Twitter called the order ""a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law,"" adding that Section 230 ""protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it's underpinned by democratic values"".Google, which owns YouTube, said changing Section 230 would ""hurt America's economy and its global leadership on internet freedom.""""Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences,"" the firm said in a statement to the BBC.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship. ""I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social media companies flared up again on Tuesday, when two of his posts were given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time.He had tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is no way (zero) that mail-in ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page describing the claims as ""unsubstantiated"".Then on Wednesday, Mr Trump threatened to ""strongly regulate"" social-media platforms.He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"", and that he would not allow this to happen. In an earlier tweet, he said Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.""Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that’s me. Please leave our employees out of this. We’ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make.End of Twitter post  by @jackTwitter has tightened its policies in recent years, as it faced criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.",29 May 2020,technology
Thousands of TalkTalk users hit by internet problems,"Tens of thousands of TalkTalk customers reported problems with their internet connection on Friday morning.Popular tracking website DownDetector logged more than 30,000 reports beginning at around 10:00 BST, scattered across the UK.TalkTalk's Twitter feed was flooded with reports from users trying to work from home without internet.The firm said the problem was fixed at around 11:30 BST, but it did not provide any details about the cause.""We're aware that some customers were unable to access certain websites for a short period earlier today,"" the company said in a statement.""The issue has now been resolved and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.""Earlier, it had suggested that some services were unaffected by the problem. We're aware that some customers were unable to access certain websites for a short period earlier today.

Uber destroys thousands of bikes and scooters,"Uber is destroying thousands of electric bikes and scooters, after selling its Jump business to Lime.Videos of its red bikes being crushed at a US recycling centre were shared on social media, angering cycling advocates.Uber said it had decided to destroy thousands of its older-model vehicles due to maintenance, liability and safety concerns.In the UK, Uber continues to operate Jump and has not scrapped any bikes.A spokesman told the BBC the sale of Jump to Lime had not been completed in Europe, and that Jump continued to operate ""as normal"" in London.In 2018, Uber said it would focus more on its electric bike and scooter business than on cars.But on 7 May this year, Uber announced a deal that saw Lime take over the Jump bike business.As part of the deal, Uber invested $170m (£139m) in Lime, while Lime acquired ""tens of thousands"" of Uber's Jump bikes - and the associated intellectual property.Lime's chief executive Wayne Ting has said he prefers the design of Uber's bikes and will deploy more of them in the future.However, there were also ""tens of thousands"" of older-model bikes that Lime did not inherit as part of the deal.Videos shared on Twitter show the bikes arriving at a recycling facility in North Carolina to be destroyed.Disappointed charities and organisations suggested the bikes could have been donated to community groups, or sold to individuals to boost the uptake of electric bikes.""Why not at least peel the decals [branding] off and sell the bikes to individuals?"" Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, a non-profit group, told news site Motherboard.""We explored donating the remaining, older-model bikes,"" Uber said in a statement.""But given many significant issues - including maintenance, liability, safety concerns, and a lack of consumer-grade charging equipment - we decided the best approach was to responsibly recycle them.""",28 May 2020,technology
Twitter hides Trump tweet for 'glorifying violence',"Twitter has hidden one of President Donald Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.But instead of being deleted, it has been replaced with a warning and can be viewed by clicking on it.The warning says ""Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.""It is the latest in an escalating row between Twitter and the White House.Mr Trump was tweeting about the US city of Minneapolis, which has seen consecutive nights of protests following the death of a black man in police custody.The president said he would ""send in the National Guard"", and followed that up with a warning that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""That second tweet was hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"".Hours later, the official White House account tweeted a copy of the president's words, which Twitter has yet to take any action on.Twitter's policy of adding a warning to, rather than deleting, tweets that break its rules when it comes to major public figures was announced in mid-2019. But the social network has never used it on Mr Trump - nor deleted any of his tweets before.""This is the bravest and riskiest thing I've ever seen Twitter - or any social media giant - do,"" said Carl Miller, from the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at UK-based think-tank Demos.""This pours rocket fuel over the online-harm-versus-free-speech debate. Online content policy doesn't get more incendiary than this.""The same post remains unaltered on Facebook, without any warning attached.For years Twitter resisted calls to treat Donald Trump like any other user and make him follow its rules. Then, on Wednesday, it made a first small move, not removing a tweet but adding a fact-checking link. The company then had two choices - hunker down and weather the storm or continue to take action in accordance with its stated rules. It has now chosen the latter course of action,  calling the President out for glorifying violence. Any other user would have had their tweet removed, and might have seen their account suspended. It now looks as though there is no easy way out for either of the two adversaries - a huge battle over the limits of free speech and the rights of social media firms to moderate content is looming.The move means that other users will not be able to like, reply, or retweet it, Twitter said - but would still be able to retweet with a comment attached.In a Twitter thread, the social network said: ""This tweet violates our policies regarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today.""The ""historical context"" is a reference to the phrase ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" coined by Miami Police Chief Walter Headley in 1967, in reference to his aggressive policing policies in black neighbourhoods.A later US report found that his ""get tough"" policy, involving ""the frequent display of shotguns and dogs by Miami police in black neighbourhoods"" contributed to a state of agitation in the black community until the eruption of the 1968 Miami riot some eight months later.Twitter said: ""We've taken action in the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.""Hours after the warning was added, President Trump tweeted: ""Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party"" and alleged that the social network was targeting Republicans.Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party. They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives & the President of the United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpHe directly referenced the executive order he signed the previous evening, aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms.Earlier this week, Twitter used its fact-checking function to attach warnings to the president's tweets for the first time. That led the President to threaten to ""shut down"" the social networks over allegedly stifling free speech.The executive order signed by Mr Trump has no immediate effect on the social networks, however - it instead begins a lengthy process that may result in changes down the line.",29 May 2020,technology

The executive order also calls for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to spell out what type of content blocking will be considered deceptive or inconsistent with a service provider's terms and conditions.Donald Trump promised ""big action"" in response to Twitter's decision to append a fact-check message to two of his posts. While his announcement of an executive order was heavy on rhetoric - accusing social media companies of being monopolies that threaten free speech - it will be a long process before the talk turns into real action, big or otherwise.Independent government agencies will have to review federal law, promulgate new regulations, vote on them and then - in all likelihood - defend them in court. By the time it's all over, the November presidential election could have come and gone.That explains why Trump is also pushing for new congressional legislation - a more straightforward way of changing US policy toward social media companies. The real purpose of the president's order, however, may be symbolic. At the very least, the move will cause Twitter to think twice about attempting to moderate or fact-check his posts on their service. The president relies on Twitter to get his message out without filtering from the mainstream media. If Twitter itself start blunting one of his favourite communication tools, he is sending a message that he will push back - and make things, at a minimum, uncomfortable for the company.Twitter called the order ""a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law,"" adding that Section 230 ""protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it's underpinned by democratic values"".Google, which owns YouTube, said changing Section 230 would ""hurt America's economy and its global leadership on internet freedom.""""Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences,"" the firm said in a statement to the BBC.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship. ""I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social media companies flared up again on Tuesday, when two of his posts were given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time.He had tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is no way (zero) that mail-in ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page describing the claims as ""unsubstantiated"".Then on Wednesday, Mr Trump threatened to ""strongly regulate"" social-media platforms.He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"", and that he would not allow this to happen. In an earlier tweet, he said Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.""Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that’s me. Please leave our employees out of this. We’ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make.End of Twitter post  by @jackTwitter has tightened its policies in recent years, as it faced criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.",29 May 2020,technology
Twitter tags Trump tweet with fact-checking warning,"A post by US President Donald Trump has been given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time.Mr Trump tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""Twitter put a warning label in the post and linked to a page that described the claims as ""unsubstantiated"".Mr Trump on Wednesday threatened to ""strongly regulate"" or even ""close down"" social media platforms.He tweeted to his 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"" and that he would not allow this to happen. In an earlier tweet, he said that Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".Later on Wednesday he said that Twitter ""has now shown everything we have been saying about them... is correct"" and vowed ""big action to follow"".It is unclear what regulatory steps the president could take without new laws passed by Congress. The White House has yet to offer further details.For years, Twitter has faced criticism for not acting on the president's controversial tweets, which include personal attacks on political rivals and debunked conspiracy theories. This month the platform introduced a new policy on misleading information amid the coronavirus pandemic.But recent posts in which Mr Trump - who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter - promoted a conspiracy theory about the death of political aide Lori Klausutis, blaming a high-profile critic, have not received the same treatment.The notification on Mr Trump's tweet shows a blue exclamation mark and a link suggesting readers ""get the facts about mail-in ballots"".It directs users to a page on which Mr Trump's claims are described as ""unsubstantiated"", citing reporting by CNN, the Washington Post and others.The pandemic is putting pressure on US states to expand the use of postal voting because people are worried about becoming infected at polling stations.In a ""what you need to know"" section, Twitter writes that Mr Trump ""falsely claimed mail-in ballots would lead to 'a Rigged Election'."" ""Fact-checkers say there is no evidence that mail-in ballots are linked to voter fraud,"" it continues.The company had pledged to increase the use of warning labels about false or misleading information on its site, but has been slow to take steps against the US president.Mr Trump posted the same claim about mail-in ballots on Facebook, but it is not fact-checked on that platform.Mr Trump then accused Twitter of interfering in the US presidential election scheduled for 3 November 2020, saying the company was ""completely stifling free speech, and I, as president, will not allow it to happen"".His tweet on Wednesday told social media to ""clean up your act now"" and that he would not let a ""more sophisticated version"" of what they had ""attempted to do, and failed, in 2016"" happen again. He did not elaborate.With more than 52,000 tweets currently to his name, Mr Trump is a prolific tweeter and relies on the platform to disseminate his views to millions of people.He has used Twitter to launch attacks on opponents, with targets ranging from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to his political rivals in the US.In 2017 he used anti-Muslim tweets aimed at London Mayor Sadiq Khan to serve a domestic political purpose of warning about immigration, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher reported.On Tuesday Mr Trump's presidential campaign manager Brad Parscale also criticised Twitter's decision.""Partnering with biased fake news 'fact checkers' is a smoke screen to lend Twitter's obvious political tactics false credibility. There are many reasons we pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and clear political bias is one of them,"" Mr Parscale tweeted.They are voting bulletins that are distributed and returned by post. In a recent opinion survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 66% of Americans said they would not be comfortable going to a polling place to cast their ballot during the coronavirus outbreak.Such concerns have increased pressure on states to expand the availability of mail-in ballots for all voters in order to minimise the risk of viral exposure from in-person voting.While every state provides some form of remote voting, the requirements to qualify vary greatly.Five states in the western US, including Washington, Oregon and Colorado, conduct their elections entirely via mail-in ballot. Others, like California, provide a postal ballot to anyone who requests it.On the other end of the spectrum, 17 states require voters to provide a valid reason why they are unable to vote in-person in order to qualify for an absentee ballot. The move comes on the heels of Twitter's decision not to remove a comment President Trump made about the death of Lori Klausutis in 2001. The president has tweeted several messages promoting a conspiracy theory that Ms Klausutis was murdered by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Her widower Timothy Klausutis asked Twitter to remove the post, saying it included ""horrifying lies"".The company told Mr Klausutis it was ""deeply sorry"" about the pain caused by the president's statements, but said the tweets did not violate their policies.",27 May 2020,technology
Facebook dominates cases of recorded social media grooming,"Police in England and Wales recorded more than 10,000 online grooming offences on social media over two-and-a-half years.Where the method was recorded, more than half - 55% - took place on a Facebook-owned app.The figures come from freedom of information requests lodged by child protection charity the NSPCC. It is calling for the government to introduce stronger protections, warning that the rate of offences is rising.Just under a quarter of recorded offences - 23% - took place in the six months to October last year, the most recent period for which data is available.The data covers the first 30 months since the introduction of a law that made sexual communication with a child an explicit offence. In that time, police in the two nations recorded 10,119 offences. But police only recorded the platform used in 5,784 of those cases.Of those, more than half took place on a Facebook platform - including Facebook itself, its messenger app, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Instagram was the most common method among the Facebook-owned app, with 1,630 recorded offences - 16% of the total. Of 5,784 reports where the method of communication was recorded by policeThe NSPCC has previously warned that Facebook's shift to tightly encrypted messaging would aid offenders, and shareholders recently tried to block its plans for encryption on that basis.A Facebook spokesperson said: ""There is no place for grooming or child exploitation on our platforms, and we use technology to proactively find and quickly remove it.""We have a content and security team of over 35,000 people investigating reports from our community and working to keep our platforms safe. Our teams also work closely with child protection experts and law enforcement, reporting content directly to specialists.""Another 1,060 offences (18%) were recorded as taking place on Snapchat, owned by Snap Inc. It also said the exploitation of young people is absolutely unacceptable, and that eliminating such abuse was a priority for the company. The rest of the cases were made up of small numbers of cases across dozens of other platforms such as text messaging, online gaming, or websites.Because the data begins in early 2017 and runs to October 2019, it may not account for the most recent trends in platforms that young people use.The NSPCC says its information demonstrates the need for new regulation, and warned that the coronavirus lockdown had created ""a perfect storm for abusers"".It is calling for the government to push ahead with the proposed Online Harms Bill within 18 months.NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground in which to groom our kids.""Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.""",29 May 2020,technology
Trading Standards squad targets anti-5G USB stick,"Trading Standards officers are seeking to halt sales of a device that has been claimed to offer protection against the supposed dangers of 5G via use of quantum technology.Cyber-security experts say the £339 5GBioShield appears to no more than a basic USB drive.""We consider it to be a scam,"" Stephen Knight, operations director for London Trading Standards told the BBC.His said his team is working with City of London Police's Action Fraud squad.They are seeking a court order to take down the company's website.""People who are vulnerable need protection from this kind of unscrupulous trading,"" he added.The intervention follows an examination of the device, which was first reported by the BBC.The vendor - BioShield Distribution - had previously said the device was backed by ""research"", but has not responded to the latest development.The rollout of the new 5G mobile networks began in the UK only last summer and has not yet reached outside urban areas. Yet across the country there is already a cottage industry offering protection against the supposed negative health effects, even though they have been dismissed by regulators and mainstream scientists.The 5GBioShield was recommended by a member of Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee, which has called for an inquiry into 5G. One of nine external members, Toby Hall, said: ""We use this device and find it helpful,"" and provided a link to its website, which describes it as a USB key that ""provides protection for  your home and family, thanks to the wearable holographic nano-layer catalyser, which can be worn or placed near to a smartphone or any other electrical, radiation or EMF [electromagnetic field] emitting device"".""Through a process of quantum oscillation, the 5GBioShield USB key balances and re-harmonises the disturbing frequencies arising from the electric fog induced by devices, such as laptops, cordless phones, wi-fi, tablets, et cetera,"" it adds.Each of these USB keys costs £339.60 including VAT, though there is a special offer of three for £958.80.But, at first sight, it seems to be just that - a USB key, with just 128MB of storage.""So what's different between it and a virtually identical 'crystal' USB key available from various suppliers in Shenzhen, China, for around £5 per key?"" asks Ken Munro, whose company, Pen Test Partners, specialises in taking apart consumer electronic products to spot security vulnerabilities.And the answer appears to be a circular sticker. ""Now, we're not 5G quantum experts but said sticker looks remarkably like one available in sheets from stationery suppliers for less than a penny each,"" he says.Mr Munro and his colleague Phil Eveleigh proceeded to dismantle the USB key to find out if there were any whizz-bang electronics inside. But all they found was an LED light on the circuit board, similar to those on any other USB key.Their conclusion was that trading standards bodies should carry out their own investigations.A search in Companies House shows the two directors of BioShield Distribution are Anna Grochowalska and Valerio Laghezza. Both of them appear to have been involved previously in a business called Immortalis, which sells a dietary supplement called Klotho Formula. Its website - rather similar in design to that of the BioShield - says Klotho Formula uses a ""proprietary procedure that leads to relativistic time dilation and biological quantum entanglement at the DNA level"".Ms Grochowalska told BBC News her company was the sole global distributor of the 5GBioShield -  but it did not manufacture or own the product. ""We are in possession of a great deal of technical information, with plenty of back-up historical research,"" she said.""As you can understand, we are not authorised to fully disclose all this sensitive information to third parties, for obvious reasons.""And she rejected the suggestion selling a £5 product for more than £300 was unreasonable.""In regard to the costs analysis your research has produced, I believe that the lack of in-depth information will not drive you to the exact computation of our expenses and production costs, including the cost of IP [intellectual property rights], and so on,"" she said.""It is therefore hard to take your evaluation seriously, since you have evidently not researched the background facts in any meaningful way.""Mr Hall said his remarks in Glastonbury Town Council's 5G Advisory Committee report should not be seen as a recommendation to buy the product.But he had no regrets about buying it and since plugging it in had felt beneficial effects, including being able to sleep through the night and having more dreams. ""I also felt a 'calmer' feel to the home,"" he told BBC News.And he had thought the company might be able to develop a system that could offer protection to the whole town of Glastonbury against the effects of radiation from electromagnetic fields.It's worth noting though that the regulator Ofcom has published the results of EMF measurements at 16 sites, which were taken following the launch of 5G. It said that in each case, emissions were ""a small fraction"" of the levels deemed safe under international guidelines.",28 May 2020,technology

Uber destroys thousands of bikes and scooters,"Uber is destroying thousands of electric bikes and scooters, after selling its Jump business to Lime.Videos of its red bikes being crushed at a US recycling centre were shared on social media, angering cycling advocates.Uber said it had decided to destroy thousands of its older-model vehicles due to maintenance, liability and safety concerns.In the UK, Uber continues to operate Jump and has not scrapped any bikes.A spokesman told the BBC the sale of Jump to Lime had not been completed in Europe, and that Jump continued to operate ""as normal"" in London.In 2018, Uber said it would focus more on its electric bike and scooter business than on cars.But on 7 May this year, Uber announced a deal that saw Lime take over the Jump bike business.As part of the deal, Uber invested $170m (£139m) in Lime, while Lime acquired ""tens of thousands"" of Uber's Jump bikes - and the associated intellectual property.Lime's chief executive Wayne Ting has said he prefers the design of Uber's bikes and will deploy more of them in the future.However, there were also ""tens of thousands"" of older-model bikes that Lime did not inherit as part of the deal.Videos shared on Twitter show the bikes arriving at a recycling facility in North Carolina to be destroyed.Disappointed charities and organisations suggested the bikes could have been donated to community groups, or sold to individuals to boost the uptake of electric bikes.""Why not at least peel the decals [branding] off and sell the bikes to individuals?"" Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, a non-profit group, told news site Motherboard.""We explored donating the remaining, older-model bikes,"" Uber said in a statement.""But given many significant issues - including maintenance, liability, safety concerns, and a lack of consumer-grade charging equipment - we decided the best approach was to responsibly recycle them.""",28 May 2020,technology

By the time it's all over, the November presidential election could have come and gone.That explains why Trump is also pushing for new congressional legislation - a more straightforward way of changing US policy toward social media companies. The real purpose of the president's order, however, may be symbolic. At the very least, the move will cause Twitter to think twice about attempting to moderate or fact-check his posts on their service. The president relies on Twitter to get his message out without filtering from the mainstream media. If Twitter itself start blunting one of his favourite communication tools, he is sending a message that he will push back - and make things, at a minimum, uncomfortable for the company.Twitter called the order ""a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law,"" adding that Section 230 ""protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it's underpinned by democratic values"".Google, which owns YouTube, said changing Section 230 would ""hurt America's economy and its global leadership on internet freedom.""""Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences,"" the firm said in a statement to the BBC.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship. ""I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social media companies flared up again on Tuesday, when two of his posts were given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time.He had tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is no way (zero) that mail-in ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page describing the claims as ""unsubstantiated"".Then on Wednesday, Mr Trump threatened to ""strongly regulate"" social-media platforms.He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"", and that he would not allow this to happen. In an earlier tweet, he said Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.""Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that’s me. Please leave our employees out of this. We’ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make.End of Twitter post  by @jackTwitter has tightened its policies in recent years, as it faced criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.",29 May 2020,technology

Uber destroys thousands of bikes and scooters,"Uber is destroying thousands of electric bikes and scooters, after selling its Jump business to Lime.Videos of its red bikes being crushed at a US recycling centre were shared on social media, angering cycling advocates.Uber said it had decided to destroy thousands of its older-model vehicles due to maintenance, liability and safety concerns.In the UK, Uber continues to operate Jump and has not scrapped any bikes.A spokesman told the BBC the sale of Jump to Lime had not been completed in Europe, and that Jump continued to operate ""as normal"" in London.In 2018, Uber said it would focus more on its electric bike and scooter business than on cars.But on 7 May this year, Uber announced a deal that saw Lime take over the Jump bike business.As part of the deal, Uber invested $170m (£139m) in Lime, while Lime acquired ""tens of thousands"" of Uber's Jump bikes - and the associated intellectual property.Lime's chief executive Wayne Ting has said he prefers the design of Uber's bikes and will deploy more of them in the future.However, there were also ""tens of thousands"" of older-model bikes that Lime did not inherit as part of the deal.Videos shared on Twitter show the bikes arriving at a recycling facility in North Carolina to be destroyed.Disappointed charities and organisations suggested the bikes could have been donated to community groups, or sold to individuals to boost the uptake of electric bikes.""Why not at least peel the decals [branding] off and sell the bikes to individuals?"" Jon Orcutt of Bike New York, a non-profit group, told news site Motherboard.""We explored donating the remaining, older-model bikes,"" Uber said in a statement.""But given many significant issues - including maintenance, liability, safety concerns, and a lack of consumer-grade charging equipment - we decided the best approach was to responsibly recycle them.""",28 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: France set to roll out contact-tracing app before UK,"French smartphone owners can download a coronavirus contact-tracing app from Tuesday, its Prime Minister said. That is set to pre-date a UK counterpart.The move will coincide with France's lifting of several restrictions, including the reopening of some bars, restaurants, beaches and parks.A bug bounty scheme will be run to encourage the public to help identify any flaws in the software.But critics claim it suffers from a ""fundamentally flawed design"".Edouard Phillippe's announcement came a day after France's Senate approved the app's release by a vote of 187-to-127, which in turn followed an 338-to-215 National Assembly vote.The StopCovid app will supplement work already being done by a French team of human contact tracers who are trying to identify people who are infected with the disease but unaware of the fact.The app works by using Bluetooth signals to detect when two handsets are in close proximity, in order to log an estimation of the distance and length of the encounter.France, like the UK, has opted for a ""centralised"" app, which carries out contact matches on a computer server.That contrasts with the ""decentralised"" model - an approach advocated by Google and Apple - which carries out matches on users' own devices.The main differences between the two are that centralised apps provide the authorities greater scope to delve into gathered data to refine their approach to tackling the pandemic, while decentralised ones in theory promise users a greater degree of anonymity and privacy.The French government has made appeals to national pride over its decision to roll out a proprietary solution.It faces having an incompatible system to its neighbours Germany, Switzerland and Italy as a consequence.""This is a French project, with the excellence but also the panache and some would say the stubbornness which characterises our country,"" Digital Affairs Minister Cedric O said on Wednesday.""Is it really a coincidence that 22 countries have used the Apple-Google API [application programming interface], but not France and Britain, which are the only two countries in Europe with their own nuclear deterrent?""The risk for the French government is that its decision to adopt the centralised model deters members of the public from installing it.The app's developers have acknowledged that although users' identities are anonymised before they upload their logs to the central server, it is in theory still possible to re-identify them afterwards.That has concerned civil rights activists.""It could threaten the right to privacy and more generally the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly because it opens up a way to monitor the interactions of everyone who installs it,"" Amnesty International France has said.Some security researchers have also called for the rollout to be delayed until a Bluetooth vulnerability - full details of which have yet to be made public - is addressed. The issue does no affect apps based on the Apple-Google model.The French government has, however, invited a select group of ""ethical hackers"" to audit the app's code in advance of its launch. And it has teamed up with the European bug bounty programme YesWeHack, which will offer cash rewards to anyone who finds critical flaws in the program after its release.England had originally planned to launch its own NHS Covid-19 app nationwide in conjunction with the start of phone calls by its Test and Trace team of human investigators, which happened this morning.Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he now wants to stagger the two, and plans to deploy the app within the next fortnight.Before then, NHSX is set to carry out a second phase of a trial of the software already under way on the Isle of Wight.At present, the app solely relies on users self-diagnosing themselves via a series of on-screen questions. The next stage of the test will involve incorporating medical test results.Other parts of the UK have still to decide whether to deploy the same app locally or take a different approach.",28 May 2020,technology
Twitter fact-checks China amid bias row,"Twitter, under intense scrutiny for its use of fact-checking warnings, has added them to tweets from China's foreign ministry spokesperson.The warning has been added to tweets from spokesman Lijian Zhao, in which he warned: ""It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.""Twitter added the warning more than two months after the tweets were posted.It comes amid a row with the White House, after similar warnings were added to tweets from President Trump.Mr Trump is now poised to sign an executive order targeting social-media firms, the White House said, in a significant escalation of the dispute. Earlier this week, after Twitter added its fact-checking links to President Trump's tweets, he threatened to ""shut down"" social networks for alleged anti-conservative bias.The warnings on Lijian Zhao's tweets were added after the US developments.One tweet, from 12 March, criticised the US Centers for Disease Control for a lack of clarity before alleging that it ""might be"" that the US army was somehow involved in the Wuhan outbreak.In another tweet the following day, he linked to an article claiming to have evidence that the virus originated in the United States, encouraging people to read and retweet it - which thousands did.Both tweets now contains a bright blue exclamation mark urging readers to ""Get the facts about Covid-19"". Clicking it directs the user to a page of tweets about the World Health Organization's research that suggests the virus originated in animals, and downplays theories about deliberate human involvement in its spread.The New York Post, which broke the story, said Twitter had added the warning only after its reporters put pressure on the company over alleged ""double standards"" between the Chinese official and Mr Trump.A Twitter spokesperson would not confirm whether that was the case, saying only that Mr Zhao's tweets ""contain potentially misleading content about Covid-19"" and were labelled to ""provide additional context"".Twitter founder Jack Dorsey meanwhile, appealed to users to ""please leave our employees out of this"" as the row with the White House erupted.Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, has been blamed by many Conservatives as the man behind the effort to fact-check the president. Many prominent Republican voices on Twitter pointed to old tweets by Mr Roth which refer to ""Nazis in the White House"" and other insults about the president and his allies.Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House aide with the job title of counsellor to the president, appeared to encourage supporters to contact Mr Roth online, saying on Fox News that someone should ""go wake him up and tell him he's about to get more followers"". Twitter, however, insists that no one person is responsible for its fact-checking decisions.""There is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that's me,"" Mr Dorsey tweeted, promising to continue to ""point out incorrect or disputed information"".""Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves. More transparency from us is critical so folks can clearly see the why behind our actions,"" he said.The approach differs from that of Facebook.Sir Nick Clegg, a prominent former UK politician turned Facebook's vice-president of communications, said the company doesn't believe ""a private tech company like ours should be in the business of vetting what politicians say about each other"", the Telegraph reports.""We think people should be allowed to hear what politicians say so they can make up their own mind and hold the politician to account,"" he said.",28 May 2020,technology
Video streaming: Lockdown sees fifth of UK homes sign deals,"One in five households in Britain – six million – signed up to an online video subscription service during the Covid-19 lockdown, data suggests.The majority of those sign-ups, 52%, are going to Disney+, according to market research firm Kantar.The most-enjoyed piece of content, though, was Netflix’s exclusive documentary series Tiger King.AppleTV+ struggled to engage TV viewers, however, according to the research.Kantar’s data shows the tech giant’s TV service was popular on smartphone and tablet devices, but lagged behind competitors in terms of TV screen viewing.“It’s been a huge quarter for streaming in the UK. We can certainly associate a good deal of that with the current lockdown situation,” Dominic Sunnebo, senior vice president at Kantar, told the BBC.Mr Sunnebo also noted the instant popularity of Disney+, which only launched in the UK on 24 March.“Of people who are in the video streaming sector already, one in five now have a Disney+ streaming subscription,” he said. “It’s unheard of.”There are now, on average, 2.3 online video subscriptions per household in the UK. Although comparable data is not available for previous years, Mr Sunnebo said that because of the launch of new services such as Disney+, it was safe to assume that the average number of online video subscriptions had risen comfortably in the last couple of years.He added that 36% of new subscriptions between February and April – 2.2 million – were made by people who had never previously signed up to a streaming service.Kantar’s data is gathered from a panel of 15,000 consumers and interviews with 2,500 new streaming service subscribers each quarter.Apple struggled to make the same impact with TV viewers, however.Mr Sunnebo argued that this was probably because that easiest way to access Apple TV+ on a TV screen was through purchasing a separate device, the Apple TV media player.Apple’s strategy, he said, was to rely on slowly building an audience of viewers happy to pay for this hardware.“By trying to drive Apple TV sales in the meantime, they’re continuing to generate revenue and biding time to broaden their catalogue of content,” he added.Recent examples of this include the addition of old episodes of the children's show Fraggle Rock as well the commission of new ones. And, according to news site Deadline, Apple has just struck a deal to stream Martin Scorsese's forthcoming film Killers of the Flower Moon, which is set to feature Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert DeNiro.",28 May 2020,technology
Huawei: What would happen if the UK ditched the Chinese firm?,"Huawei's future in the UK is in doubt - again.The consequences could affect how quickly improved internet access is rolled out and how much it will cost. This a time when the country's economy is already in a precarious state because of the coronavirus pandemic.The catalyst for a potential rethink is the US's move to restrict the firm's ability to buy chips, which was justified on ""national security grounds"".On Sunday, the UK's National Security Centre (NCSC) confirmed it was examining what impact this would have on the UK networks that use Huawei's tech.That sounds quite vague. But it potentially paves the way for a government U-turn.In January, the prime minister gave the green light to continued use of the firm's tech in mobile and broadband networks, but said its its market share must be reduced.Now he might appreciate the chance for change of mind.It would help Boris Johnson prevent backbenchers who favour a ban from derailing his forthcoming Telecoms Infrastructure Bill. Moreover, it offers him a way to defuse tensions with the White House, which has said continued use of Huawei will have a ""dramatic impact on our ability to share [security] information"".Mr Johnson and President Trump may meet next month at a mooted G7 summit. Blocking Huawei could help secure a post-Brexit trade deal, even if it made relations with China trickier.But the company warns there would be consequences.""More suppliers means greater competition, innovation and network reliability, and crucially ensures consumers have access to the best possible technology,"" Victor Zhang, Huawei's UK chief, told the BBC.""Removing Huawei would seriously delay 5G, costing the British economy up to £7bn,"" he added, citing a study published last year by Mobile UK, a trade group that represents UK network operators.Part of the reason mobile providers are concerned is that the current version of 5G relies on new equipment being plugged into existing 4G kit from the same vendor.""A lot of the 4G expansion was software-upgradeable to do 5G when an extra mast antenna was fitted,"" explained Andrew Ferguson, editor-in-chief of the news site ThinkBroadband.So, he added, even if a Huawei ban was limited to the newer technology, networks would still have to rip out and replace some of their older infrastructure as well.""It's not only a very expensive process for the operators, but it's going to be a time-consuming one as well because they need to get access to all those sites to make the changes,"" added Matthew Howett from Assembly, the consultancy that wrote Mobile UK's report.""And Huawei has been very innovative at coming up with the smallest and lightest 5G equipment, meaning the operators can sometimes just use a cherry picker to hook it onto existing mast infrastructure. Some of the others' is heavier and bulkier, which can require more in terms of getting planning consent and road closures.""Huawei's major 5G rivals are Nokia and Ericsson - two European firms.The networks claim that having three providers to choose from helps them negotiate lower prices. In many cases, they want a mix of two suppliers so that if technical problems arise with one they can fall back on the other to provide a reduced service. That doesn't always involve Huawei - O2 for instance picked Nokia and Ericsson to be its primary 5G vendors despite having trialled the Chinese firm's kit.A study commissioned by Huawei last year claimed locking it out would increase a country's 5G investment costs by between 8% and 29% due to reduced competition.And if mobile providers have to spend more, consumers can expect their bills to rise too.But one MP opposed to Huawei's rollout says there are more important considerations.""There's a free and fair competition element here, there's a security element, there's a data-privacy element, and there's a sort of geopolitics of Chinese influence as well - the influence of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Bob Seely, a member of the foreign affairs committee, told the BBC.""There shouldn't on principle be high-risk vendors in the communications network.""Huawei denies it uses state subsidies to undercut its rivals, adding that it would never spy on China's behalf or otherwise deliberately compromise its clients.Huawei is also a big player in fixed-line broadband.It currently accounts for about 44% of the equipment used in providing super-fast full-fibre connections directly to homes, office and other buildings, according to UK regulator Ofcom.BT's Openreach division aims to bring that in line with a 35% government target by using more kit from Nokia and the US firm Adtran.But this sidesteps the fact that more properties rely on an alternative set-up in which fibre only reaches roadside cabinets, and the last leg is supplied by a copper-based connection. The reason this is relevant is that tens of thousands of the cabinets involved are Huawei's.""They connect directly to the core of the network,"" commented Mr Ferguson.""But replacing those is a complete non-starter unless someone's going to throw many billions of pounds at it and also all the people to do the work."" While Huawei's opponents would prefer it to be gone altogether, they acknowledge this is impractical in the short term.But Mr Seely suggested that cabinets and other such products should be swapped out for alternatives when they are ""up for replacement"".One thing practically everyone agrees on is that the matter needs to be settled once and for at a time when so much else about the economy is uncertain.""These procurement decisions can take 18 months to two years to finalise and it takes time to ramp up supply to meet the demand,"" said Mr Howett.""So this isn't just a question of overnight deciding not to use Huawei - it would take many years to do it properly.""",26 May 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Hairdressers offer virtual appointments in lockdown,"Hairdressers have been offering virtual appointments to help people style their hair at home.Stylists are using apps including FaceTime, Zoom, and YouTube to provide customers live one-to-one advice and tutorials.While salons have already reopened in France and Germany, hairdressers in the UK expect to remain closed until July.An industry report estimated the hair and beauty sector contributed £6.6bn to the country's economy last year.Paul Phillips owns Chopp Hair salon in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, which shut in March when the coronavirus lockdown began.He provides a service called Chopp Drops, in which he delivers hair products to customers’ doorsteps and then demonstrates via video call how to apply the treatment.“Most hairdressers say you should never colour your hair at home, and in normal times I’d agree,” he says. “But lots of clients’ mental health has been affected by the current situation, so sorting out grey roots and split ends makes them feel better.”Paul says he serves up to 26 clients a day, but adds that he is cautious to only offer advice that is achievable at home.“It’s too technical to dye blonde hair, so those clients sadly have to sit tight and wait for the lockdown to be over,” he explains. “You don’t want somebody to mess up and then have to live with it for another seven weeks.”Most of the hairdressers the BBC spoke to offered bespoke hair kits and virtual appointments priced between £30 and £150.Ebuni Ajiduah is a hair loss-specialist. She has also moved her appointments online, offering clients home treatments, and when required referring them to dermatologists for further advice. “People now have the time to focus on things they may have neglected,” she says, adding that she’s seen an increased demand for her services.Ebuni has also launched a Virtual Wash Day every Sunday, when she invites people to join her on Zoom to wash, treat, and style hair together.“We talk about the products we use and how we twist our hair,” she says. “It’s really nice, you get some people in shower caps and others trying to keep their kids still.“It gives people a sense of normalcy when the world is on fire - you can still have a routine and focus time on yourself.”Some hairdressers advise against cutting your own hair but are still offering other tips online.“I've trimmed mine at the front but even I wouldn't attempt [to cut] mine at the back,” Michael Van Clarke says in a video on Instagram. Instead, he proceeds to show the audience how to style short hair that has grown out over a few weeks.Since closing its doors, the team from his salon has been posting videos on social media and booking virtual colour consultations, serving more than 3,000 customers online.“We have new clients which have never even been to our salon, the demand is huge,” Mr Van Clarke says. “It’s a lot easier to do the video consultations if we’ve seen them in person before, but we are still able to give advice to new customers.”Senior technicians carry out a hair assessment over an initial video call, advise on treatments and products, send them out and then offer a follow-up consultation to observe and guide the client.“Some people like their hands held for reassurance, so our technicians can show them how to hold the brush and how long to leave colour on for,” Mr Van Clarke adds.Gina Conway, who runs three salons in London, thinks this could become the ""new normal"".“Even when lockdown is over, it’s going to be chaos,” she explains. “Some people might not be able to afford to go to the salon, they might be working from home or looking after children still, so I hope we can relieve that stress through technology.”Gina says she’s now pivoting to focus on the internet.“At first I was hesitant as I wanted to keep my business as professional as possible, but this is our way of giving proper advice and helping people to feel good about themselves.”",25 May 2020,technology
How Coronavirus lockdown made a 'Zoom boom' generation,"I first realised just how quickly attitudes towards technology were changing when my mum told me, two days after lockdown began, that she had downloaded Skype.She's not exactly an early adopter - in fact, she has resolutely refused to video call anybody, ever, until now.Lockdown has removed the luxury of choice for many of us. If you want to see your relatives, it has to be on screen.As we get over the social awkwardness of the ""Zoom boom"" - when to mute that mic, when to stop talking - we're realising that, for the most part, video chat works. Whether it's family reunions, pub quizzes, office meetings or even pet appointments with the vet, we can get together quickly without being in the same room - and there's a good chance that is going to stick.Twitter has already told its staff they don't ever need to go back into the office again, and Cambridge University says its lectures will remain purely online until the summer of 2021. This week Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that up to 50% of the workforce could be working from home in the next 5-10 years. The tech giant's head of Virtual Reality, Andrew Bosworth, shared a fascinating video of what a mixed reality workspace - a combination of the real world and digital images - might look like.As we think through supercharging remote work and productivity, we've been working on mixed reality concepts that builds on existing technologies like Passthrough to allow people to switch between real and virtual worlds pic.twitter.com/cJCEXDxC7bEnd of Twitter post  by @boztankBroadly speaking the internet infrastructure has coped pretty well with everyone piling onto it - at least for those with access to more robust services.Some experts have long called for the net to be recognised as a public utility, alongside electricity, water and gas - as well as the requisite regulation that comes with it - and perhaps it has finally earned its spurs. John Graham-Cumming, from internet security firm Cloudflare, said the company is now seeing three daily peaks for internet traffic around the world - first thing in the morning, lunchtime and early evening - and they are bigger than ever.""If you think about the internet as a utility, can you think of another utility that could sustain 50% growth [in traffic]?"" he said.""The net has been a reliable sidekick through all this."" And the tech firms have certainly spotted their opportunity. Microsoft's Satya Nadella says digital transformation has advanced two years in two months, as we seek to be entertained, to be connected and to keep track of what is happening during the pandemic.We can already see investment and goodwill getting behind tech alternatives in the hunt for new ways of doing things: could this be the moment drone deliveries finally take off (pardon the pun), e-scooters get an easier ride, and virtual gyms put our post-lockdown bodies through their paces, via a headset, in the comfort of our own homes?History will eventually reveal whether lockdown was the dawn of a new era or merely a blip before things returned to the way they were.For tech to truly prove itself as a game-changer, it has to become part of the furniture: consistent, reliable and, therefore, totally unremarkable.

Facebook dominates cases of recorded social media grooming,"Police in England and Wales recorded more than 10,000 online grooming offences on social media over two-and-a-half years.Where the method was recorded, more than half - 55% - took place on a Facebook-owned app.The figures come from freedom of information requests lodged by child protection charity the NSPCC. It is calling for the government to introduce stronger protections, warning that the rate of offences is rising.Just under a quarter of recorded offences - 23% - took place in the six months to October last year, the most recent period for which data is available.The data covers the first 30 months since the introduction of a law that made sexual communication with a child an explicit offence. In that time, police in the two nations recorded 10,119 offences. But police only recorded the platform used in 5,784 of those cases.Of those, more than half took place on a Facebook platform - including Facebook itself, its messenger app, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Instagram was the most common method among the Facebook-owned app, with 1,630 recorded offences - 16% of the total. Of 5,784 reports where the method of communication was recorded by policeThe NSPCC has previously warned that Facebook's shift to tightly encrypted messaging would aid offenders, and shareholders recently tried to block its plans for encryption on that basis.A Facebook spokesperson said: ""There is no place for grooming or child exploitation on our platforms, and we use technology to proactively find and quickly remove it.""We have a content and security team of over 35,000 people investigating reports from our community and working to keep our platforms safe. Our teams also work closely with child protection experts and law enforcement, reporting content directly to specialists.""Another 1,060 offences (18%) were recorded as taking place on Snapchat, owned by Snap Inc. It also said the exploitation of young people is absolutely unacceptable, and that eliminating such abuse was a priority for the company. The rest of the cases were made up of small numbers of cases across dozens of other platforms such as text messaging, online gaming, or websites.Because the data begins in early 2017 and runs to October 2019, it may not account for the most recent trends in platforms that young people use.The NSPCC says its information demonstrates the need for new regulation, and warned that the coronavirus lockdown had created ""a perfect storm for abusers"".It is calling for the government to push ahead with the proposed Online Harms Bill within 18 months.NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground in which to groom our kids.""Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.""",29 May 2020,technology
Trump signs executive order targeting Twitter after fact-checking row,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at removing some of the legal protections given to social media platforms.He said the firms had ""unchecked power"" to censure and edit the views of users.President Trump has regularly accused platforms such as Twitter and Facebook of stifling conservative voices.The order, which is expected to face legal challenges, comes after Twitter decided to append fact-check labels to two of his tweets this week.On Wednesday Mr Trump accused the company of election interference after it added a warning label to the tweets about claims of widespread fraud in mail-in voting - also known as postal votes.Twitter and other social media platforms strongly condemned the executive order.And early on Friday, Twitter hid one of President Trump's tweets from his profile, saying it violates rules about glorifying violence.Under a 1996 law, website operators, unlike traditional publishers, cannot generally be held responsible for content posted by users.The sites are also protected from lawsuits if they block posts deemed obscene, violent ""or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected"".The executive order argues that this immunity should no longer apply if a social network edits posts, such as by adding a warning or a label. It also says ""deceptive"" blocking, including removing a post for reasons other than those described in a website's terms of service, should not be protected.Republican Senator Marco Rubio is among those arguing that the platforms take on the role of a ""publisher"" when they add fact-check labels to posts.""The law still protects social media companies like Twitter because they are considered forums not publishers,"" Mr Rubio said.""But if they have now decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher, then they should no longer be shielded from liability."" The executive order also calls for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to spell out what type of content blocking will be considered deceptive or inconsistent with a service provider's terms and conditions.Donald Trump promised ""big action"" in response to Twitter's decision to append a fact-check message to two of his posts.

If Twitter itself start blunting one of his favourite communication tools, he is sending a message that he will push back - and make things, at a minimum, uncomfortable for the company.Twitter called the order ""a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law,"" adding that Section 230 ""protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it's underpinned by democratic values"".Google, which owns YouTube, said changing Section 230 would ""hurt America's economy and its global leadership on internet freedom.""""Our platforms have empowered a wide range of people and organizations from across the political spectrum, giving them a voice and new ways to reach their audiences,"" the firm said in a statement to the BBC.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a social media platform would not be the ""right reflex"" for a government concerned about censorship. ""I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. The long-running dispute between Mr Trump and social media companies flared up again on Tuesday, when two of his posts were given a fact-check label by Twitter for the first time.He had tweeted, without providing evidence: ""There is no way (zero) that mail-in ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.""Twitter added a warning label to the post and linked to a page describing the claims as ""unsubstantiated"".Then on Wednesday, Mr Trump threatened to ""strongly regulate"" social-media platforms.He tweeted to his more than 80 million followers that Republicans felt the platforms ""totally silence conservatives"", and that he would not allow this to happen. In an earlier tweet, he said Twitter was ""completely stifling free speech"".Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, responded to criticism of the platform's fact-checking policies in a series of posts, saying: ""We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally.""Fact check: there is someone ultimately accountable for our actions as a company, and that’s me. Please leave our employees out of this. We’ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make.End of Twitter post  by @jackTwitter has tightened its policies in recent years, as it faced criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.",29 May 2020,technology
