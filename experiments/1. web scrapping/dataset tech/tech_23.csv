Call of Duty: Modern Warfare fix causes Xbox owners more headaches,"The makers of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare say they have ""resolved"" a problem that caused updates to the video game to be more than twice the size they should have been.But several players who have tried to take advantage of the fix have reported being worse off as a consequence.The initial issue led some Xboxes to start downloading an 85 gigabyte file that should have been about 40GB.And some who cancelled this to try again have lost their main game file.As a consequence they have had to download the entire title from scratch, entailing a download of more than 100GB.In theory it should take about four hours to download a file of that size on an average UK home broadband connection.In practice, however, it takes much longer, because the data cannot be downloaded at the maximum speed if there are too many people trying to do so at once.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's Season 4 update introduces new weapons, narrative video scenes, maps and bug fixes to Activision's first-person shooter.Once downloaded, it takes up only 4GB more storage than the previous version on the hard drive. Even so, some players have expressed concern at the amount of disc space they are having to give up - as the game has had one of the largest file sizes among mainstream games since its release last year.On Sony's PlayStation 4, the installed game can now take up close to 200GB in total - about half disc space available on the basic version. Owners can, however, delete some of the modes they do not play to free up storage for other games and media.The update was originally scheduled to have been made available on 3 June but developer Infinity Ward said it had been held back until now to allow people to focus on voices calling for ""equality, justice and change"" as part of the US protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd.Activision said the latest version of Modern Warfare had been its bestselling Call of Duty game to date, during a recent analysts briefing. The company makes money from each season update as players can pay a fee to unlock new content rather than having to spend hours earning it via a series of in-game achievements.",11 June 2020,technology
PimEyes facial recognition website 'could be used by stalkers',"A free facial recognition tool that allows people to find pictures of themselves or others from around the internet has drawn criticism from privacy campaigners.PimEyes describes itself as a privacy tool to help prevent misuse of images.But Big Brother Watch said it could ""enable state surveillance, commercial monitoring and even stalking on a scale previously unimaginable"".It comes as Amazon decides to pause its use of facial recognition for a year.Polish website PimEyes was set up in 2017 as a hobby project, and commercialised last year. It currently has 6,000 users signed up.Attention was drawn to it following an article published on Medium.The website allows people to upload any picture for free and it will then find matching images from around the web, drawing on publicly accessible sites such as Tumblr, news outlets and blogs.Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, told the BBC: ""To see this powerful surveillance tech marketed to individuals is chilling. It's ripe for stalking and puts women and children at unprecedented risk.""In response, PimEyes said: ""Our privacy policy prevents people from using our tool for this case. Every tool could be used in the wrong way.""It told the BBC that it categorically did not use images scraped from social media, despite the BBC finding pictures of its reporters that had been uploaded to Facebook and Twitter.""If you found faces which were posted only on Facebook that means that someone else has posted it somewhere else. We crawl only websites that agree in their rules for crawling,"" it said in an email.Using social media images has got facial recognition firm ClearviewAI into trouble. It amassed more than three billion photographs from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which are used by the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and 600 other law enforcement agencies around the world to identify suspects.All three social networks have asked it  to stop doing so. PimEyes offers a premium service that allows people to input up to 25 images of different people and get alerts whenever new photos are uploaded online. Currently it has 350 active users of this service.It told the BBC that the premise of the website was to help individuals ""fight for their own online privacy"", including finding fake profiles, leaked images and unauthorised photo usage.It acknowledged that it did work with police forces, feeding into Paliscope, a software tool used by law enforcement agents.But it has removed a reference on its website about searching the dark web for the police.According to PimEye's website, images uploaded to the site are ""never saved or indexed"". Instead it says it uses a fingerprint of a face - the main features - which is encoded and temporarily saved on its servers.Facial recognition technology has become increasingly controversial as more police forces around the world adopt the tools. Several studies question how accurate the technology is, suggesting that it performs particularly poorly when identifying black people.In the wake of protests over the killing of George Floyd and calls for police reform, IBM and Amazon have both stopped the use of facial recognition technology.In Amazon's case, police use of its Rekognition software has been paused for a year to allow the US government to decide how it wants the technology to be used in future.",11 June 2020,technology
Coronavirus: Ministers consider NHS contact-tracing app rethink,"Concerns about the risks of deploying a go-it-alone UK coronavirus contact-tracing app are causing further delays.A second version of the smartphone software was due to have begun testing on the Isle of Wight on Tuesday, but the government decided to postpone the trial.Ministers are considering switching the app over to tech developed by Apple and Google.But countries testing that model are experiencing issues of their own.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said the NHS Covid-19 app was to be launched across England - and possibly other parts of the UK - by 1 June.But he subsequently said the government had decided it would be better to establish a network of human contact tracers first.However, the BBC has discovered that one of the main reasons the initiative is running behind schedule is that developers are having problems using Bluetooth as a means to estimate distance.Even so, they still believe they are better placed to tackle the challenge than counterparts overseas who are working under constraints imposed by the two US tech firms.Contact-tracing apps are designed to prevent a second wave of infections by keeping a log of when two people are in close proximity to each other and for how long.If one of the users later tests positive for the disease, the records are used to determine how likely it is they infected the other. If required, an alert is triggered to help prevent the further spread of the virus.The UK has adopted what is known as a ""centralised"" approach, meaning that the contact-matching process is carried out on a remote computer server. One benefit is it offers epidemiologists more data to tackle the pandemic. France and India are other countries to have adopted this model.By contrast, Apple and Google's ""decentralised"" approach carries out the matches on the handsets themselves, on the grounds this better protects users' privacy.Poland switched its app from a centralised to decentralised approach on Tuesday. Switzerland, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Latvia are among others to have adopted the tech giants' design.Both systems rely on Bluetooth ""handshakes"" to work.Number 10 is concerned that iPhones will not always detect each other because of a restriction Apple has imposed on apps that do not adopt its model.But the UK team has devised a workaround and is more concerned about other limitations of using Bluetooth.Some of these issues were outlined in a study published by Trinity College Dublin last month.It highlighted problems with using received Bluetooth signal strength as a means to estimate distance.Researchers warned signal strength ""can vary substantially"" depending on:The report highlighted troubling results when Singapore's TraceTogether app was tested.An experiment within a stationary train carriage found that when users moved from a distance of 3.5m (11.5ft) to 4m, signals became stronger rather than weaker because of the way metal objects were reflecting the radio waves. A trial in a supermarket also found the received signal strength was the same whether two people were walking close together or 2m apart.Follow-up tests using Apple-Google's tech are currently under way.""The work is ongoing, but preliminary results are broadly consistent with previous observations,"" said Dr Brendan Jennings, who has been tasked with assessing the effectiveness of Ireland's Covid-19 app.The team behind Switzerland's SwissCovid app is carrying out tests of its own.Its Bluetooth measurement chief believes the issue can be partly addressed by taking a range of readings over a period of five minutes or more.But he added that Apple and Google had placed curbs on what could be achieved.""The Google and Apple API [application programming interface] limits the amount of raw information that is actually exposed to the app,"" Prof Mathias Payer told the BBC.""For maximum utility, we would get all the different measurements, but this has privacy implications.""Apps using Google and Apple's tech do not get to see the actual signal strength but rather one of three values, based on calculations used to normalise the different ways Bluetooth behaves on different handsets,By contrast, the UK team can currently obtain the measurements directly. Those responsible believe a further advantage of their centralised approach is that the data can be processed on the server involved, since it would be too taxing a task to be done on smartphones.But part of their challenge is communicating this to Baroness Dido Harding -  who heads up the wider Test and Trace programme - and 10 Downing Street itself.A spokesman for the prime minister declined to comment.",11 June 2020,technology
'How my photo ended up breaking Android phones',"Gaurav Agrawal, a scientist and amateur photographer living in San Diego, couldn't believe it when he suddenly started seeing a photograph he took last summer popping up on the news.He took it at St Mary Lake in Glacier National Park, Montana, one ""magical evening"" in August 2019.He shared the snap on photo platform Flickr and thought no more about it.However, a glitch meant that when the image was set as wallpaper, it caused some Android phones to fail.The handsets would switch on and off repeatedly, requiring a factory reset which meant all data on them was wiped.  Last week, a tweet about the bug went viral - and Mr Agrawal contacted me.""I didn't do anything intentionally,"" he said. ""I'm sad that people ended up having issues."" It seems to happen on some but not all brands of phones running Version 10 of the Android operating system. It is not advisable to test it out.""It was a magical evening,"" Mr Agrawal told the BBC of the night he took the photo, in the park with his wife. It was their third trip there, in pursuit of the perfect picture.""It was gloomy and cloudy, and we thought there wasn't going to be a great sunset. We were about to leave when things started to change.""He grabbed the shot on his Nikon camera, and later did a small edit using the editing software Lightroom.And that's where the bug crept in.Lightroom gives three colour-mode options for exporting the finished result - and the one he picked is the one that seems to confuse some Android handsets. He was unaware of the glitch because he had never tried it.""I didn't know the format would do this,"" he said. ""I have an iPhone, and my wallpaper is always a photo of my wife.""Mr Agrawal has over 10,000 followers on the photography platform Flickr and has had his work published by National Geographic magazine.""I hoped my photograph would have gone 'viral' for a good reason, but maybe that's for another time,"" he said.""I'm going to use another format from now on.""For those who do not know the background, Ken Munro and Dave Lodge from security firm Pen Test partners have an explanation of what went wrong: ""As digital photographs have improved in quality, phones need to check what the image 'colour space' is to work out how to display it properly. ""It's how a phone knows how to display exactly the right shade of green, for example.""There are different ways of defining the colour space. Some spaces have specialist uses in graphic design, so sometimes you'll see images that aren't in the usual 'Standard RGB' format. It's also possible to deliberately create images that have more colour information than some devices can handle. ""What's happened here is that the way some phones deal with these cases has gone wrong. ""The phone crashes because it doesn't know how to deal with it correctly, and the software developers probably hadn't considered this might happen.""",10 June 2020,technology

Ron Johnson, who was head of consumer products at Riot Games, shared an image detailing Mr Floyd's criminal record.He wrote that it was ""no reason to condone his killing"" but added: ""This type of criminal lifestyle never results in good things.""Riot Games said the Facebook post was ""abhorrent"" and told staff Mr Johnson had exercised ""poor judgment"".The Los Angeles-based firm produces the hugely popular League Of Legends video game and the newly released shooter Valorant.On 5 June, the company pledged to donate $1m (£790,000) to ""accelerate progress"" against racism, amid protests following the death of Mr Floyd.The protests began following the release of a video showing African-American George Floyd being arrested in Minneapolis.In the video, a white police officer is seen kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck even after he pleads that he cannot breathe.Mr Floyd's death has sparked huge protests across the US against racism and the police killings of black Americans.Mr Johnson posted a copy of an image that has been widely shared online. It shows a photo of George Floyd with text saying: ""The media and the left have made George Floyd into a martyr. But who was he really?""It lists several previous convictions and alleges Mr Floyd was ""high on meth getting ready to drive a car and possibly kill your kid"" at the time of his arrest.Mr Johnson added his own caption, stating: ""This is no reason to condone his killing by the officer at all, which still needs to be investigated as a potential crime.""It is a learning opportunity for people (and your kids) to teach that this type of criminal lifestyle never results in good things happening to you or those around you.""On Wednesday, Riot Games placed Mr Johnson on leave to launch an investigation.It said the post was ""abhorrent, against our values, and directly counter to our belief that addressing systemic racism requires immediate societal change"".On Thursday, the company confirmed in an internal email seen by ESPN that Mr Johnson had resigned.""We must respect that everyone is entitled to their own political views,"" wrote Riot Games chief executive Nicolo Laurent.""I believe Ron exercised really poor judgment here. It resulted in a post that was harmful to many of us and our broader community. It was insensitive and in this moment, it undermines the commitment we've made to stand against all acts of injustice, racism, prejudice, and hate.""Ron understands this and recognises that he will be ineffective as a leader at Riot going forward. As a result, he has resigned, effective today.""",12 June 2020,technology
