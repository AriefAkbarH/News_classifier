Climate change: May was sunniest calendar month on record in UK,"May was the sunniest calendar month on record, and spring was the sunniest spring, the Met Office has said.The UK enjoyed 266 hours of sunshine in May - surpassing the previous record of 265 hours in June 1957.And it is even more extraordinary following a drenching winter, with record rain in February. Meteorologists say they are amazed at the sudden switch from extreme wet to extreme dry – it is not ""British"" weather.On average the UK gets 436 hours of sunshine between March and the end of May.Since 1929, only 10 years have had more than 500 hours. And none has got more than 555 hours. Scientists say the recent weather in the UK has been unprecedented and astounding. This year we've bathed in an extraordinary 626 hours - smashing the previous record by a “staggering” amount, one Met Office worker said.It is because the jet stream has locked the fine weather in place, just as it locked the previous winter rainfall in place. Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, told BBC News: “We’ve swung from a really unsettled spell with weather systems coming in off the Atlantic to a very, very settled spell.“It’s unprecedented to see such a swing from one extreme to the other in such a short space of time. That’s what concerns me. We don’t see these things normally happening with our seasons. “It’s part of a pattern where we’re experiencing increasingly extreme weather as the climate changes.”Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office, said: “If we look at the difference in rainfall that’s fallen over the winter compared to spring it is the largest difference in rainfall amount in our national series from 1862.“The sunshine statistics are really astounding.“The stand out is by how much sunshine has broken the previous record - set in 1948. There’s been more sunshine than most of our past summer seasons. It's quite remarkable.""

Some of them believe the rapid man-made heating of the Arctic, which has led to record temperatures and wildfires in Siberia, may be influencing the jet stream, although that is not proven.Professor Joe Smith, chief executive of the Royal Geographical Society, told BBC News: ""For many people, the recent long sunny spell is simply 'nice weather'.

Climate change: older trees loss continue around the world,"Older, carbon-rich tropical forests continue to be lost at a frightening rate, according to satellite data. In 2019, an area of primary forest the size of a football pitch was lost every six seconds, the University of Maryland study of trees more than 5 metres says.Brazil accounted for a third of it, its worst loss in 13 years apart from huge spikes in 2016 and 2017 from fires.However, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo both managed to reduce tree loss.Meanwhile, Australia saw a sixfold rise in total tree loss, following dramatic wildfires late in 2019, .As well as storing massive amounts of carbon, primary, tropical rainforests, where trees can be hundreds or even thousands of years old, are home to species such as orangutans and tigers.The tropics lost 11.9 million hectares (46,000 square miles) of tree cover, the study found, 3.8 million in older, primary forest areas - the third highest loss of primary trees since 2000 and a slight increase on 2018.""The level of forest loss that we saw in 2019 is unacceptable,"" Frances Seymour, from the World Resources Institute, said. ""And one of the reasons that it's unacceptable is that we actually already know how to turn it around.""If governments put into place good policies and enforce the law, forest loss goes down. ""But if governments relax restrictions on burning, or [are] signalling that they intend to open up indigenous territories for commercial exploration, forest loss goes up.""Speaking about the losses in Brazil, Mikaela Weisse, from Global Forest Watch, said: ""We also noted several new hotspots of primary forest loss within indigenous territories, especially in the state of Pará that were linked to land grabbing and to mining.""These incursions are particularly worrisome given that indigenous peoples have been some of the best conservers of forests in Brazil and around the world.""Indonesia, however, saw losses remain at historically low levels for the third year in a row, thanks, it seems, to strong government action.Liz Goldman, from Global Forest Watch, said: ""A number of policies in Indonesia have contributed to this positive story, including increased enforcement to prevent forest fires and land clearing and a forest moratorium to prevent new clearing for oil palm plantations and logging activities, which was first established in 2011 and made permanent just this past year."" And Columbia, which had seen tree losses surge since a peace agreement came into force in 2016, saw a 35% drop in primary forest loss compared with 2018.But Bolivia saw losses 80% greater than any other year, after fires set for agricultural clearing spread out of control.And nearly 12% of the Chiquitano dry forest, in eastern Bolivia, home to indigenous peoples, jaguars, giant armadillos and tapirs, was burned.

Extinction crisis 'poses existential threat to civilisation',"Human impacts on the places on Earth with the most richness of life have brought hundreds of wild animals to the brink of extinction, a study shows.The likes of logging and poaching have pushed 500 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians to the point where they're hanging by a thread, research found.This is yet more evidence that the world's undergoing a sixth mass extinction, scientists argue.Species are disappearing at more than 100 times the natural rate, they say. And unlike other mass extinctions, caused by volcano eruptions or asteroid collisions, we only have ourselves to blame.Prof Gerardo Ceballos of the National University of Mexico in Mexico City, said regional ecosystems are facing collapse. ""We have entered the sixth mass extinction,"" he told BBC News. ""Based on our research and what we're seeing, the extinction crisis is so bad that whatever we do in the next 10 to 50 years is what will define the future of humanity.""Prof Ceballos worked on the study with two other well-known conservation scientists, Stanford University's Prof Paul Erhlich, and Dr Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St Louis, US.Using data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened species and Birdlife (the bird authority for the IUCN), they identified at least 515 species that are on the brink of extinction, with fewer than a thousand individuals left. The animals are found on every continent save Antarctica, in places highly impacted by humans, primarily in the tropics and subtropics.They include the Golden Lion Tamarin, Ethiopian Wolf, Javan Rhinoceros, Spanish Imperial Eagle, Yellow-eared Parrot, Gharial and Green Poison Frog.The scientists describe the extinction crisis as an existential threat to civilisation, along with climate change and pollution, to which it is tied.And they say they have a ""moral imperative"" to draw attention to the loss of biodiversity, which they say is still rather ignored by most people.The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Commenting, Prof Diana Fisher of the University of Queensland, Australia, said the study deserved attention because so many people don't realise how much of the world's wildlife faces impending extinction. ""I agree with the authors that this extinction crisis needs to be elevated to an emergency equal to climate change,"" she said.Prof Chris Johnson of the University of Tasmania said the current rate of extinction of species is higher than at any time since 66 million years ago, when the collision of a space-rock with the Earth killed off dinosaurs and many other species. ""Threats to species in today's world - things like habitat destruction and climate change - are growing rapidly,"" he said, adding that the 515 species down to 1,000 or fewer individuals are likely to be gone very soon.  And Prof Euan Ritchie of Deakin University in Australia said the study ""is yet more dire confirmation that we are destroying life at a horrific pace and scale"".Follow Helen on Twitter.",2 June 2020,science
SpaceX Nasa Mission: Astronauts on historic mission enter space station,"US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have docked with, and entered, the International Space Station (ISS).Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - attached to the bow section of the orbiting lab 422km above China.After a wait for leak, pressure and temperature checks, the pair disembarked to join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS.Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday.Theirs is the first crew outing launched from American soil to orbit since the retirement of the US space agency (Nasa) shuttles nine years ago.

No more will it own and operate the American vehicles that run to and from the station.This will be done exclusively by firms such as SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk.Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST) on Sunday, 19 hours after leaving the Kennedy Space Center atop a Falcon rocket also provided by SpaceX.The docking was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach. The doors between Dragon and the ISS were opened at 17:02 GMT (18:02 BST). When Hurley and Behnken floated through, they were met by ISS Commander and fellow Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.""We're just happy to be here and Chris is going to put us work. And hopefully we will fit in and not mess too many things up,"" said Doug Hurley as he nursed a bruise picked up on his forehead. Bob Behnken said the pair were well rested and ready for the tasks ahead.""We did get probably a good seven hours or so (of sleep),"" he said in a radio link with mission control in Houston, Texas. ""The first night is always a little bit of a challenge, but the Dragon was a slick vehicle, and we had good air flow and so we had an excellent evening. (We're) just excited to be back in low-Earth orbit again.""Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine congratulated the duo on a job well done: ""The whole world saw this mission and we are so, so proud of everything you've done for our country and, in fact, to inspire the world.""SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans.Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers.SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract, which will encompass six astronaut ""taxi"" flights, with the first of these likely to occur at the end of August. Hurley's and Behnken's arrival at the ISS means they get to claim a Stars and Stripes flag placed on the platform by the members of the very last space shuttle mission in 2011.The Atlantis orbiter's crew left this flag as an incentive to all those that came after them. The flag, which also flew on the very first shuttle flight in 1981, will now be returned to Earth to be given to the mission that next goes beyond Earth orbit.  Earlier, Hurley and Behnken named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it ""Endeavour"", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s.It's somewhat uncertain how long Hurley and Behnken will stay at the ISS, but perhaps as much as four months.In that time, they will become members of the current ISS Expedition 63 crew, taking part in the platform's everyday science and maintenance activities.Chris Cassidy joked that because his new crewmates arrived on a Sunday, they had missed the cleaning chores that normally take place on a Saturday.

Climate change: older trees loss continue around the world,"Older, carbon-rich tropical forests continue to be lost at a frightening rate, according to satellite data. In 2019, an area of primary forest the size of a football pitch was lost every six seconds, the University of Maryland study of trees more than 5 metres says.Brazil accounted for a third of it, its worst loss in 13 years apart from huge spikes in 2016 and 2017 from fires.However, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo both managed to reduce tree loss.Meanwhile, Australia saw a sixfold rise in total tree loss, following dramatic wildfires late in 2019, .As well as storing massive amounts of carbon, primary, tropical rainforests, where trees can be hundreds or even thousands of years old, are home to species such as orangutans and tigers.The tropics lost 11.9 million hectares (46,000 square miles) of tree cover, the study found, 3.8 million in older, primary forest areas - the third highest loss of primary trees since 2000 and a slight increase on 2018.""The level of forest loss that we saw in 2019 is unacceptable,"" Frances Seymour, from the World Resources Institute, said. ""And one of the reasons that it's unacceptable is that we actually already know how to turn it around.""If governments put into place good policies and enforce the law, forest loss goes down. ""But if governments relax restrictions on burning, or [are] signalling that they intend to open up indigenous territories for commercial exploration, forest loss goes up.""Speaking about the losses in Brazil, Mikaela Weisse, from Global Forest Watch, said: ""We also noted several new hotspots of primary forest loss within indigenous territories, especially in the state of Pará that were linked to land grabbing and to mining.""These incursions are particularly worrisome given that indigenous peoples have been some of the best conservers of forests in Brazil and around the world.""Indonesia, however, saw losses remain at historically low levels for the third year in a row, thanks, it seems, to strong government action.Liz Goldman, from Global Forest Watch, said: ""A number of policies in Indonesia have contributed to this positive story, including increased enforcement to prevent forest fires and land clearing and a forest moratorium to prevent new clearing for oil palm plantations and logging activities, which was first established in 2011 and made permanent just this past year."" And Columbia, which had seen tree losses surge since a peace agreement came into force in 2016, saw a 35% drop in primary forest loss compared with 2018.But Bolivia saw losses 80% greater than any other year, after fires set for agricultural clearing spread out of control.And nearly 12% of the Chiquitano dry forest, in eastern Bolivia, home to indigenous peoples, jaguars, giant armadillos and tapirs, was burned.

Extinction crisis 'poses existential threat to civilisation',"Human impacts on the places on Earth with the most richness of life have brought hundreds of wild animals to the brink of extinction, a study shows.The likes of logging and poaching have pushed 500 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians to the point where they're hanging by a thread, research found.This is yet more evidence that the world's undergoing a sixth mass extinction, scientists argue.Species are disappearing at more than 100 times the natural rate, they say. And unlike other mass extinctions, caused by volcano eruptions or asteroid collisions, we only have ourselves to blame.Prof Gerardo Ceballos of the National University of Mexico in Mexico City, said regional ecosystems are facing collapse. ""We have entered the sixth mass extinction,"" he told BBC News. ""Based on our research and what we're seeing, the extinction crisis is so bad that whatever we do in the next 10 to 50 years is what will define the future of humanity.""Prof Ceballos worked on the study with two other well-known conservation scientists, Stanford University's Prof Paul Erhlich, and Dr Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St Louis, US.Using data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened species and Birdlife (the bird authority for the IUCN), they identified at least 515 species that are on the brink of extinction, with fewer than a thousand individuals left. The animals are found on every continent save Antarctica, in places highly impacted by humans, primarily in the tropics and subtropics.They include the Golden Lion Tamarin, Ethiopian Wolf, Javan Rhinoceros, Spanish Imperial Eagle, Yellow-eared Parrot, Gharial and Green Poison Frog.The scientists describe the extinction crisis as an existential threat to civilisation, along with climate change and pollution, to which it is tied.And they say they have a ""moral imperative"" to draw attention to the loss of biodiversity, which they say is still rather ignored by most people.The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Commenting, Prof Diana Fisher of the University of Queensland, Australia, said the study deserved attention because so many people don't realise how much of the world's wildlife faces impending extinction. ""I agree with the authors that this extinction crisis needs to be elevated to an emergency equal to climate change,"" she said.Prof Chris Johnson of the University of Tasmania said the current rate of extinction of species is higher than at any time since 66 million years ago, when the collision of a space-rock with the Earth killed off dinosaurs and many other species. ""Threats to species in today's world - things like habitat destruction and climate change - are growing rapidly,"" he said, adding that the 515 species down to 1,000 or fewer individuals are likely to be gone very soon.  And Prof Euan Ritchie of Deakin University in Australia said the study ""is yet more dire confirmation that we are destroying life at a horrific pace and scale"".Follow Helen on Twitter.",2 June 2020,science
SpaceX Nasa Mission: Astronauts on historic mission enter space station,"US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have docked with, and entered, the International Space Station (ISS).Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - attached to the bow section of the orbiting lab 422km above China.After a wait for leak, pressure and temperature checks, the pair disembarked to join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS.Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday.Theirs is the first crew outing launched from American soil to orbit since the retirement of the US space agency (Nasa) shuttles nine years ago. This is the first time in human history @NASA_Astronauts have entered the @Space_Station from a commercially-made spacecraft. @AstroBehnken and @Astro_Doug have finally arrived to the orbiting laboratory in @SpaceX's Dragon Endeavour spacecraft. pic.twitter.com/3t9Ogtpik4End of Twitter post  by @NASAThe mission marks the beginning of a new era in which Nasa will be purchasing transport services from the commercial sector. No more will it own and operate the American vehicles that run to and from the station.This will be done exclusively by firms such as SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk.Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST) on Sunday, 19 hours after leaving the Kennedy Space Center atop a Falcon rocket also provided by SpaceX.The docking was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach. The doors between Dragon and the ISS were opened at 17:02 GMT (18:02 BST). When Hurley and Behnken floated through, they were met by ISS Commander and fellow Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.""We're just happy to be here and Chris is going to put us work. And hopefully we will fit in and not mess too many things up,"" said Doug Hurley as he nursed a bruise picked up on his forehead. Bob Behnken said the pair were well rested and ready for the tasks ahead.""We did get probably a good seven hours or so (of sleep),"" he said in a radio link with mission control in Houston, Texas. ""The first night is always a little bit of a challenge, but the Dragon was a slick vehicle, and we had good air flow and so we had an excellent evening. (We're) just excited to be back in low-Earth orbit again.""Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine congratulated the duo on a job well done: ""The whole world saw this mission and we are so, so proud of everything you've done for our country and, in fact, to inspire the world.""SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans.Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers.SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract, which will encompass six astronaut ""taxi"" flights, with the first of these likely to occur at the end of August. Hurley's and Behnken's arrival at the ISS means they get to claim a Stars and Stripes flag placed on the platform by the members of the very last space shuttle mission in 2011.The Atlantis orbiter's crew left this flag as an incentive to all those that came after them. The flag, which also flew on the very first shuttle flight in 1981, will now be returned to Earth to be given to the mission that next goes beyond Earth orbit.  Earlier, Hurley and Behnken named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it ""Endeavour"", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s.It's somewhat uncertain how long Hurley and Behnken will stay at the ISS, but perhaps as much as four months.In that time, they will become members of the current ISS Expedition 63 crew, taking part in the platform's everyday science and maintenance activities.Chris Cassidy joked that because his new crewmates arrived on a Sunday, they had missed the cleaning chores that normally take place on a Saturday.

SpaceX launch: Nasa astronauts begin historic mission on private spaceship,"The private rocket company SpaceX has sent two Nasa astronauts into orbit.It's the first time since the retirement of the shuttles nine years ago that an American crew has made the journey from US territory.Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are not only trialling a new capsule system, they are also initiating a new business model for Nasa.The agency will no longer own the vehicles it uses but merely purchase the ""taxi"" service offered by SpaceX.It's hoped companies other than tech billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX outfit will come in to expand the market. The aerospace giant Boeing already has a contract with Nasa to do so. Mr Musk himself said he was overcome with emotion watching his hardware take the astronauts to orbit. ""I think this is something that should get people right in the heart, of anyone that has the spirit of exploration. And the US is the distillation of the spirit of exploration,"" he told reporters.The new capability the CEO is offering will end the reliance of Nasa on Russian rockets and capsules to get its people to the International Space Station (ISS).It was a point picked up on by President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch the launch.""Past leaders put the US at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore,"" he said. ""Today we once again proudly launched American astronauts on American rockets - the best in the world - from right here on American soil.""Hurley's and Behnken's Dragon ship left Earth atop its Falcon-9 rocket precisely on time - at 15:22 EDT (19:22 GMT / 20:22 BST).Meteorologists had forecast only a 50:50 chance of favourable conditions around Florida's Kennedy Space Center at lift-off, but, as luck would have it, the weather window stayed open and the SpaceX controllers grabbed their opportunity.The Falcon soared off the spaceport's famous 39A pad to head northeast out over the Atlantic. After two-and-a-half minutes, the lower-stage of the vehicle had separated to return to a drone ship at sea. And after a further six minutes, the crew were safely inserted into orbit. Hurley and Behnken are set to arrive at the ISS on Sunday.They'll use some of the intervening hours to test equipment and procedures in their capsule, including doing some manual flying. Although the Dragon capsule is a fully automated vehicle capable of finding its own way to the ISS, the crew needs to prepare for all eventualities and that means knowing exactly how the ship will behave in their hands.Uniquely, the Dragon has no control stick; all flight commands must be entered via a touchscreen panel.One of their first tasks in orbit was simply to name their ship - in the tradition of past US spacefarers, all the way back to the Mercury programme. Radioing down to Earth, they announced it would be called Endeavour. Doug Hurley said: ""We chose Endeavour for a few reasons: One, because of this incredible endeavour that Nasa, SpaceX and the US have been on since the end of the shuttle programme back in 2011. The other reason is a little more personal to Bob and I. We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour and it just meant so much to us to carry on that name.""Endeavour was the ship commanded by British explorer James Cook on his voyage to Australia in the late 18th Century.The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay at the ISS is uncertain, but is likely to be somewhere between one and four months. Assuming their return to a splashdown in the Atlantic is as smooth as the launch, Nasa and SpaceX will move directly into the full terms of their new relationship.The company has a $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract with the agency to fly six operational crew missions to the ISS. The first of these should occur at the end August, or very soon after; and will see four astronauts climb aboard a Dragon rather than just the two we saw on this occasion.Saturday's launch went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the spaceport.As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with in the weeks running up to launch, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks.For SpaceX, Saturday marked another significant milestone for the company which was founded just 18 years ago.The firm has upended the launcher industry with its reusable vehicles and is now pioneering a new market-driven approach to human spaceflight.It hasn't all been plain sailing - as evidenced by a spectacular explosion at the  firm's prototyping facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on Friday. But the company has routinely proved naysayers wrong, and Nasa believes its relationship with Elon Musk will save billion of dollars that can be diverted to the more complex task of getting people back to the Moon and then to Mars.    ""We want to establish a commercial environment in low-Earth orbit so that we can focus on the hard job of exploring beyond our home planet, to establish a sustained presence on the Moon and get to Mars to establish a presence there,"" said Bob Cabana, the director at Kennedy.  ""We can't do that if we're locked here in low-Earth orbit, and commercial crew - that's the beginning of a whole new era of spaceflight.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",30 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: How we got to this point,"Elon Musk's SpaceX has launched people to the space station. But why is a private company sending astronauts into space for Nasa?To understand the background to this historic launch with the Crew Dragon spacecraft, we need to go back almost 20 years to a tragic accident.On 1 February 2003, the space shuttle Columbia broke apart while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. All seven astronauts aboard perished in the disaster.The loss of Columbia and its crew was the trigger for a dramatic shift in direction for America's human spaceflight programme.On 14 January 2004, President George W Bush announced that the space shuttle would be retired after completion of the International Space Station (ISS). In its place, America would build a new vehicle capable of returning astronauts to the Moon.The following year, then-Nasa chief Mike Griffin announced that the completion of the ISS would, for the first time, open up commercial opportunities for the routine transportation of cargo and astronauts to low-Earth orbit. This, Griffin reasoned, was required to free up enough funds to achieve a Moon return. Nasa established a Commercial Crew & Cargo Program Office (C3PO) to oversee the effort.At the time, SpaceX, the company started by South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk was just a few years old. Musk had lofty ambitions about bringing down the cost of spaceflight by re-using space hardware and settling humans on Mars. He also had many doubters.But SpaceX, along with Virginia-based Orbital Sciences, would eventually win contracts to fulfil the first part of Nasa's commercial vision - ferrying supplies and other cargo to the space station. SpaceX's Dragon cargo spacecraft could not carry humans, but it was a major milestone for the company.In 2008, Barack Obama became president. His administration kicked off a review of the human spaceflight programme, which led to the cancellation of his predecessor's plan to return to the Moon (known as Constellation). However, the Obama administration favoured the continued commercialisation of space, backing the development of private crew vehicles. But it would take time and, after the space shuttle was retired, Nasa had to fill the gap by paying Russia tens of millions of dollars per seat to fly its astronauts to the ISS on the Soyuz vehicle, which launches from Baikonur in Kazakhstan.Congress was initially sceptical about the Commercial Crew Program and did not provide sufficient funds at first. But Charles Bolden, the former astronaut who took over from Griffin as Nasa chief under Obama, persisted and eventually secured the support he needed.From their initial $50m investment in the programme in 2010, the space agency whittled several competing companies down to two - SpaceX and Boeing - in 2014.Since then, they have been refining and testing their spacecraft designs. In March 2019, SpaceX performed a triumphant launch of the Crew Dragon without astronauts. Using automated procedures, the capsule successfully approached and docked with the space station. It was carrying a mannequin called Ripley - after Ellen Ripley, the protagonist in the Alien movies - decked out with sensors to measure the G forces experienced during flight, particularly the launch and return phases. Despite this success, and others along the way, it hasn't always been plain sailing for SpaceX. In 2016, a Falcon 9 rocket blew up on the launch pad. And in April 2019, a Crew Dragon capsule exploded during a so-called static fire test on the ground. No one was hurt in either event. The spacecraft was also having problems with the parachute system designed to bring it back safely to Earth. These mishaps, along with earlier funding shortfalls for the Commercial Crew Program, had introduced delays to an original timeline that would have seen SpaceX launch crew to the ISS in October 2016. Frustrated by the hold ups and the time SpaceX was spending on its Starship project to build a super heavy-lift launch vehicle, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted:My statement on @SpaceX's announcement tomorrow: pic.twitter.com/C67MhSeNsaEnd of Twitter post  by @JimBridenstineBridenstine sent the tweet the night before a major Starship media event where Musk was due to speak.The next day, Musk shot back with a quip aimed at the agency's own timelines. Asked about the tweet by CNN, Musk answered: ""Did he (Bridenstine) say Commercial Crew or SLS?""The SpaceX founder was referring to Nasa's Space Launch System rocket - designed to launch humans to the Moon - which has also been hit by delays and cost overruns.Musk's company wasn't alone in experiencing challenges, however. A timing anomaly prevented Boeing's spacecraft - the CST-100 Starliner - from docking with the space station during an uncrewed test flight last year.However, a successful in-flight test of the Crew Dragon's launch abort system in January 2020 helped clear the way for the historic flight from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on 30 May.In the post-launch press conference, both Bridenstine and Musk struck more conciliatory tones, in contrast to the tensions over the Starship project.""If you would have told me then (eight months prior, when he sent the tweet) that we would be right here today, I don't know that I would have believed it,"" said Bridenstine.""Since that day, Elon Musk and SpaceX have delivered on everything Nasa has asked them to deliver on - and at a speed that we never would have guessed.""The Nasa chief also congratulated SpaceX on its safety culture. Musk replied: ""Nasa made us way better than we would otherwise have been - and of course, we couldn't even have got started without Nasa.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",27 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Who are the astronauts?,"Two US astronauts have achieved a world first by launching to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a spacecraft built by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Here, BBC News profiles the crew members.Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have broken a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011. In the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz.But officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program.Musk's vehicle was first to fly; Hurley and Behnken travelled to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft.""It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it,"" Hurley, 53, said at the beginning of May, before the flight.Behnken, 49, added: ""On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him.""Nasa chose two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends.""Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that,"" says Hurley.When they launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses knew exactly what they were going through. That's because they're astronauts too.Marine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel.Nyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas.""Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was,"" Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013.Air Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. As an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six.Hurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport.They ""can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be,"" Behnken told CNN before the launch. ""We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands.""Hurley says of Behnken: ""I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face."" But Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two.The older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. ""It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college,"" Hurley said in 2009.Behnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010, he described it as ""a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood"", adding: ""I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person.""He took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him. Both men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines.They both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven.""When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker',"" said Hurley. ""But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table.""Hurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms.Thus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay.When the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as the prime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard.""Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point,"" Hurley said this month.They've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels.Hurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX.""That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them,"" he explained.Setbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016. ""We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made,"" explained Hurley.Despite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remained undimmed: ""It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship.""Hurley told CNN: ""From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree.""But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",31 May 2020,science
Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate,"The discovery of a new breeding pair raises hope for the survival of the world's rarest primate, the Hainan Gibbon.Ravaged by deforestation and poaching, the ape now lives only in a patch of forest on China's Hainan island.In the 1950s, there were an estimated 2,000 left in the world, but numbers fell to fewer than 10 in the 1970s.The latest census shows numbers have tripled to more than 30 gibbons, living in five separate family groups.The fragile recovery follows decades of work by the Hainan Gibbon Conservation Project, run by the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Hong Kong. ""I can't imagine how sad it would be if Hainan rainforest lost this beautiful animal and its wonderful song,"" said Philip Lo, senior conservation officer.Gibbons are known for their ability to swing gracefully through the forest canopy, making loud, haunting calls to mark their territory. Breeding adults sing duets at dawn to enhance bonding.Villagers heard the calls of two gibbons living in a part of the forest away from the main population late last year.A male and a female were later spotted, and heard singing together, showing they had formed a stable bond. The gibbon forms family groups consisting of one male, two females and their young offspring. The discovery of a fifth breeding pair in a separate fragment of forest is seen as highly significant.Philip Lo said the species remained the rarest primate in the world, but there is hope it could overcome the risk of extinction and recover steadily. He described the success as ""a piece of good news that could cheer up other dedicated conservation colleagues"".Conservation efforts have been under way at Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve since 2003, when the first full census found only 13 individuals living in two groups.A comprehensive rescue programme was put in place, including patrols and monitoring, research into the apes' ecology and behaviour, and the planting of thousands of trees to provide food and shelter.Nearly 20 gibbon species exist throughout the world, from northeastern India to Borneo. Most are under threat from the destruction of forests, hunting and illegal trade.Two species of gibbon have recently disappeared in China and all surviving Chinese species, including the Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), are classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.Follow Helen on Twitter.",1 June 2020,science
Covid recovery could 'tip the balance' for nature,"Environmental scientists have called for the conservation of nature to be at the centre of the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.With countries still ensnared by the crisis, scientists have urged governments to make plans that ""safeguard biodiversity and human health"" as they rebuild. The researchers published an open letter in the journal Science.""How we emerge from lockdowns,"" they say, ""will drive a new world economy."" This is likely to have lasting effects on global biodiversity, the Australian authors argue.The right long-term plans, from governments and international organisations, could ""tip the balance"" in favour of nature. There are some striking examples of upheavals that have had unintended benefits for nature. The catastrophic nuclear accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine, and the resulting exclusion zone around the plant, created an unplanned wilderness that has since been designated an ecological reserve. ""The Colombia Conflict, for example, created unofficial protected areas,"" explained Dr Ryan Pearson from Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. ""This slowed environmental degradation because people were fearful of entering remote areas occupied by rebels.""The more recent ""post-conflict"" increase in deforestation there shows the need for longer-term strategies that can maintain the positive side effects of crises.""There have been many reports of wild animals increasing in numbers and turning up in places they haven't been seen i a long time,"" Dr Pearson told BBC News. "" This carries implications that certain species may be benefiting from the absence of human influence during lockdowns or possibly because of reduced pollution, especially in waterways.""We can't be sure how long such effects will last unless long-term strategies are implemented to encourage them.""There is, the scientists say, a concern that the rush to re-stabilise and grow economies may come ""at the expense of the environment"".This group of environmental scientists are adding their voices to a call for a greener focus as the world rebuilds. Dr Pearson added: ""We hope our letter will encourage positive strategies to support biodiversity into legislation, and the behaviour of people in their choices - in their consumption, investment, and travel.""Follow Victoria on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
