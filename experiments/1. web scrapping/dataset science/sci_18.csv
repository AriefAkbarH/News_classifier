SpaceX Nasa Mission: Astronauts on historic mission enter space station,"US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have docked with, and entered, the International Space Station (ISS).Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - attached to the bow section of the orbiting lab 422km above China.After a wait for leak, pressure and temperature checks, the pair disembarked to join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS.Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday.Theirs is the first crew outing launched from American soil since the retirement of the US space agency (Nasa) shuttles nine years ago. The mission marks the beginning of a new era in which Nasa will be purchasing transport services from the commercial sector. No more will it own and operate the American vehicles that run to and from the station.This will be done exclusively by firms such as SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk.Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST) on Sunday, 19 hours after leaving the Kennedy Space Center atop a Falcon rocket also provided by SpaceX.The docking was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach. The doors between Dragon and the ISS were opened at 17:02 GMT (18:02 BST). When Hurley and Behnken floated through, they were met by ISS Commander and fellow Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.""We're just happy to be here and Chris is going to put us work. And hopefully we will fit in and not mess too many things up,"" said Doug Hurley as he nursed a bruise picked up on his forehead. Bob Behnken said the pair were well rested and ready for the tasks ahead.""We did get probably a good seven hours or so (of sleep),"" he said in a radio link with mission control in Houston, Texas. ""The first night is always a little bit of a challenge, but the Dragon was a slick vehicle, and we had good air flow and so we had an excellent evening. (We're) just excited to be back in low-Earth orbit again.""Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine congratulated the duo on a job well done: ""The whole world saw this mission and we are so, so proud of everything you've done for our country and, in fact, to inspire the world.""SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans.Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers.SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract, which will encompass six astronaut ""taxi"" flights, with the first of these likely to occur at the end of August. Hurley's and Behnken's arrival at the ISS means they get to claim a Stars and Stripes flag placed on the platform by the members of the very last space shuttle mission in 2011.The Atlantis orbiter's crew left this flag as an incentive to all those that came after them. The flag, which also flew on the very first shuttle flight in 1981, will now be returned to Earth to be given to the mission that next goes beyond Earth orbit.  Earlier, Hurley and Behnken named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it ""Endeavour"", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s.It's somewhat uncertain how long Hurley and Behnken will stay at the ISS, but perhaps as much as four months.In that time, they will become members of the current ISS Expedition 63 crew, taking part in the platform's everyday science and maintenance activities.Chris Cassidy joked that because his new crewmates arrived on a Sunday, they had missed the cleaning chores that normally take place on a Saturday.

Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate,"The discovery of a new breeding pair raises hope for the survival of the world's rarest primate, the Hainan Gibbon.Ravaged by deforestation and poaching, the ape now lives only in a patch of forest on China's Hainan island.In the 1950s, there were an estimated 2,000 left in the world, but numbers fell to fewer than 10 in the 1970s.The latest census shows numbers have tripled to more than 30 gibbons, living in five separate family groups.The fragile recovery follows decades of work by the Hainan Gibbon Conservation Project, run by the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Hong Kong. ""I can't imagine how sad it would be if Hainan rainforest lost this beautiful animal and its wonderful song,"" said Philip Lo, senior conservation officer.Gibbons are known for their ability to swing gracefully through the forest canopy, making loud, haunting calls to mark their territory. Breeding adults sing duets at dawn to enhance bonding.Villagers heard the calls of two gibbons living in a part of the forest away from the main population late last year.A male and a female were later spotted, and heard singing together, showing they had formed a stable bond. The gibbon forms family groups consisting of one male, two females and their young offspring. The discovery of a fifth breeding pair in a separate fragment of forest is seen as highly significant.Philip Lo said the species remained the rarest primate in the world, but there is hope it could overcome the risk of extinction and recover steadily. He described the success as ""a piece of good news that could cheer up other dedicated conservation colleagues"".Conservation efforts have been under way at Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve since 2003, when the first full census found only 13 individuals living in two groups.A comprehensive rescue programme was put in place, including patrols and monitoring, research into the apes' ecology and behaviour, and the planting of thousands of trees to provide food and shelter.Nearly 20 gibbon species exist throughout the world, from northeastern India to Borneo. Most are under threat from the destruction of forests, hunting and illegal trade.Two species of gibbon have recently disappeared in China and all surviving Chinese species, including the Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), are classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.Follow Helen on Twitter.",1 June 2020,science
Climate change: How a green new deal really could go global,"Good news is in short supply at the moment, so brace yourself for a rare burst of optimism about climate change. World leaders know their countries face one of the most severe recessions in history thanks to the coronavirus restrictions.That presents a unique challenge, but also a massive opportunity.Politicians know they are going to need to spend huge amounts of money to kick-start economic activity as the threat of coronavirus finally recedes.It is a one-off, never-to-be-repeated chance to transform their economies. So the question is, what will they spend it on?This week the European Union put its cards on the table. On Wednesday it unveiled what it is billing as the biggest ""green"" stimulus package in history. ""This is about all of us and it is way bigger than any one of us,"" announced Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, when she told European Parliament members what was planned.  ""This is Europe's moment,"" she said.As well as being a big step towards federalism, the recovery package puts fighting climate change at the heart of the bloc's recovery from the pandemic. The scale of what is being proposed is mind-boggling. The headline figure is €750bn, but add in spending from future budgets and the total financial firepower the European Commission says it will be wielding is almost €2tn ($2.2tn).There will be tens of billions of euros to make homes more energy efficient, to decarbonise electricity and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles. The idea is to turbo-charge the European effort to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.""If we do not do it we will be taking much more risk,"" Teresa Ribera, the deputy Prime Minister of Spain told me.""The recovery should be green or it will not be a recovery, it will just be a short-cut into the kind of problems we are facing right now.""If you are thinking this is just something that sandal-wearing European liberals might get behind, think again.Donald Trump may be an avowed supporter of fossil fuels, but his Democratic opponent in the November presidential election is not.Joe Biden is reckoned to be planning a similarly huge green stimulus package for the US.The model is the vast investment projects of the New Deal that helped lift America out of the Great Depression in the 1930s.That was the defining policy of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.Biden is reportedly preparing for his own ""FDR-size presidency"", according to New York magazine.""He knows he needs youth enthusiasm, he knows he needs the left, he knows he needs the core democratic base, and he knows climate is probably the best issue to get that,"" explains energy and climate analyst David Roberts of the US website Vox.""Climate polls the best across all those groups, climate even polls pretty well among wavering Trump voters,"" he says.This is not just about rallying voters. There are sound economic reasons why politicians see green technology as a prudent investment.First off, renewables are now often cheaper than fossil fuels in large parts of the world.The technologies are proven and can be built at scale today.And most importantly, their cost follows the logic of all manufacturing - the more you produce, the cheaper it gets.The same logic applies to hydrogen and to electric vehicles. But it does not apply to fossil fuels, whose cost ultimately relies on mining ever more difficult and dwindling resources.And that contains the seductive promise that a huge government push to scale up solar and wind will make them even more affordable compared with coal, oil and gas - not just in the US, but globally.So the argument goes that renewables provide a pathway for clean growth in the future.Develop innovative new electric vehicles, wind turbines, ways of making homes energy-efficient, energy storage technologies or even new ways of configuring electricity grids and you are likely to find ready markets around the world in coming years.Equally importantly, renewable technologies offer something else that will be needed in the years to come: the potential to create huge numbers of new jobs.The Covid-19 crisis has driven joblessness to near Great Depression levels around the world - worse even than in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Around 40 million Americans are unemployed.Worldwide, 1.6 billion people are reckoned to be in immediate danger of losing their livelihoods, according to the International Labour Organisation.That means governments need to find ways to employ lots and lots of people.Renewable technologies offer precisely the kind of ""shovel-ready"", large-scale and labour-intensive infrastructure projects politicians are looking for.There is the obvious stuff - building wind turbines, solar farms and the foundations of a hydrogen economy - but think also about installing networks of charging points for electric vehicles, the need to insulate homes or revamp urban transport systems.Just like the road and dam building of the American New Deal, projects like these could employ tens of thousands of people in high-skilled and - crucially - local jobs.But here's the rub. China currently looks set to take a very different route to recovery.It remains the biggest piece of the climate change puzzle. China produces almost a third of the world's emissions, as much as the US and the EU combined.Last week, the country's top legislative body, the annual National People's Congress, was in full session.The country already has a big expansion of coal-fired electricity generation underway. There was no suggestion this would be reversed.After the financial crisis in 2008, China ramped up coal-fired power stations as a key part of its stimulus package. But there is still a lot to play for this time round, says Li Shuo, an energy expert with Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing.Few details of the Covid recovery plan were announced at the NPC, and he says much will depend on what American voters decide in November.""The US position looms very large in China's political calculus,"" explains Mr Li.He believes President Trump's energy policies are one of the major barriers to China raising its climate ambitions.""I think there is a feeling here in China that it is unfair for Beijing to move forward with its climate agenda at the same time as the US is moving backwards.""That said, the Chinese public certainly seems to support measures to decarbonise the economy.Eighty-seven percent of Chinese people see climate change as serious a threat as Covid-19, according to a poll conducted in 14 countries by Ipsos MORI in April. Even in America, where support was lowest, 59% of people agreed that the risks of climate change matched those of the coronavirus in the long term.Nearly two-thirds of all respondents and 57% of Americans said it was important that government actions aimed at economic recovery prioritised action on climate change.And once big economies like Europe and the US adopt policies like these, there is good reason to think other countries will follow suit.One of the most striking - and controversial - aspects of the European plan is that it will be funded in large part by debt raised by the European Commission itself.That represents a significant deepening or European integration that some member states have already signalled they will resist. Under the proposal the hundreds of billions of euros of debt would be serviced by new EU-wide taxes.One option being discussed is a carbon tax that would include levies on imported goods with a high carbon footprint.Think about what that means.Countries that want to sell into the largest economy in the world would now face penalties unless they make efforts to clean up their energy systems.Now imagine that America embarks on a Green New Deal. It might choose to introduce a similar tariff.But I opened this piece offering optimism, so let me present an alternative path. The countries that decarbonise first could lead by example. Remember, the more renewables you produce, the cheaper they get.As low carbon technologies increasingly undercut the fossil fuel alternatives, you won't need a stick to beat other countries into changing their ways - they will just follow the money.You see where this is headed.? Maybe we are not as far away from widespread coordinated action on climate change as many people fear.As I said at the start, a rare opportunity for optimism amongst the gloom of this present crisis.You can hear a radio programme Justin made with producer Laurence Knight about how plans for gigantic government investments to decarbonise the world economy are gaining traction on the World Service's Business Daily.

Climate change: 'Stunning' seafloor ridges record Antarctic retreat,"Scientists are learning just how fast the ice margin of Antarctica can retreat in a warming world.They've identified features on the seafloor that indicate the ice edge was reversing at rates of up to 50m a day at the end of the last ice age.That's roughly 10 times faster than what's observed by satellites today.The discovery is important because it puts realistic constraints on the computer simulations that are used to project future change in the region.""In numerical models, you play with the parameters - and they can do very strange things,"" said Prof Julian Dowdeswell. ""But what these data are saying is that actually rates considerably higher than we get even in the satellite record today were possible in the not-far-distant geological past.""The director of the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in Cambridge, UK, led an expedition last year to the Larsen region of the Antarctic Peninsula.His team deployed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with high-resolution mapping capability to examine the sediments at the bottom of the western Weddell Sea.What the robots saw was a delicate pattern of ridges that looked like a series of ladders where each rung was about 1.5m high and spaced roughly 20-25m apart.The scientists interpret these ridges to be features that are generated at the ice grounding zone. This zone is the point where the ice flowing off Antarctica into the ocean becomes buoyant and starts to float. The rungs are created as the ice at this location repeatedly pats the sediments as the tides rise and fall.For the pattern to have been produced and preserved, the ice must have been in retreat (advancing ice would destroy the ridges). And the tidal ""clock"" therefore gives a rate for this reversal.Prof Dowdeswell explained: ""We have a maximum of 90 of these rungs with a spacing of 20-25m - that gives us, if extrapolated, a rate of 40-50m per day. Again, if extrapolated - that's a rate in excess of 10km per year of retreat. And the really interesting thing about that is it's a rate that's pretty much an order of magnitude higher than even the most rapid retreat of the grounding lines in the Pine Island-Thwaites system today.""Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are two of Antarctica's fastest-changing ice bodies whose ice margins are being melted by warm ocean water getting underneath them.The ridges seen by the AUVs are some 40km from the cliffs that front the ice edge in the Larsen sector today. The marks are considered to be around 12,000 years old. Back then, the ice sheet would have been far more extensive than it is today, but like today would have been experiencing rapid change as the global climate emerged from the deepest of freezes.Dr Alistair Graham from the University of South Florida, US, works with AUV data. He was not involved in this research.He said he found the interpretation compelling but that there would likely be some scepticism in the community that the rungs really did form daily with the tides.""The data in the paper are absolutely stunning,"" he told BBC News.  ""The ability to map at a sub-metre resolution from an AUV really lifts a veil on the seafloor structure and composition. We have been able to get snapshots of these sorts of images before, by sending an AUV under Pine Island Glacier, for example, but these imagery from the Dowdeswell team are the best yet from anywhere around Antarctica. ""What this paper also emphasises to me is that there are still big lessons to learn from looking at the past history of ice sheets at the poles. For somewhere like Thwaites Glacier, where we are desperate to understand its future trajectory, understanding what it did in the centuries and millennia leading up to the observations we are making today will be a critical part of determining how much ice is lost and how fast going forwards. ""We do have similar high-resolution imagery from an AUV deployed at Thwaites Glacier last year that we are currently working on, and which will hopefully tackle some of these pressing questions."" The new research is published in the journal Science. The Weddell Sea Expedition 2019 was an international effort led from the SPRI and funded in part by the Flotilla Foundation and Marine Archaeology Consultants Switzerland.The AUVs were operated by the US-UK Ocean Infinity company.

And the really interesting thing about that is it's a rate that's pretty much an order of magnitude higher than even the most rapid retreat of the grounding lines in the Pine Island-Thwaites system today.""Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are two of Antarctica's fastest-changing ice bodies whose ice margins are being melted by warm ocean water getting underneath them.The ridges seen by the AUVs are some 40km from the cliffs that front the ice edge in the Larsen sector today. The marks are considered to be around 12,000 years old. Back then, the ice sheet would have been far more extensive than it is today, but like today would have been experiencing rapid change as the global climate emerged from the deepest of freezes.Dr Alistair Graham from the University of South Florida, US, works with AUV data. He was not involved in this research.He said he found the interpretation compelling but that there would likely be some scepticism in the community that the rungs really did form daily with the tides.""The data in the paper are absolutely stunning,"" he told BBC News.  ""The ability to map at a sub-metre resolution from an AUV really lifts a veil on the seafloor structure and composition. We have been able to get snapshots of these sorts of images before, by sending an AUV under Pine Island Glacier, for example, but these imagery from the Dowdeswell team are the best yet from anywhere around Antarctica. ""What this paper also emphasises to me is that there are still big lessons to learn from looking at the past history of ice sheets at the poles. For somewhere like Thwaites Glacier, where we are desperate to understand its future trajectory, understanding what it did in the centuries and millennia leading up to the observations we are making today will be a critical part of determining how much ice is lost and how fast going forwards. ""We do have similar high-resolution imagery from an AUV deployed at Thwaites Glacier last year that we are currently working on, and which will hopefully tackle some of these pressing questions.""

SpaceX Nasa Mission: Astronauts on historic mission enter space station,"US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have docked with, and entered, the International Space Station (ISS).Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - attached to the bow section of the orbiting lab 422km above China.After a wait for leak, pressure and temperature checks, the pair disembarked to join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS.Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday.Theirs is the first crew outing launched from American soil since the retirement of the US space agency (Nasa) shuttles nine years ago. The mission marks the beginning of a new era in which Nasa will be purchasing transport services from the commercial sector. No more will it own and operate the American vehicles that run to and from the station.This will be done exclusively by firms such as SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk.Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST) on Sunday, 19 hours after leaving the Kennedy Space Center atop a Falcon rocket also provided by SpaceX.The docking was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach. The doors between Dragon and the ISS were opened at 17:02 GMT (18:02 BST). When Hurley and Behnken floated through, they were met by ISS Commander and fellow Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.""We're just happy to be here and Chris is going to put us work. And hopefully we will fit in and not mess too many things up,"" said Doug Hurley as he nursed a bruise picked up on his forehead. Bob Behnken said the pair were well rested and ready for the tasks ahead.""We did get probably a good seven hours or so (of sleep),"" he said in a radio link with mission control in Houston, Texas. ""The first night is always a little bit of a challenge, but the Dragon was a slick vehicle, and we had good air flow and so we had an excellent evening. (We're) just excited to be back in low-Earth orbit again.""Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine congratulated the duo on a job well done: ""The whole world saw this mission and we are so, so proud of everything you've done for our country and, in fact, to inspire the world.""SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans.Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers.SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract, which will encompass six astronaut ""taxi"" flights, with the first of these likely to occur at the end of August. Hurley's and Behnken's arrival at the ISS means they get to claim a Stars and Stripes flag placed on the platform by the members of the very last space shuttle mission in 2011.The Atlantis orbiter's crew left this flag as an incentive to all those that came after them. The flag, which also flew on the very first shuttle flight in 1981, will now be returned to Earth to be given to the mission that next goes beyond Earth orbit.  Earlier, Hurley and Behnken named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it ""Endeavour"", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s.It's somewhat uncertain how long Hurley and Behnken will stay at the ISS, but perhaps as much as four months.In that time, they will become members of the current ISS Expedition 63 crew, taking part in the platform's everyday science and maintenance activities.Chris Cassidy joked that because his new crewmates arrived on a Sunday, they had missed the cleaning chores that normally take place on a Saturday. ""We'll catch up next weekend,"" the commander said.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",31 May 2020,science
Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate,"The discovery of a new breeding pair raises hope for the survival of the world's rarest primate, the Hainan Gibbon.Ravaged by deforestation and poaching, the ape now lives only in a patch of forest on China's Hainan island.In the 1950s, there were an estimated 2,000 left in the world, but numbers fell to fewer than 10 in the 1970s.The latest census shows numbers have tripled to more than 30 gibbons, living in five separate family groups.The fragile recovery follows decades of work by the Hainan Gibbon Conservation Project, run by the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Hong Kong. ""I can't imagine how sad it would be if Hainan rainforest lost this beautiful animal and its wonderful song,"" said Philip Lo, senior conservation officer.Gibbons are known for their ability to swing gracefully through the forest canopy, making loud, haunting calls to mark their territory. Breeding adults sing duets at dawn to enhance bonding.Villagers heard the calls of two gibbons living in a part of the forest away from the main population late last year.A male and a female were later spotted, and heard singing together, showing they had formed a stable bond. The gibbon forms family groups consisting of one male, two females and their young offspring. The discovery of a fifth breeding pair in a separate fragment of forest is seen as highly significant.Philip Lo said the species remained the rarest primate in the world, but there is hope it could overcome the risk of extinction and recover steadily. He described the success as ""a piece of good news that could cheer up other dedicated conservation colleagues"".Conservation efforts have been under way at Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve since 2003, when the first full census found only 13 individuals living in two groups.A comprehensive rescue programme was put in place, including patrols and monitoring, research into the apes' ecology and behaviour, and the planting of thousands of trees to provide food and shelter.Nearly 20 gibbon species exist throughout the world, from northeastern India to Borneo. Most are under threat from the destruction of forests, hunting and illegal trade.Two species of gibbon have recently disappeared in China and all surviving Chinese species, including the Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), are classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.Follow Helen on Twitter.",1 June 2020,science
Climate change: How a green new deal really could go global,"Good news is in short supply at the moment, so brace yourself for a rare burst of optimism about climate change. World leaders know their countries face one of the most severe recessions in history thanks to the coronavirus restrictions.That presents a unique challenge, but also a massive opportunity.Politicians know they are going to need to spend huge amounts of money to kick-start economic activity as the threat of coronavirus finally recedes.It is a one-off, never-to-be-repeated chance to transform their economies. So the question is, what will they spend it on?This week the European Union put its cards on the table. On Wednesday it unveiled what it is billing as the biggest ""green"" stimulus package in history. ""This is about all of us and it is way bigger than any one of us,"" announced Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, when she told European Parliament members what was planned.  ""This is Europe's moment,"" she said.As well as being a big step towards federalism, the recovery package puts fighting climate change at the heart of the bloc's recovery from the pandemic. The scale of what is being proposed is mind-boggling. The headline figure is €750bn, but add in spending from future budgets and the total financial firepower the European Commission says it will be wielding is almost €2tn ($2.2tn).There will be tens of billions of euros to make homes more energy efficient, to decarbonise electricity and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles. The idea is to turbo-charge the European effort to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.""If we do not do it we will be taking much more risk,"" Teresa Ribera, the deputy Prime Minister of Spain told me.""The recovery should be green or it will not be a recovery, it will just be a short-cut into the kind of problems we are facing right now.""If you are thinking this is just something that sandal-wearing European liberals might get behind, think again.Donald Trump may be an avowed supporter of fossil fuels, but his Democratic opponent in the November presidential election is not.Joe Biden is reckoned to be planning a similarly huge green stimulus package for the US.The model is the vast investment projects of the New Deal that helped lift America out of the Great Depression in the 1930s.That was the defining policy of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.Biden is reportedly preparing for his own ""FDR-size presidency"", according to New York magazine.""He knows he needs youth enthusiasm, he knows he needs the left, he knows he needs the core democratic base, and he knows climate is probably the best issue to get that,"" explains energy and climate analyst David Roberts of the US website Vox.""Climate polls the best across all those groups, climate even polls pretty well among wavering Trump voters,"" he says.This is not just about rallying voters. There are sound economic reasons why politicians see green technology as a prudent investment.First off, renewables are now often cheaper than fossil fuels in large parts of the world.The technologies are proven and can be built at scale today.And most importantly, their cost follows the logic of all manufacturing - the more you produce, the cheaper it gets.The same logic applies to hydrogen and to electric vehicles. But it does not apply to fossil fuels, whose cost ultimately relies on mining ever more difficult and dwindling resources.And that contains the seductive promise that a huge government push to scale up solar and wind will make them even more affordable compared with coal, oil and gas - not just in the US, but globally.So the argument goes that renewables provide a pathway for clean growth in the future.Develop innovative new electric vehicles, wind turbines, ways of making homes energy-efficient, energy storage technologies or even new ways of configuring electricity grids and you are likely to find ready markets around the world in coming years.Equally importantly, renewable technologies offer something else that will be needed in the years to come: the potential to create huge numbers of new jobs.The Covid-19 crisis has driven joblessness to near Great Depression levels around the world - worse even than in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Around 40 million Americans are unemployed.Worldwide, 1.6 billion people are reckoned to be in immediate danger of losing their livelihoods, according to the International Labour Organisation.That means governments need to find ways to employ lots and lots of people.Renewable technologies offer precisely the kind of ""shovel-ready"", large-scale and labour-intensive infrastructure projects politicians are looking for.There is the obvious stuff - building wind turbines, solar farms and the foundations of a hydrogen economy - but think also about installing networks of charging points for electric vehicles, the need to insulate homes or revamp urban transport systems.Just like the road and dam building of the American New Deal, projects like these could employ tens of thousands of people in high-skilled and - crucially - local jobs.But here's the rub. China currently looks set to take a very different route to recovery.It remains the biggest piece of the climate change puzzle. China produces almost a third of the world's emissions, as much as the US and the EU combined.Last week, the country's top legislative body, the annual National People's Congress, was in full session.The country already has a big expansion of coal-fired electricity generation underway. There was no suggestion this would be reversed.After the financial crisis in 2008, China ramped up coal-fired power stations as a key part of its stimulus package. But there is still a lot to play for this time round, says Li Shuo, an energy expert with Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing.Few details of the Covid recovery plan were announced at the NPC, and he says much will depend on what American voters decide in November.""The US position looms very large in China's political calculus,"" explains Mr Li.He believes President Trump's energy policies are one of the major barriers to China raising its climate ambitions.""I think there is a feeling here in China that it is unfair for Beijing to move forward with its climate agenda at the same time as the US is moving backwards.""That said, the Chinese public certainly seems to support measures to decarbonise the economy.Eighty-seven percent of Chinese people see climate change as serious a threat as Covid-19, according to a poll conducted in 14 countries by Ipsos MORI in April. Even in America, where support was lowest, 59% of people agreed that the risks of climate change matched those of the coronavirus in the long term.Nearly two-thirds of all respondents and 57% of Americans said it was important that government actions aimed at economic recovery prioritised action on climate change.And once big economies like Europe and the US adopt policies like these, there is good reason to think other countries will follow suit.One of the most striking - and controversial - aspects of the European plan is that it will be funded in large part by debt raised by the European Commission itself.That represents a significant deepening or European integration that some member states have already signalled they will resist. Under the proposal the hundreds of billions of euros of debt would be serviced by new EU-wide taxes.One option being discussed is a carbon tax that would include levies on imported goods with a high carbon footprint.Think about what that means.Countries that want to sell into the largest economy in the world would now face penalties unless they make efforts to clean up their energy systems.Now imagine that America embarks on a Green New Deal. It might choose to introduce a similar tariff.But I opened this piece offering optimism, so let me present an alternative path. The countries that decarbonise first could lead by example. Remember, the more renewables you produce, the cheaper they get.As low carbon technologies increasingly undercut the fossil fuel alternatives, you won't need a stick to beat other countries into changing their ways - they will just follow the money.You see where this is headed.? Maybe we are not as far away from widespread coordinated action on climate change as many people fear.As I said at the start, a rare opportunity for optimism amongst the gloom of this present crisis.You can hear a radio programme Justin made with producer Laurence Knight about how plans for gigantic government investments to decarbonise the world economy are gaining traction on the World Service's Business Daily.

Climate change: 'Stunning' seafloor ridges record Antarctic retreat,"Scientists are learning just how fast the ice margin of Antarctica can retreat in a warming world.They've identified features on the seafloor that indicate the ice edge was reversing at rates of up to 50m a day at the end of the last ice age.That's roughly 10 times faster than what's observed by satellites today.The discovery is important because it puts realistic constraints on the computer simulations that are used to project future change in the region.""In numerical models, you play with the parameters - and they can do very strange things,"" said Prof Julian Dowdeswell. ""But what these data are saying is that actually rates considerably higher than we get even in the satellite record today were possible in the not-far-distant geological past.""The director of the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in Cambridge, UK, led an expedition last year to the Larsen region of the Antarctic Peninsula.His team deployed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with high-resolution mapping capability to examine the sediments at the bottom of the western Weddell Sea.What the robots saw was a delicate pattern of ridges that looked like a series of ladders where each rung was about 1.5m high and spaced roughly 20-25m apart.The scientists interpret these ridges to be features that are generated at the ice grounding zone. This zone is the point where the ice flowing off Antarctica into the ocean becomes buoyant and starts to float. The rungs are created as the ice at this location repeatedly pats the sediments as the tides rise and fall.For the pattern to have been produced and preserved, the ice must have been in retreat (advancing ice would destroy the ridges). And the tidal ""clock"" therefore gives a rate for this reversal.Prof Dowdeswell explained: ""We have a maximum of 90 of these rungs with a spacing of 20-25m - that gives us, if extrapolated, a rate of 40-50m per day. Again, if extrapolated - that's a rate in excess of 10km per year of retreat. And the really interesting thing about that is it's a rate that's pretty much an order of magnitude higher than even the most rapid retreat of the grounding lines in the Pine Island-Thwaites system today.""Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are two of Antarctica's fastest-changing ice bodies whose ice margins are being melted by warm ocean water getting underneath them.The ridges seen by the AUVs are some 40km from the cliffs that front the ice edge in the Larsen sector today. The marks are considered to be around 12,000 years old. Back then, the ice sheet would have been far more extensive than it is today, but like today would have been experiencing rapid change as the global climate emerged from the deepest of freezes.Dr Alistair Graham from the University of South Florida, US, works with AUV data. He was not involved in this research.He said he found the interpretation compelling but that there would likely be some scepticism in the community that the rungs really did form daily with the tides.""The data in the paper are absolutely stunning,"" he told BBC News.  ""The ability to map at a sub-metre resolution from an AUV really lifts a veil on the seafloor structure and composition.

SpaceX launch: Nasa astronauts begin historic mission on private spaceship,"The private rocket company SpaceX has sent two Nasa astronauts into orbit.It's the first time since the retirement of the shuttles nine years ago that an American crew has made the journey from US territory.Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are not only trialling a new capsule system, they are also initiating a new business model for Nasa.The agency will no longer own the vehicles it uses but merely purchase the ""taxi"" service offered by SpaceX.It's hoped companies other than tech billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX outfit will come in to expand the market. The aerospace giant Boeing already has a contract with Nasa to do so. Mr Musk himself said he was overcome with emotion watching his hardware take the astronauts to orbit. ""I think this is something that should get people right in the heart, of anyone that has the spirit of exploration. And the US is the distillation of the spirit of exploration,"" he told reporters.The new capability the CEO is offering will end the reliance of Nasa on Russian rockets and capsules to get its people to the International Space Station (ISS).It was a point picked up on by President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch the launch.""Past leaders put the US at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore,"" he said. ""Today we once again proudly launched American astronauts on American rockets - the best in the world - from right here on American soil.""Hurley's and Behnken's Dragon ship left Earth atop its Falcon-9 rocket precisely on time - at 15:22 EDT (19:22 GMT / 20:22 BST).Meteorologists had forecast only a 50:50 chance of favourable conditions around Florida's Kennedy Space Center at lift-off, but, as luck would have it, the weather window stayed open and the SpaceX controllers grabbed their opportunity.The Falcon soared off the spaceport's famous 39A pad to head northeast out over the Atlantic. After two-and-a-half minutes, the lower-stage of the vehicle had separated to return to a drone ship at sea. And after a further six minutes, the crew were safely inserted into orbit. Hurley and Behnken are set to arrive at the ISS on Sunday.They'll use some of the intervening hours to test equipment and procedures in their capsule, including doing some manual flying. Although the Dragon capsule is a fully automated vehicle capable of finding its own way to the ISS, the crew needs to prepare for all eventualities and that means knowing exactly how the ship will behave in their hands.Uniquely, the Dragon has no control stick; all flight commands must be entered via a touchscreen panel.One of their first tasks in orbit was simply to name their ship - in the tradition of past US spacefarers, all the way back to the Mercury programme. Radioing down to Earth, they announced it would be called Endeavour. Doug Hurley said: ""We chose Endeavour for a few reasons: One, because of this incredible endeavour that Nasa, SpaceX and the US have been on since the end of the shuttle programme back in 2011. The other reason is a little more personal to Bob and I. We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour and it just meant so much to us to carry on that name.""Endeavour was the ship commanded by British explorer James Cook on his voyage to Australia in the late 18th Century.The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay at the ISS is uncertain, but is likely to be somewhere between one and four months. Assuming their return to a splashdown in the Atlantic is as smooth as the launch, Nasa and SpaceX will move directly into the full terms of their new relationship.The company has a $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract with the agency to fly six operational crew missions to the ISS. The first of these should occur at the end August, or very soon after; and will see four astronauts climb aboard a Dragon rather than just the two we saw on this occasion.Saturday's launch went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the spaceport.As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with in the weeks running up to launch, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks.For SpaceX, Saturday marked another significant milestone for the company which was founded just 18 years ago.The firm has upended the launcher industry with its reusable vehicles and is now pioneering a new market-driven approach to human spaceflight.It hasn't all been plain sailing - as evidenced by a spectacular explosion at the  firm's prototyping facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on Friday. But the company has routinely proved naysayers wrong, and Nasa believes its relationship with Elon Musk will save billion of dollars that can be diverted to the more complex task of getting people back to the Moon and then to Mars.    ""We want to establish a commercial environment in low-Earth orbit so that we can focus on the hard job of exploring beyond our home planet, to establish a sustained presence on the Moon and get to Mars to establish a presence there,"" said Bob Cabana, the director at Kennedy.  ""We can't do that if we're locked here in low-Earth orbit, and commercial crew - that's the beginning of a whole new era of spaceflight.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",30 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: How we got to this point,"Elon Musk's SpaceX has launched people to the space station. But why is a private company sending astronauts into space for Nasa?To understand the background to this historic launch with the Crew Dragon spacecraft, we need to go back almost 20 years to a tragic accident.On 1 February 2003, the space shuttle Columbia broke apart while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. All seven astronauts aboard perished in the disaster.The loss of Columbia and its crew was the trigger for a dramatic shift in direction for America's human spaceflight programme.On 14 January 2004, President George W Bush announced that the space shuttle would be retired after completion of the International Space Station (ISS). In its place, America would build a new vehicle capable of returning astronauts to the Moon.The following year, then-Nasa chief Mike Griffin announced that the completion of the ISS would, for the first time, open up commercial opportunities for the routine transportation of cargo and astronauts to low-Earth orbit. This, Griffin reasoned, was required to free up enough funds to achieve a Moon return. Nasa established a Commercial Crew & Cargo Program Office (C3PO) to oversee the effort.At the time, SpaceX, the company started by South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk was just a few years old. Musk had lofty ambitions about bringing down the cost of spaceflight by re-using space hardware and settling humans on Mars. He also had many doubters.But SpaceX, along with Virginia-based Orbital Sciences, would eventually win contracts to fulfil the first part of Nasa's commercial vision - ferrying supplies and other cargo to the space station. SpaceX's Dragon cargo spacecraft could not carry humans, but it was a major milestone for the company.In 2008, Barack Obama became president. His administration kicked off a review of the human spaceflight programme, which led to the cancellation of his predecessor's plan to return to the Moon (known as Constellation). However, the Obama administration favoured the continued commercialisation of space, backing the development of private crew vehicles. But it would take time and, after the space shuttle was retired, Nasa had to fill the gap by paying Russia tens of millions of dollars per seat to fly its astronauts to the ISS on the Soyuz vehicle, which launches from Baikonur in Kazakhstan.Congress was initially sceptical about the Commercial Crew Program and did not provide sufficient funds at first. But Charles Bolden, the former astronaut who took over from Griffin as Nasa chief under Obama, persisted and eventually secured the support he needed.From their initial $50m investment in the programme in 2010, the space agency whittled several competing companies down to two - SpaceX and Boeing - in 2014.Since then, they have been refining and testing their spacecraft designs. In March 2019, SpaceX performed a triumphant launch of the Crew Dragon without astronauts. Using automated procedures, the capsule successfully approached and docked with the space station. It was carrying a mannequin called Ripley - after Ellen Ripley, the protagonist in the Alien movies - decked out with sensors to measure the G forces experienced during flight, particularly the launch and return phases. Despite this success, and others along the way, it hasn't always been plain sailing for SpaceX. In 2016, a Falcon 9 rocket blew up on the launch pad. And in April 2019, a Crew Dragon capsule exploded during a so-called static fire test on the ground. No one was hurt in either event. The spacecraft was also having problems with the parachute system designed to bring it back safely to Earth. These mishaps, along with earlier funding shortfalls for the Commercial Crew Program, had introduced delays to an original timeline that would have seen SpaceX launch crew to the ISS in October 2016. Frustrated by the hold ups and the time SpaceX was spending on its Starship project to build a super heavy-lift launch vehicle, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted:Bridenstine sent the tweet the night before a major Starship media event where Musk was due to speak.The next day, Musk shot back with a quip aimed at the agency's own timelines. Asked about the tweet by CNN, Musk answered: ""Did he (Bridenstine) say Commercial Crew or SLS?""The SpaceX founder was referring to Nasa's Space Launch System rocket - designed to launch humans to the Moon - which has also been hit by delays and cost overruns.Musk's company wasn't alone in experiencing challenges, however. A timing anomaly prevented Boeing's spacecraft - the CST-100 Starliner - from docking with the space station during an uncrewed test flight last year.However, a successful in-flight test of the Crew Dragon's launch abort system in January 2020 helped clear the way for the historic flight from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on 30 May.In the post-launch press conference, both Bridenstine and Musk struck more conciliatory tones, in contrast to the tensions over the Starship project.""If you would have told me then (eight months prior, when he sent the tweet) that we would be right here today, I don't know that I would have believed it,"" said Bridenstine.""Since that day, Elon Musk and SpaceX have delivered on everything Nasa has asked them to deliver on - and at a speed that we never would have guessed.""The Nasa chief also congratulated SpaceX on its safety culture. Musk replied: ""Nasa made us way better than we would otherwise have been - and of course, we couldn't even have got started without Nasa.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",27 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Who are the astronauts?,"Two US astronauts have achieved a world first by launching to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a spacecraft built by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Here, BBC News profiles the crew members.Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have broken a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011. In the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz.But officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program.Musk's vehicle was first to fly; Hurley and Behnken travelled to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft.""It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it,"" Hurley, 53, said at the beginning of May, before the flight.Behnken, 49, added: ""On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him.""Nasa chose two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends.""Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that,"" says Hurley.When they launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses knew exactly what they were going through. That's because they're astronauts too.Marine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel.Nyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas.""Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was,"" Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013.Air Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. As an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six.Hurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport.They ""can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be,"" Behnken told CNN before the launch. ""We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands.""Hurley says of Behnken: ""I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face."" But Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two.The older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. ""It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college,"" Hurley said in 2009.Behnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010, he described it as ""a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood"", adding: ""I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person.""He took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him. Both men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines.They both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven.""When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker',"" said Hurley. ""But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table.""Hurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms.Thus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay.When the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as the prime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard.""Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point,"" Hurley said this month.They've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels.Hurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX.""That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them,"" he explained.Setbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016. ""We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made,"" explained Hurley.Despite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remained undimmed: ""It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship.""Hurley told CNN: ""From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree.""But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",31 May 2020,science
Covid recovery could 'tip the balance' for nature,"Environmental scientists have called for the conservation of nature to be at the centre of the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.With countries still ensnared by the crisis, scientists have urged governments to make plans that ""safeguard biodiversity and human health"" as they rebuild. The researchers published an open letter in the journal Science.""How we emerge from lockdowns,"" they say, ""will drive a new world economy."" This is likely to have lasting effects on global biodiversity, the Australian authors argue.The right long-term plans, from governments and international organisations, could ""tip the balance"" in favour of nature. There are some striking examples of upheavals that have had unintended benefits for nature. The catastrophic nuclear accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine, and the resulting exclusion zone around the plant, created an unplanned wilderness that has since been designated an ecological reserve. ""The Colombia Conflict, for example, created unofficial protected areas,"" explained Dr Ryan Pearson from Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. ""This slowed environmental degradation because people were fearful of entering remote areas occupied by rebels.""The more recent ""post-conflict"" increase in deforestation there shows the need for longer-term strategies that can maintain the positive side effects of crises.""There have been many reports of wild animals increasing in numbers and turning up in places they haven't been seen i a long time,"" Dr Pearson told BBC News. "" This carries implications that certain species may be benefiting from the absence of human influence during lockdowns or possibly because of reduced pollution, especially in waterways.""We can't be sure how long such effects will last unless long-term strategies are implemented to encourage them.""There is, the scientists say, a concern that the rush to re-stabilise and grow economies may come ""at the expense of the environment"".This group of environmental scientists are adding their voices to a call for a greener focus as the world rebuilds. Dr Pearson added: ""We hope our letter will encourage positive strategies to support biodiversity into legislation, and the behaviour of people in their choices - in their consumption, investment, and travel.""Follow Victoria on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
SpaceX Nasa Mission: Astronauts on historic mission enter space station,"US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have docked with, and entered, the International Space Station (ISS).Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - attached to the bow section of the orbiting lab 422km above China.After a wait for leak, pressure and temperature checks, the pair disembarked to join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS.Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday.Theirs is the first crew outing launched from American soil since the retirement of the US space agency (Nasa) shuttles nine years ago. This is the first time in human history @NASA_Astronauts have entered the @Space_Station from a commercially-made spacecraft. @AstroBehnken and @Astro_Doug have finally arrived to the orbiting laboratory in @SpaceX's Dragon Endeavour spacecraft. pic.twitter.com/3t9Ogtpik4End of Twitter post  by @NASAThe mission marks the beginning of a new era in which Nasa will be purchasing transport services from the commercial sector. No more will it own and operate the American vehicles that run to and from the station.This will be done exclusively by firms such as SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk.Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST) on Sunday, 19 hours after leaving the Kennedy Space Center atop a Falcon rocket also provided by SpaceX.The docking was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach. The doors between Dragon and the ISS were opened at 17:02 GMT (18:02 BST). When Hurley and Behnken floated through, they were met by ISS Commander and fellow Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.""We're just happy to be here and Chris is going to put us work. And hopefully we will fit in and not mess too many things up,"" said Doug Hurley as he nursed a bruise picked up on his forehead. Bob Behnken said the pair were well rested and ready for the tasks ahead.""We did get probably a good seven hours or so (of sleep),"" he said in a radio link with mission control in Houston, Texas. ""The first night is always a little bit of a challenge, but the Dragon was a slick vehicle, and we had good air flow and so we had an excellent evening. (We're) just excited to be back in low-Earth orbit again.""Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine congratulated the duo on a job well done: ""The whole world saw this mission and we are so, so proud of everything you've done for our country and, in fact, to inspire the world.""SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans.Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers.SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract, which will encompass six astronaut ""taxi"" flights, with the first of these likely to occur at the end of August. Hurley's and Behnken's arrival at the ISS means they get to claim a Stars and Stripes flag placed on the platform by the members of the very last space shuttle mission in 2011.The Atlantis orbiter's crew left this flag as an incentive to all those that came after them. The flag, which also flew on the very first shuttle flight in 1981, will now be returned to Earth to be given to the mission that next goes beyond Earth orbit.  Earlier, Hurley and Behnken named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it ""Endeavour"", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s.It's somewhat uncertain how long Hurley and Behnken will stay at the ISS, but perhaps as much as four months.In that time, they will become members of the current ISS Expedition 63 crew, taking part in the platform's everyday science and maintenance activities.Chris Cassidy joked that because his new crewmates arrived on a Sunday, they had missed the cleaning chores that normally take place on a Saturday. ""We'll catch up next weekend,"" the commander said.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",31 May 2020,science
Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate,"The discovery of a new breeding pair raises hope for the survival of the world's rarest primate, the Hainan Gibbon.Ravaged by deforestation and poaching, the ape now lives only in a patch of forest on China's Hainan island.In the 1950s, there were an estimated 2,000 left in the world, but numbers fell to fewer than 10 in the 1970s.The latest census shows numbers have tripled to more than 30 gibbons, living in five separate family groups.The fragile recovery follows decades of work by the Hainan Gibbon Conservation Project, run by the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Hong Kong. ""I can't imagine how sad it would be if Hainan rainforest lost this beautiful animal and its wonderful song,"" said Philip Lo, senior conservation officer.Gibbons are known for their ability to swing gracefully through the forest canopy, making loud, haunting calls to mark their territory. Breeding adults sing duets at dawn to enhance bonding.Villagers heard the calls of two gibbons living in a part of the forest away from the main population late last year.A male and a female were later spotted, and heard singing together, showing they had formed a stable bond. The gibbon forms family groups consisting of one male, two females and their young offspring. The discovery of a fifth breeding pair in a separate fragment of forest is seen as highly significant.Philip Lo said the species remained the rarest primate in the world, but there is hope it could overcome the risk of extinction and recover steadily. He described the success as ""a piece of good news that could cheer up other dedicated conservation colleagues"".Conservation efforts have been under way at Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve since 2003, when the first full census found only 13 individuals living in two groups.A comprehensive rescue programme was put in place, including patrols and monitoring, research into the apes' ecology and behaviour, and the planting of thousands of trees to provide food and shelter.Nearly 20 gibbon species exist throughout the world, from northeastern India to Borneo. Most are under threat from the destruction of forests, hunting and illegal trade.Two species of gibbon have recently disappeared in China and all surviving Chinese species, including the Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), are classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.Follow Helen on Twitter.",1 June 2020,science
