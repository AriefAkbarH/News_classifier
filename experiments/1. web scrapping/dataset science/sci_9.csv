Pollution: Birds 'ingesting hundreds of bits of plastic a day',"Birds living on river banks are ingesting plastic at the rate of hundreds of tiny fragments a day, according to a new study.Scientists say this is the first clear evidence that plastic pollutants in rivers are finding their way into wildlife and moving up the food chain.Pieces of plastic 5mm or smaller (microplastics), including polyester, polypropylene and nylon, are known to pollute rivers. The impacts on wildlife are unclear. Researchers at Cardiff University looked at plastic pollutants found in a bird known as a dipper, which wades or dives into rivers in search of underwater insects.""These iconic birds, the dippers, are ingesting hundreds of pieces of plastic every day,"" said Prof Steve Ormerod of Cardiff University's Water Research Institute. ""They're also feeding this material to their chicks.""Previous research has shown that half of the insects in the rivers of south Wales contain microplastic fragments.""The fact that so many river insects are contaminated makes it inevitable that fish, birds and other predators will pick up these polluted prey - but this is the first time that this type of transfer through food webs has been shown clearly in free-living river animals,"" said co-researcher Dr Joseph D'Souza.The research team examined droppings and regurgitated pellets from dippers living near rivers running from the Brecon Beacons down to the Severn Estuary.They found microplastic fragments in roughly half of 166 samples taken from adults and nestlings, at 14 of 15 sites studied, with the greatest concentrations in urban locations. Most were fibres from textiles or building materials.Calculations suggest dippers are ingesting around 200 tiny fragments of plastic a day from the insects they consume.Previous studies have shown that microplastics are present even in the depths of the ocean and are ending up in the bodies of living organisms, from seals to crabs to seabirds.Rivers are a major route between land and sea for microplastics such as synthetic clothing fibres, tyre dust and other fragmenting plastic waste.

Nature: Bumblebees' 'clever trick' fools plants into flowering,"Scientists have discovered a new behaviour among bumblebees that tricks plants into flowering early. Researchers found that when deprived of pollen, bumblebees will nibble on the leaves of flowerless plants. The damage done seems to fool the plant into flowering, sometimes up to 30 days earlier than normal. Writing in the journal Science, the scientists say they have struggled to replicate the bees' trick in the laboratory.With their fuzzy appearance and distinctive drone, bumblebees are hard to miss in gardens all over the world. Their dense, hairy bodies make them excellent pollinators for crops like tomatoes and blueberries.They are among the first bees to emerge each year and work a long season. Some colonies remain active through the winter in southern and urban areas of the UK.But despite their key role, bumblebees, like many other pollinators have seen their numbers tumble in recent decades.One recent study pointed to climate change, reporting that an increasing number of hot days in Europe and North America was boosting local extinction rates. But researchers have now made a discovery about bumblebees that could have relevance to their long-term survival.Scientists in Switzerland found that when the bees were deprived of pollen, they started to nibble on the leaves of plants that hadn't yet flowered.The bees used their proboscises and mandibles (mouthparts) to cut distinctively-shaped holes in the leaves.But the creatures didn't eat the material or use it in their nests.The damaged plants responded by blooming earlier than normal - in some cases up to 30 days ahead of schedule.""I think everything that we've found is consistent with the idea that the bees are damaging the plants and that that's an adaptation that brings flowers online earlier and that benefits the bees,"" said Dr Mark Mescher, one of the authors from ETH Zurich, told BBC News.When the researchers tried to emulate the damage done to the plants by the bumblebees they weren't able to achieve the same results. The bee-damaged plants flowered 30 days earlier than undamaged plants and 25 days earlier than ones damaged by the scientists. The research team believes there may be something else going on here apart from nibbles.""We really tried to replicate with the best of our ability,"" said Prof Consuelo De Moraes, also from ETH Zurich.""It's possible that the bees also have some cue that they are providing to the plants that is specific to the bee.""""And that could be secretions that we don't know about but it's something that we plan to investigate.""The researchers say the damage has a particular pattern that the scientists have learned to recognise, even in the most unlikely places. ""You see these semi-circular sort of incisions, often in the leaf,"" said Dr Mescher. ""One of the students was saying that they were eating a salad the other day, and they saw that kind of damage on the leaf that was probably from a bumblebee.""The researchers say that when pollen is available the bees don't damage plants. They've also found this behaviour is in wild bees.However the team are keeping an open mind on whether the plants might be the ones in the driving seat. It is vital for plants that depend on pollination to have their flowers on display when the pollinators are buzzing around. It could be that some plants have evolved a strategy to push out their flowers when they recognise the bee doing damage to their leaves. Ultimately, though, knowing more about the relationship between bumblebees and flowering might have implications for the resilience of these creatures in the face of a changing environment.""I think it's fascinating how much we still don't know about organisms that we think we know really well,"" said Prof De Moraes.""It absolutely increases our sense of wonder at the cleverness of nature in all its many forms.""Follow Matt on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
Covid recovery could 'tip the balance' for nature,"Environmental scientists have called for the conservation of nature to be at the centre of the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.With countries still ensnared by the crisis, scientists have urged governments to make plans that ""safeguard biodiversity and human health"" as they rebuild. The researchers published an open letter in the journal Science.""How we emerge from lockdowns,"" they say, ""will drive a new world economy."" This is likely to have lasting effects on global biodiversity, the Australian authors argue.The right long-term plans, from governments and international organisations, could ""tip the balance"" in favour of nature. There are some striking examples of upheavals that have had unintended benefits for nature. The catastrophic nuclear accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine, and the resulting exclusion zone around the plant, created an unplanned wilderness that has since been designated an ecological reserve. ""The Colombia Conflict, for example, created unofficial protected areas,"" explained Dr Ryan Pearson from Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. ""This slowed environmental degradation because people were fearful of entering remote areas occupied by rebels.""The more recent ""post-conflict"" increase in deforestation there shows the need for longer-term strategies that can maintain the positive side effects of crises.""There have been many reports of wild animals increasing in numbers and turning up in places they haven't been seen i a long time,"" Dr Pearson told BBC News. "" This carries implications that certain species may be benefiting from the absence of human influence during lockdowns or possibly because of reduced pollution, especially in waterways.""We can't be sure how long such effects will last unless long-term strategies are implemented to encourage them.""There is, the scientists say, a concern that the rush to re-stabilise and grow economies may come ""at the expense of the environment"".This group of environmental scientists are adding their voices to a call for a greener focus as the world rebuilds. Dr Pearson added: ""We hope our letter will encourage positive strategies to support biodiversity into legislation, and the behaviour of people in their choices - in their consumption, investment, and travel.""Follow Victoria on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Astronauts get to work ahead of historic flight,"Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have flown into the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare for their historic mission next week.The pair's trip to the International Space Station (ISS) will be made in a rocket and capsule system provided by a commercial company, SpaceX. Nasa has traditionally always owned and operated its space vehicles.But that is a capability it gave up in 2011 when it retired the last of the space shuttles.The agency now intends to contract out all future crew transportation to low-Earth orbit.  Hurley and Behnken flew into Florida from the agency's human spaceflight headquarters in Texas where they have been in quarantine. They'll continue protecting their health at Kennedy as they get ready for next Wednesday's planned lift-off.Thursday will see teams from SpaceX and Nasa hold a flight readiness review to confirm all preparation activities are good to proceed.The astronauts' rocket, a Falcon-9, and capsule, known as Dragon, will be wheeled out to the spaceport's famous launch pad - complex 39A - shortly for its static fire test. This will see the Falcon ignite briefly all nine of its first-stage engines to check they are fit to go. Hurley and Behnken, together with ground-support staff, will also conduct a ""crew dry dress"" rehearsal.This will involve the men suiting up, riding out to the pad and even climbing into their capsule as a dummy run to ensure everyone understands their role.Of the Dragon, Hurley said: ""It's just an amazing vehicle. It's definitely not the space shuttle. It's much smaller; it's a capsule. It's state-of-the-art from a technology standpoint, and we are so excited to be in a real spaceship and not the simulator here in just a week.""Behnken said the pair felt the weight of history. This is only the fifth time American astronauts will have flown to orbit in a brand new spacecraft design.""We certainly take inspiration from all those who've come before us. Whenever we've had a chance to speak with the astronauts who had those opportunities - the thing they've emphasised is, in the moment, being as prepared and ready for whatever may come your way as possible,"" he told reporters at Kennedy.Next week's launch is key moment in Nasa's strategy to change the way it conducts its space activity. Its commercial crew programme, initiated in 2010, selected both SpaceX and aerospace heavyweight Boeing to develop crew transportation services.The arrangement with the companies means they can also sell seats in their vehicles to other space agencies, companies or indeed wealthy individuals.""We are on the cusp of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil yet again,"" explained Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.   ""This time we're doing it differently than we've ever done it before. We are partnering with commercial industry with the intent that they would go get customers that are not Nasa, and drive down our costs and increase the access to space.""For the moment, this model only covers flights to a few hundred kilometres above the Earth, to the ISS. But eventually the aim is to extend the concept to operations in deeper space.In April, Nasa asked three teams to develop ideas for landing its astronauts on the Moon. Again, this would be a service the agency would purchase. Lift-off for Hurley and Behnken next Wednesday is scheduled for 16:33 local time (21:33 BST/20:33 GMT).",21 May 2020,science
Sir Richard Branson: Virgin Orbit hopes for rocket flight this weekend,"British businessman Sir Richard Branson is looking to this weekend to debut one of his new space systems.Virgin Orbit, based in California, will put satellites above the Earth, using a rocket that's launched from under the wing of a jumbo jet.The maiden mission, to be conducted out over the Pacific Ocean, could take place as early as Saturday.Assuming this demonstration is successful, Virgin Orbit hopes to move swiftly into commercial operations.It already has a rocket built at its Long Beach factory for a second mission.There is an emerging market for small, lower-cost satellites, whose developers are seeking more flexible and affordable ways of getting their assets into space.Virgin Orbit is one of a number of companies now racing to meet this demand. Other contenders include the Rocket Lab outfit, which sends up its vehicles from a ground launch pad in New Zealand; but there are tens of other small rocket start-ups at various stages of development.Sir Richard had originally planned to run his satellite-launch business as part of his tourist spaceplane venture, known as Virgin Galactic, but decided eventually to split the projects into separate entities.The businessman will not be in California at the weekend to witness the demonstration. He'll be following events remotely. Virgin Orbit engineers will only proceed with the test mission if the weather over the Pacific launch zone is favourable. If it is, the former Virgin Atlantic jumbo, now named Cosmic Girl, will carry the rocket, dubbed LauncherOne, to an altitude of about 35,000ft (10km), where it will drop the liquid-fuelled booster into a freefall.Roughly four seconds into that fall, as Cosmic Girl banks hard to the right, LauncherOne will ignite its Newton Three engine to begin the climb to orbit. The dummy payload atop the rocket's upper-stage will be released after 32 minutes.The company is trying to dampen too much expectation. Maiden flights of rockets quite often discover unforeseen technical shortcomings and fail.""That's what the history of rockets tells us and we're ready for that, but we'll see how far we get,"" Will Pomerantz, Vice President of Special Projects at Virgin Orbit, said. ""As soon as that Newton engine ignites, we'll be learning,"" he told BBC News.The company had hoped to run this campaign earlier in the year but like all businesses has had to contend with coronavirus complications. Indeed, part of the Long Beach factory has been turned over to making ventilators for use in hospitals.Currently, flight operations are being run out of the Mojave Air and Space Port to the north of Los Angeles. But Virgin Orbit expects at some point to offer launches to customers in different locations around the world. Sir Richard and the British government have spoken of using Newquay in southwest England as a potential base. ",20 May 2020,science
Climate change: Top 10 tips to reduce carbon footprint revealed,"Climate change can still be tackled – but only if people are willing to embrace major shifts in the way we live, a report says.The authors have put together a list of the best ways for people to reduce their carbon footprints.The response to the Covid-19 crisis has shown that the public is willing to accept radical change if they consider it necessary, they explain.And the report adds that government priorities must be re-ordered.Protecting the planet must become the first duty of all decision-makers, the researchers argue.The authors urge the public to contribute by adopting the carbon-cutting measures in the report, which is based on an analysis of 7,000 other studies.Top of the list is living car-free, which saves an average of 2.04 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually. This is followed by driving a battery electric car - 1.95 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually - and taking one less long-haul flight each year - 1.68 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person.Switching to a vegan diet will help - but less than tackling transport, the research shows.It says popular activities such as recycling are worthwhile, but don’t cut emissions by as much.The lead author, Dr Diana Ivanova from Leeds University, told BBC News: “We need a complete change of mindset. “We have to agree how much carbon we can each emit within the limits of what the planet can bear – then make good lives within those boundaries.“The top 10 options are available to us now, without the need for controversial and expensive new technologies.” Dr Ivanova said the coronavirus lockdown has shown that many people could live without cars if public transport, walking and cycling were improved.Her research highlights rich people who typically take more flights, drive bigger cars and consume the most. She said: “All the world suffers from climate change, but it’s not the average person who flies regularly – it’s a small group, yet aviation is under-taxed. It’s a moral issue.”In her league table, buying renewable power and using public transport rank fourth and fifth.Sixth is insulating your home well, which saves 0.895 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.Seventh is switching to a vegan diet, which saves 0.8 tonnes. Other top actions are using heat pumps; switching from polluting cookstoves (in developing countries) to better methods of cooking, and heating buildings with renewable energy. Dr Ivanova said that if people implemented the measures, it would save around nine tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per person per year.Current annual household emissions are around 10 tonnes in the UK, and 17 in the US.The study, out soon in the journal Environmental Research Letters, says the following are worthwhile, but of lesser benefit to the climate: green roofs; using less paper; buying more durable items; turning down the thermostat - and recycling, which saves 0.01 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to Dr Ivanova.Some of the findings will be questioned. Polls suggest some people think climate is as important as the virus, for instance, but some don’t.Professor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “This is a valuable study. But it only looks at the carbon footprint and not at other impacts like water scarcity because of lithium mining for electric car batteries.Libby Peake, from the Green Alliance think tank, told BBC News: “People shouldn’t stop good habits like recycling, which saves some carbon while preventing waste and conserving resources.”  “Better design allows people to buy fewer but higher-quality things and to live in buildings with lower carbon footprints. These savings aren’t necessarily covered by this study.” Follow Roger on Twitter.",20 May 2020,science

Other top actions are using heat pumps; switching from polluting cookstoves (in developing countries) to better methods of cooking, and heating buildings with renewable energy. Dr Ivanova said that if people implemented the measures, it would save around nine tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per person per year.Current annual household emissions are around 10 tonnes in the UK, and 17 in the US.The study, out soon in the journal Environmental Research Letters, says the following are worthwhile, but of lesser benefit to the climate: green roofs; using less paper; buying more durable items; turning down the thermostat - and recycling, which saves 0.01 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to Dr Ivanova.Some of the findings will be questioned.

But it only looks at the carbon footprint and not at other impacts like water scarcity because of lithium mining for electric car batteries.Libby Peake, from the Green Alliance think tank, told BBC News: “People shouldn’t stop good habits like recycling, which saves some carbon while preventing waste and conserving resources.”  “Better design allows people to buy fewer but higher-quality things and to live in buildings with lower carbon footprints.

Nature: Bumblebees' 'clever trick' fools plants into flowering,"Scientists have discovered a new behaviour among bumblebees that tricks plants into flowering early. Researchers found that when deprived of pollen, bumblebees will nibble on the leaves of flowerless plants. The damage done seems to fool the plant into flowering, sometimes up to 30 days earlier than normal. Writing in the journal Science, the scientists say they have struggled to replicate the bees' trick in the laboratory.With their fuzzy appearance and distinctive drone, bumblebees are hard to miss in gardens all over the world. Their dense, hairy bodies make them excellent pollinators for crops like tomatoes and blueberries.They are among the first bees to emerge each year and work a long season. Some colonies remain active through the winter in southern and urban areas of the UK.But despite their key role, bumblebees, like many other pollinators have seen their numbers tumble in recent decades.One recent study pointed to climate change, reporting that an increasing number of hot days in Europe and North America was boosting local extinction rates. But researchers have now made a discovery about bumblebees that could have relevance to their long-term survival.Scientists in Switzerland found that when the bees were deprived of pollen, they started to nibble on the leaves of plants that hadn't yet flowered.The bees used their proboscises and mandibles (mouthparts) to cut distinctively-shaped holes in the leaves.But the creatures didn't eat the material or use it in their nests.The damaged plants responded by blooming earlier than normal - in some cases up to 30 days ahead of schedule.""I think everything that we've found is consistent with the idea that the bees are damaging the plants and that that's an adaptation that brings flowers online earlier and that benefits the bees,"" said Dr Mark Mescher, one of the authors from ETH Zurich, told BBC News.When the researchers tried to emulate the damage done to the plants by the bumblebees they weren't able to achieve the same results. The bee-damaged plants flowered 30 days earlier than undamaged plants and 25 days earlier than ones damaged by the scientists. The research team believes there may be something else going on here apart from nibbles.""We really tried to replicate with the best of our ability,"" said Prof Consuelo De Moraes, also from ETH Zurich.""It's possible that the bees also have some cue that they are providing to the plants that is specific to the bee.""""And that could be secretions that we don't know about but it's something that we plan to investigate.""The researchers say the damage has a particular pattern that the scientists have learned to recognise, even in the most unlikely places. ""You see these semi-circular sort of incisions, often in the leaf,"" said Dr Mescher. ""One of the students was saying that they were eating a salad the other day, and they saw that kind of damage on the leaf that was probably from a bumblebee.""The researchers say that when pollen is available the bees don't damage plants. They've also found this behaviour is in wild bees.However the team are keeping an open mind on whether the plants might be the ones in the driving seat. It is vital for plants that depend on pollination to have their flowers on display when the pollinators are buzzing around. It could be that some plants have evolved a strategy to push out their flowers when they recognise the bee doing damage to their leaves. Ultimately, though, knowing more about the relationship between bumblebees and flowering might have implications for the resilience of these creatures in the face of a changing environment.""I think it's fascinating how much we still don't know about organisms that we think we know really well,"" said Prof De Moraes.""It absolutely increases our sense of wonder at the cleverness of nature in all its many forms.""Follow Matt on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
Covid recovery could 'tip the balance' for nature,"Environmental scientists have called for the conservation of nature to be at the centre of the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.With countries still ensnared by the crisis, scientists have urged governments to make plans that ""safeguard biodiversity and human health"" as they rebuild. The researchers published an open letter in the journal Science.""How we emerge from lockdowns,"" they say, ""will drive a new world economy."" This is likely to have lasting effects on global biodiversity, the Australian authors argue.The right long-term plans, from governments and international organisations, could ""tip the balance"" in favour of nature. There are some striking examples of upheavals that have had unintended benefits for nature. The catastrophic nuclear accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine, and the resulting exclusion zone around the plant, created an unplanned wilderness that has since been designated an ecological reserve. ""The Colombia Conflict, for example, created unofficial protected areas,"" explained Dr Ryan Pearson from Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. ""This slowed environmental degradation because people were fearful of entering remote areas occupied by rebels.""The more recent ""post-conflict"" increase in deforestation there shows the need for longer-term strategies that can maintain the positive side effects of crises.""There have been many reports of wild animals increasing in numbers and turning up in places they haven't been seen i a long time,"" Dr Pearson told BBC News. "" This carries implications that certain species may be benefiting from the absence of human influence during lockdowns or possibly because of reduced pollution, especially in waterways.""We can't be sure how long such effects will last unless long-term strategies are implemented to encourage them.""There is, the scientists say, a concern that the rush to re-stabilise and grow economies may come ""at the expense of the environment"".This group of environmental scientists are adding their voices to a call for a greener focus as the world rebuilds. Dr Pearson added: ""We hope our letter will encourage positive strategies to support biodiversity into legislation, and the behaviour of people in their choices - in their consumption, investment, and travel.""Follow Victoria on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Astronauts get to work ahead of historic flight,"Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have flown into the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare for their historic mission next week.The pair's trip to the International Space Station (ISS) will be made in a rocket and capsule system provided by a commercial company, SpaceX. Nasa has traditionally always owned and operated its space vehicles.But that is a capability it gave up in 2011 when it retired the last of the space shuttles.The agency now intends to contract out all future crew transportation to low-Earth orbit.  Hurley and Behnken flew into Florida from the agency's human spaceflight headquarters in Texas where they have been in quarantine. They'll continue protecting their health at Kennedy as they get ready for next Wednesday's planned lift-off.Thursday will see teams from SpaceX and Nasa hold a flight readiness review to confirm all preparation activities are good to proceed.The astronauts' rocket, a Falcon-9, and capsule, known as Dragon, will be wheeled out to the spaceport's famous launch pad - complex 39A - shortly for its static fire test. This will see the Falcon ignite briefly all nine of its first-stage engines to check they are fit to go. Hurley and Behnken, together with ground-support staff, will also conduct a ""crew dry dress"" rehearsal.This will involve the men suiting up, riding out to the pad and even climbing into their capsule as a dummy run to ensure everyone understands their role.Of the Dragon, Hurley said: ""It's just an amazing vehicle. It's definitely not the space shuttle. It's much smaller; it's a capsule. It's state-of-the-art from a technology standpoint, and we are so excited to be in a real spaceship and not the simulator here in just a week.""Behnken said the pair felt the weight of history. This is only the fifth time American astronauts will have flown to orbit in a brand new spacecraft design.""We certainly take inspiration from all those who've come before us. Whenever we've had a chance to speak with the astronauts who had those opportunities - the thing they've emphasised is, in the moment, being as prepared and ready for whatever may come your way as possible,"" he told reporters at Kennedy.Next week's launch is key moment in Nasa's strategy to change the way it conducts its space activity. Its commercial crew programme, initiated in 2010, selected both SpaceX and aerospace heavyweight Boeing to develop crew transportation services.The arrangement with the companies means they can also sell seats in their vehicles to other space agencies, companies or indeed wealthy individuals.""We are on the cusp of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil yet again,"" explained Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.   ""This time we're doing it differently than we've ever done it before. We are partnering with commercial industry with the intent that they would go get customers that are not Nasa, and drive down our costs and increase the access to space.""For the moment, this model only covers flights to a few hundred kilometres above the Earth, to the ISS. But eventually the aim is to extend the concept to operations in deeper space.In April, Nasa asked three teams to develop ideas for landing its astronauts on the Moon. Again, this would be a service the agency would purchase. Lift-off for Hurley and Behnken next Wednesday is scheduled for 16:33 local time (21:33 BST/20:33 GMT).",21 May 2020,science
Sir Richard Branson: Virgin Orbit hopes for rocket flight this weekend,"British businessman Sir Richard Branson is looking to this weekend to debut one of his new space systems.Virgin Orbit, based in California, will put satellites above the Earth, using a rocket that's launched from under the wing of a jumbo jet.The maiden mission, to be conducted out over the Pacific Ocean, could take place as early as Saturday.Assuming this demonstration is successful, Virgin Orbit hopes to move swiftly into commercial operations.It already has a rocket built at its Long Beach factory for a second mission.There is an emerging market for small, lower-cost satellites, whose developers are seeking more flexible and affordable ways of getting their assets into space.Virgin Orbit is one of a number of companies now racing to meet this demand. Other contenders include the Rocket Lab outfit, which sends up its vehicles from a ground launch pad in New Zealand; but there are tens of other small rocket start-ups at various stages of development.Sir Richard had originally planned to run his satellite-launch business as part of his tourist spaceplane venture, known as Virgin Galactic, but decided eventually to split the projects into separate entities.The businessman will not be in California at the weekend to witness the demonstration. He'll be following events remotely. Virgin Orbit engineers will only proceed with the test mission if the weather over the Pacific launch zone is favourable. If it is, the former Virgin Atlantic jumbo, now named Cosmic Girl, will carry the rocket, dubbed LauncherOne, to an altitude of about 35,000ft (10km), where it will drop the liquid-fuelled booster into a freefall.Roughly four seconds into that fall, as Cosmic Girl banks hard to the right, LauncherOne will ignite its Newton Three engine to begin the climb to orbit. The dummy payload atop the rocket's upper-stage will be released after 32 minutes.The company is trying to dampen too much expectation. Maiden flights of rockets quite often discover unforeseen technical shortcomings and fail.""That's what the history of rockets tells us and we're ready for that, but we'll see how far we get,"" Will Pomerantz, Vice President of Special Projects at Virgin Orbit, said. ""As soon as that Newton engine ignites, we'll be learning,"" he told BBC News.The company had hoped to run this campaign earlier in the year but like all businesses has had to contend with coronavirus complications. Indeed, part of the Long Beach factory has been turned over to making ventilators for use in hospitals.Currently, flight operations are being run out of the Mojave Air and Space Port to the north of Los Angeles. But Virgin Orbit expects at some point to offer launches to customers in different locations around the world. Sir Richard and the British government have spoken of using Newquay in southwest England as a potential base. ",20 May 2020,science
Climate change: Top 10 tips to reduce carbon footprint revealed,"Climate change can still be tackled – but only if people are willing to embrace major shifts in the way we live, a report says.The authors have put together a list of the best ways for people to reduce their carbon footprints.The response to the Covid-19 crisis has shown that the public is willing to accept radical change if they consider it necessary, they explain.And the report adds that government priorities must be re-ordered.Protecting the planet must become the first duty of all decision-makers, the researchers argue.The authors urge the public to contribute by adopting the carbon-cutting measures in the report, which is based on an analysis of 7,000 other studies.Top of the list is living car-free, which saves an average of 2.04 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually. This is followed by driving a battery electric car - 1.95 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually - and taking one less long-haul flight each year - 1.68 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person.Switching to a vegan diet will help - but less than tackling transport, the research shows.It says popular activities such as recycling are worthwhile, but don’t cut emissions by as much.The lead author, Dr Diana Ivanova from Leeds University, told BBC News: “We need a complete change of mindset. “We have to agree how much carbon we can each emit within the limits of what the planet can bear – then make good lives within those boundaries.“The top 10 options are available to us now, without the need for controversial and expensive new technologies.” Dr Ivanova said the coronavirus lockdown has shown that many people could live without cars if public transport, walking and cycling were improved.Her research highlights rich people who typically take more flights, drive bigger cars and consume the most.

Leaky component led to SpaceX explosion,"A leaky component may have been to blame for the dramatic explosion of a SpaceX capsule during testing in April.No one was hurt in the ground test at Cape Canaveral in Florida, but the failure was a setback in the company's efforts to send astronauts to the International Space Station.Currently, the US buys seats for its astronauts on the Russian Soyuz rocket.Nasa is planning to hand over the transport of astronauts to and from the ISS to Elon Musk's SpaceX and Boeing.It's doing this under something called the Commercial Crew Programme.The preliminary findings of the SpaceX analysis suggest that the leaking component allowed a small amount of nitrogen tetroxide (NTO), which is used as a liquid oxidiser in spacecraft engines, to enter high pressure tubes meant for helium.On 20 April at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, engineers were conducting something called a static fire engine test, where the spacecraft is secured to the ground and its engines are fired at full thrust. SpaceX was checking the vehicle's propulsion systems prior to a planned test of the in-flight emergency abort system.A small amount of NTO was driven at high speed through a helium check valve (one that allows gas to flow in just one direction). The check valve was made of titanium. This happened during initialisation of the launch escape system - which is designed to blast the crew free in the event of a rocket failure. In a statement, the company said: ""The failure of the titanium component in a high-pressure NTO environment was sufficient to cause ignition of the check valve and led to an explosion.""It added: ""The reaction between titanium and NTO at high pressure was not expected.""As a result of the explosion, SpaceX has already taken several actions, including the use of components called burst disks instead of check valves. The burst disks seal completely until opened by high pressure. The company believes this will prevent any liquid propellant entering the gaseous pressurisation system.In an interview with the C-SPAN television network on 12 July, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine, said: ""This was a test. This is why we test. Ultimately, we find out what went wrong, we make adjustments and we move forward. That's what Nasa has always done, that's what we expect our commercial crew partners to do. They are doing it.""SpaceX has been criticised for a perceived lack of openness in the wake of the explosion. Jim Bridenstine said there was now a new procedure in place in the event that something similar happens again.""Within a couple of hours, we're going to do a press conference and get as much information out to the public as soon as possible,"" he explained.The company has had to rearrange its spacecraft assignments as a result of the test failure, in order to stay on track for its Commercial Crew Programme flights. The Crew Dragon originally assigned to SpaceX's demonstration mission to the ISS (known as Demo-2) will carry out the company's in-flight abort test. The spacecraft originally assigned to the first operational mission (known as Crew-1) will launch on Demo-2.Demo-2 will ferry Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the ISS for the first crewed test flight of the vehicle. It would mark the first time US astronauts have launched to space from American soil since the last flight of the space shuttle in July 2011.The plan had been to launch the mission at the end of this year. But officials currently won't commit to whether that goal can be achieved.Jim Bridenstine told C-SPAN: ""I don't want to comment on whether or not we will get that flight complete this year,"" adding: ""We need to do it as soon as possible.""It is expected to be followed by the first crewed flight of Boeing's spacecraft, the CST-100 Starliner. Astronauts Michael Fincke, Christopher Ferguson and Nicole Aunapu Mann will fly on the first crewed test of the Starliner.Follow Paul on Twitter.",16 July 2019,science
Climate change: Future floods will delay emergency response,"Future increases in rainfall in England could significantly impact emergency responses, according to a new study.Researchers say that flood conditions could see just 9% of some rural populations reached by an ambulance within the 7-15 minute mandatory timeframe.Older people living in rural areas would be worst affected, the authors say.They say there should be a rethink on ambulance locations in flooding events.Flooding is one of the most devastating impacts of climate change. According to studies, it is likely to increase in the future. The Met Office has indicated that an extended period of extreme rainfall in winter, similar to what was seen in parts of England between 2013 and 2014 is now about seven times more likely because of human-induced climate change. To find out how this changing rainfall might impact on ambulance and fire and rescue services, researchers projected the impacts of floods that might occur once in 30 years, once in 100 years and once in 1,000 years.In England, emergency responders must reach urgent cases within mandatory timeframes, regardless of the weather conditions. In normal conditions, around 84% of England's population can be reached by ambulance in around seven minutes. The researchers found that when a once in 30-year flood event struck, this dropped to 67%. With a once in a 100-year flood, just over half the population would be reachable in seven minutes, while in a once in a 1,000-year flood, only 27% of the total population would see an ambulance inside that time limit.Different locations had different outcomes according to the study. East Riding and Berkshire would see their coverage reduce to 9% and 12% respectively. ""Even the small magnitude floods affect the emergency response,"" said lead author Prof Dapeng Yu from Loughborough University.""Ambulance services have been centralised in recent decades, so in villages or small towns there's no ambulance service, therefore when an incident happens in rural areas, it takes a lot longer for them to reach.""As well as rural areas, large urban centres including London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Newcastle, would also see a reduction in response time under a 30-year flood.Care homes, sheltered accommodation, nurseries and schools would be among the most vulnerable locations with older people in rural areas likely worst-hit, according to the study. The authors say that the day of the Brexit referendum on 23 June in 2016 is a good example of what can happen to the emergency services during surface flooding events. Referendum day was memorable for large-scale surface flooding in many parts of London after torrential rain.Around 450 flooding incidents were attended by the London Fire and Rescue Service, which was three times the number from the previous day.The London fire service target timeframe for reaching incidents is six minutes and on June 23, 59% of journeys were outside that target. ""You don't know when it's going to hit and you don't know how hard it is going to hit,"" said Prof Dapeng Yu.""But when it happens, like in London during the referendum day, it is really striking.""""It really shows the impacts, you will receive three times more calls than normal and your ability to reach them in six minutes is massively compromised.""The authors say that their study shows that the emergency services are particularly sensitive to the expected impacts of future increases in rainfall. The impacts would be greater with surface flooding events rather than with river or coastal flooding.Preventing unnecessary delays in the future will require planners to identify hotspots of vulnerability and to re-think the distribution of ambulances and fire stations. ""With climate change, flooding will likely become more frequent and more intense,""said Prof Dapeng Yu.""So certainly, when the authorities consider the strategic plan for new ambulance stations or fire stations, they need to consider this factor.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Sustainability.Follow Matt on Twitter.",18 May 2020,science
How coronavirus is driving a revolution in travel,"Barriers closed a stretch of Deansgate, Manchester's main thoroughfare, to motor vehicles on Saturday.Elsewhere in the city, new pedestrian walkways and pop-up bike lanes have appeared. It is part of a nationwide effort to create more space for social distancing as the country gradually begins to lift the coronavirus restrictions.Glasgow, Leicester, York and Brighton have also created new space for walking or cycling this week.And dozens more UK towns and cities plan to do so.On Friday, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he would be shutting some of the busiest roads in the city.He said his plan to close large swathes of London to cars and vans would create one of the largest car-free areas of any city in the world.""Many Londoners have rediscovered the joys of walking and cycling during lockdown"", Mr Khan said.  ""By quickly and cheaply widening pavements, creating temporary cycle lanes and closing roads to through traffic we will enable millions more people to change the way they get around our city.""He acknowledged that the changes would cause disruption for many Londoners but said he had no choice but to rapidly repurpose London's streets for people.""By ensuring our city's recovery is green, we will also tackle our toxic air, which is vital to make sure we don't replace one public health crisis with another.""Most of the changes being brought in around the country are a temporary response to the coronavirus crisis, but many local authorities say that - following consultation with local communities - they would like to make them permanent. ""We hope that pedestrians and cyclists will reclaim the streets of this city"", councillor Angeliki Stogia, Manchester's lead member for Transport and Environment, told the BBC.  The coronavirus crisis has allowed many projects to be fast-tracked.""Some of the projects Manchester is introducing have been in the planning process for years,"" she said.The government has acknowledged that resolving how we can travel while maintaining social distancing is one of the biggest challenges it faces as it starts to lift the lockdown.The current message is: don't use public transport if you can avoid it, yet if people take to their cars, our streets will be choked with traffic.Last week, the government announced what it called a ""once in a generation"" investment to change the way Britain gets around.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps ordered English local authorities to make ""significant changes"" to give more space to pedestrians and cyclists.He said he would be setting up a £250 million emergency fund to encourage what he called ""active travel"".Mr Shapps said the money was the first instalment of a £2bn package for cycling and walking, part of a £5bn investment announced in February.Councils can already use temporary traffic orders to widen pavements, install cycle lanes, create new zebra crossings and close entire streets to traffic, and Mr Shapps has said he will enhance their powers.It means local authorities have the ability to completely alter the way traffic moves through a town or city.But most of the new measures involve restricting car and other motor vehicle access.Some motorists see what is happening as a land grab, conducted under the cover of covid and designed to create ""new facts on the ground"".""What is worrying about this is that it feels anti-motorist, anti-cars, anti-lorries, anti-vans"", says Rod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association.  ""All those methods of transport are essential for economic recovery, so don't punish one group at the expense of the other"", he urges.Manchester has dubbed its campaign to encourage walking and cycling ""Safe Streets Save Lives"".The city says it will use £5m of emergency funding to introduce changes where they are most needed, so outside shops, transport hubs or on routes to hospitals.The aim is that these initiatives will help achieve the authority's goal of making the city carbon-neutral by 2038 as well as creating a healthier, more pleasant city.The focus is not just on the city centre.Levenshulme in south-east Manchester will see some of the most dramatic traffic calming measures in the entire region.The plan is that 30 traffic filters made of heavy concrete flower pots and bollards will close much of the neighbourhood to through traffic over the next few weeks.""We have consulted with the community and they say want to make this area a nicer place to live"", says Levenshulme resident Pauline Johnson. She said the response from local people has been overwhelmingly positive.""They say they want this to be somewhere where children can play safely in the streets.""Greater Manchester's cycling commissioner Chris Boardman, says cycling has increased by more than 70% on some days since the lockdown in the region.""What coronavirus has shown is that if you give people safe, traffic free streets they will walk more and ride bikes"", he told the BBC.""If we don't take steps to enable people to keep traveling actively, we risk a huge spike in car use as measures are eased"", the Olympic gold winner said.""Not only is it the right thing to do to protect people now, but it's vital to meet our clean air goals and protect our NHS long-term.""Lockdown has certainly prompted a boom in bike sales. At one point this week shares in Halfords, the country's biggest chain of cycle shops, had jumped 17%.The company said sales of some cycling equipment had risen 500% since the government ordered us all to stay at home on March 23rd.Ken Foster says his bike shop, Foster's Cycles, in the Manchester suburb of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, is the busiest it has been since his grandfather opened it back in 1954.But it has been exceptionally good weather.  What happens when it rains?""There is no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing"", says Ken Foster with a laugh.Follow Justin on Twitter.",16 May 2020,science
Ozone layer: Concern grows over threat from replacement chemicals,"Substances used for air conditioning in almost all new cars are building up in the environment and may pose a threat to human health, researchers say.These ""ozone friendly"" chemicals have been introduced to replace products that were damaging the ozone layer.Now widely used across industry, these alternatives do not break down in the environment.Scientists have now found increasing levels of these chemicals in Arctic ice samples dating back to the 1990s. The Montreal Protocol is regarded as one of the most successful environmental treaties ever adopted.Signed back in 1987, it committed countries to regulate their use of chlorofluorocarbon chemicals (CFCs) that had recently been found to be depleting the ozone layer. A growing hole in the ozone over Antarctica had been detected in the mid-1980s and there was serious concern about the threat it posed to human health.CFCs were then widely used in refrigeration, in air conditioning, as solvents and in aerosol sprays.In the intervening decades, alternative products that are less harmful to the ozone layer were introduced. As a result, researchers have reported progress in reducing the size of the hole.However, there are now concerns that the solution may be inadvertently damaging the environment and threatening human health.Canadian researchers, studying ice samples from the Arctic dating back to the 1990s, have found ""dramatically"" increasing levels of ozone replacements called short chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (scPFCAs).""We're seeing much, much larger levels, on the order of 10 times higher now than we saw before the Montreal Protocol,"" said Prof Cora Young, from York University in Toronto, the study's corresponding author.""We don't know a lot about them and their potential toxicity, but we do know that we are committing the environment to a great deal of contamination.""The compounds being detected in the Arctic are in the same class as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, sometimes called the ""forever chemicals"".These long-lasting chemicals are found in everything, from furniture to clothing to food wrapping to drinking water. There is growing concern about the role of PFAS in serious health conditions including cancer, liver damage and decreased fertility.The related products, found in the Arctic ice samples, do not break down in the environment and current water filtration technology is unable to remove them.The scientists expect levels of scPFCAS to increase markedly in the future.As part of the efforts to replace CFCs, car manufacturers around the world agreed to use a different coolant in air conditioning called HFC-134a which was introduced in 1992. While HFC-134a was less damaging to the ozone layer, it was unfortunately a very powerful greenhouse gas, around 1,400 times more warming that CO2. So manufacturers in the US and Europe agreed to phase out HFC-134a and by 2017 all new cars had to use a different coolant for air conditioning called HFO-1234yf.While this chemical doesn't damage ozone, and is not a greenhouse gas, it does unfortunately break down to produce short chain PFCAs.""It has a very low global warming potential, but has a much higher propensity to form these persistent products,"" said Prof Young. ""It will be again another shift, where we see an even more dramatic increase.""According to the researchers, these chemicals can travel a long distance in the atmosphere and often end up in lakes and rivers.

Social distancing: When extreme weather and coronavirus collide,"People being displaced by extreme weather events around the world are being forced to break Covid-19 social distancing safety guidelines, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and other humanitarian agencies.“Social distancing is no longer possible when displaced people are in evacuation centres,” Marshal Makavure, emergency operations co-ordinator of IFRC in Eastern Africa told the BBC.“People have been forced to break the Covid-19 protocol and guidelines under such circumstances.”The BBC has spoken with people living in areas affected by extreme weather events.Subrat Kumar Padhihary, a 38-year-old farmer in Odisha state on India’s east coast, is worried.Indian officials are on alert as Cyclone Amphan, due to hit West Bengal and Odisha on Wednesday, looks likely to intensify into a ""very severe"" storm.Subrat’s village is nearly 40 kilometres from the sea. The house that he shares with his wife, three daughters and mother was badly damaged by Cyclone Fani last year, so he isn’t convinced it can withstand Cyclone Amphan.But even if his house survives, he’s worried about having to leave his village if the authorities say people must evacuate.Subrat feels that might be even more dangerous.“My fear is that we will be taken to nearby schools that have already been turned into Covid-19 quarantine shelters.“There are not many centres in our village, and that means we will have to share the space with people [who may have Covid-19] which will be full of risks.”“West Bengal state has been struggling with Covid-19 cases and that is a cause of concern when it comes to cyclone preparedness,” according to Siddarth Srinivas, food and climate policy lead for Oxfam in Asia.“In the past, some states in India have rescued people by sheltering them in schools and public buildings, but this time doing that is not ideal because of the pandemic.”The Kasese district in western Uganda has been one of the worst hit by recent floods, with hundreds of people displaced.Joseline Kabugho is six months pregnant. The 23 year old has been forced to shelter with her two children in one of the school-turned-camps in the district.She’s staying at the shelter, even though her pregnancy means she is in a high-risk group when it comes to Covid-19 infection. There are nearly 200 displaced people with her at the shelter.“We are so vulnerable now,” she said from a class shared with three other families, which is now her family’s temporary home. “I can’t stay away from other people because of the limited space.“I am worried that I may get the virus, and I am worried about my kids, and my unborn baby,” she told the BBC.Joseline was sleeping next to her two children on the night of 7 May, when she heard other people in her village screaming.“I realised later on that my neighbours were actually telling me to run for my life. The entire village had been hit by a massive flood.“I grabbed my two kids and ran away, I had no time to take anything else.""She had bought some clothes for her unborn baby before the floods. “I could not even save those clothes. The floods took them all.“Whatever we had was swept away.""Her husband works in another district and he has been unable to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions. “I have nowhere to go and I don’t know what to do next.”Relief workers with the Red Cross say thousands of people are now sheltering in churches and schools in flood-hit East Africa with limited access to water and soap.Hundreds have died and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the floods in more than a half a dozen countries.More than 2,700 Covid-19 deaths and nearly 82,000 confirmed cases have been recorded in Africa, according to John Hopkins University.Among the flood affected countries in East Africa, Somalia has the highest death figure of 55, followed by 50 in Kenya and 21 in Tanzania.Tropical cyclone Harold hit Pacific island countries more than a month ago.Some affected countries had to lift Covid-19 restrictions to allow people to take refuge in evacuation centres. Some people are still in evacuation centres now because the pandemic is affecting aid efforts.The worst-hit country, Vanuatu, has extended the state of emergency as more than 92,000 people have been affected, according to Unicef.In Fiji, about 10 evacuation centres are operating because recovery has been very slow and many houses are yet to be rebuilt.“Access to water is still a big challenge as the cyclone has destroyed water supply infrastructures,” said Vani Catanasiga, director of Fiji Council of Social Services.“Without adequate water supply, following Covid-19 hygiene guidelines is very difficult, although the Fijian government has been successful in flattening the Covid-19 infection curve.”Humanitarian agencies say relief operations can help in enforcing Covid-19 guidelines.Red Cross relief worker Irene Nakasiits is distributing water and soap as essentials to the flood-displaced communities in western Uganda.“Although it is challenging to do so, we can still remind affected communities to follow the guidelines,” according to Marshal Mukuvare of the IFRC.“We can have messages written on food and other relief materials, which we distribute in affected places.“This helps people do what they can, even in such adverse conditions.”It’s uncharted territory, according to Siddarth Srinivas, Food and Climate policy lead for Oxfam in Asia. “When it comes to how to deal with extreme weather and a pandemic like Covid-19, the debate has just started.“It needs much more thinking before we come up with solid measures.”  ",20 May 2020,science
Meet the baby orangutans learning to climb trees,"While much of the world is in lockdown, youngsters in one very unusual classroom are still having lessons.At a forest school in Borneo, baby orangutans learn tree-climbing skills from their human surrogate parents.The orphans spend 12 hours a day in the forest, preparing for a new life in the wild.The orangutans were filmed and photographed before coronavirus struck, for the TV series Primates, on BBC One.With human contact routinely kept to a minimum, life goes on much as before for the animals, says Dr Signe Preuschoft, leader of ape programmes for the charity Four Paws, which runs the rehabilitation centre in East Kalimantan.As a precaution, the staff now have temperature checks, wear facemasks and change into uniforms on site.The pandemic has disrupted many conservation programmes around the world but Dr Preuschoft says it also offers an opportunity to bring positive change.""There are great opportunities here to protect wildlife better from illegal wildlife trade and from (consumption of) bushmeat,"" she says. ""It's very much about education.""The young orphaned apes climb high into the treetops with their caregivers to help them acquire the skills they would have learned from their mothers in the wild.They would otherwise spend more time on the ground than is natural for a species that feeds, lives and sleeps in the canopies of trees.Baby orangutans have a huge advantage when it comes to climbing, as they can hold on ""like an octopus"", says Dr Preuschoft.""I think the orangutans were really completely thrilled when they realised that they could actually be in a canopy together with one of their moms,"" she adds. As soon as the rescued orangutans have moved out of quarantine, they spend long hours in the forest in as natural an environment as possible. They are taught essential forest survival skills in a large forested area between the cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda.The aim is to provide sanctuary to illegally captured or directly threatened orangutans, as well as to rehabilitate orphaned orangutans, with the goal of releasing them back into the wild. Only about 50,000 Bornean orangutans are left in the world, with numbers plummeting over the last 70 years. Loss of rainforest to oil palm plantations or coal mining leads orangutans into conflict with humans. Orphans are snatched from their dead mothers and are sold or held illegally as pets. The third and last episode of Primates airs this Sunday at 20.15 BST on BBC One and on BBC iPlayer.Follow Helen on Twitter.",17 May 2020,science
Mars: Mud flows on Red Planet behave like 'boiling toothpaste',"Scientists have made a surprising discovery about Mars by playing with muck in the laboratory. An international team of researchers wondered how volcanoes that spew mud instead of molten rock might look on the Red Planet compared with their counterparts here on Earth. In chamber experiments, simulated Martian mud flows were seen to behave a bit like boiling toothpaste. Under certain conditions, the fluid even began to bounce.The mucky gunge resembled a certain type of lava referred to as ""pahoehoe"", which is observed at Hawaii's famous Kīlauea volcano.The research results could now complicate some investigations at the Red Planet, believes study lead Dr Petr Brož from the Czech Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geophysics.""You'll look at some features [from space] and you won't know for sure whether they are the result of lava flows or mud flows.""Without a geologist on the ground to hit them with a hammer, it will be hard to tell,"" he told BBC News.For a long time, Dr Brož had a sceptical view about mud volcanoes on Mars. The phenomena are well known here on Earth, but he'd actually spent several years trying to disprove an interpretation that large numbers of conical forms on the Red Planet might also be the same thing.Eventually, he came around to the idea, and that led him to wonder how mud - if it really does spew from the ground on Mars - would behave in the extreme cold and low-pressure conditions that persist there. This took him to Dr Manish Patel and his team at the UK's Open University. They have a special chamber that can recreate the Martian environment.It's the kind of set-up in which equipment destined to go on a space agency rover would be tested.  And although ordinarily every effort would be made to keep the chamber spotlessly clean, the researchers soon found themselves tipping experimental muddy fluids down a sandy slope.Under ""Earth conditions"", these muddy mixes behave as you would expect: they're smooth, like gravy poured on to a dinner plate. But under ""Martian conditions"", the mud progresses via a series of ropy and jagged lobes.It all comes down to how the low atmospheric pressure - less than 1% of the Earth's value - makes water rapidly evaporate, boil and ultimately freeze.""The skin on the fluid freezes, but this flow is thick enough that the inside remains fluid,"" explained Dr Patel. ""So the skin will stop the flow for a bit, but then the momentum from the fluid inside breaks through at weak points in the skin, and the flow propagates forward. It's just like pahoehoe, except that's molten rock. But again, it's a cooling skin that forms before hot material bursts through.""The team reports its initial experiments in a paper in the journal Nature Geoscience. Not captured in this publication are subsequent experiments in which the flows were repeated for a ""hot day"" on Mars. There are places where it can get as high as 20C for  short periods. In this scenario, the mud boiled vigorously in the low pressure; ""it was jumping over the surface as if levitating,"" said Dr Brož.The team's work should be a reminder to scientists that when they look at planetary bodies, physical processes can sometimes produce unexpected outcomes, he added.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",18 May 2020,science
Pollution: Birds 'ingesting hundreds of bits of plastic a day',"Birds living on river banks are ingesting plastic at the rate of hundreds of tiny fragments a day, according to a new study.Scientists say this is the first clear evidence that plastic pollutants in rivers are finding their way into wildlife and moving up the food chain.Pieces of plastic 5mm or smaller (microplastics), including polyester, polypropylene and nylon, are known to pollute rivers. The impacts on wildlife are unclear. Researchers at Cardiff University looked at plastic pollutants found in a bird known as a dipper, which wades or dives into rivers in search of underwater insects.""These iconic birds, the dippers, are ingesting hundreds of pieces of plastic every day,"" said Prof Steve Ormerod of Cardiff University's Water Research Institute. ""They're also feeding this material to their chicks.""Previous research has shown that half of the insects in the rivers of south Wales contain microplastic fragments.""The fact that so many river insects are contaminated makes it inevitable that fish, birds and other predators will pick up these polluted prey - but this is the first time that this type of transfer through food webs has been shown clearly in free-living river animals,"" said co-researcher Dr Joseph D'Souza.The research team examined droppings and regurgitated pellets from dippers living near rivers running from the Brecon Beacons down to the Severn Estuary.They found microplastic fragments in roughly half of 166 samples taken from adults and nestlings, at 14 of 15 sites studied, with the greatest concentrations in urban locations. Most were fibres from textiles or building materials.Calculations suggest dippers are ingesting around 200 tiny fragments of plastic a day from the insects they consume.Previous studies have shown that microplastics are present even in the depths of the ocean and are ending up in the bodies of living organisms, from seals to crabs to seabirds.Rivers are a major route between land and sea for microplastics such as synthetic clothing fibres, tyre dust and other fragmenting plastic waste. The research, published in the journal Global Change Biology, was carried out in collaboration with the Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter.Follow Helen on Twitter.",22 May 2020,science
Covid recovery could 'tip the balance' for nature,"Environmental scientists have called for the conservation of nature to be at the centre of the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.With countries still ensnared by the crisis, scientists have urged governments to make plans that ""safeguard biodiversity and human health"" as they rebuild. The researchers published an open letter in the journal Science.""How we emerge from lockdowns,"" they say, ""will drive a new world economy."" This is likely to have lasting effects on global biodiversity, the Australian authors argue.The right long-term plans, from governments and international organisations, could ""tip the balance"" in favour of nature. There are some striking examples of upheavals that have had unintended benefits for nature. The catastrophic nuclear accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine, and the resulting exclusion zone around the plant, created an unplanned wilderness that has since been designated an ecological reserve. ""The Colombia Conflict, for example, created unofficial protected areas,"" explained Dr Ryan Pearson from Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. ""This slowed environmental degradation because people were fearful of entering remote areas occupied by rebels.""The more recent ""post-conflict"" increase in deforestation there shows the need for longer-term strategies that can maintain the positive side effects of crises.""There have been many reports of wild animals increasing in numbers and turning up in places they haven't been seen i a long time,"" Dr Pearson told BBC News. "" This carries implications that certain species may be benefiting from the absence of human influence during lockdowns or possibly because of reduced pollution, especially in waterways.""We can't be sure how long such effects will last unless long-term strategies are implemented to encourage them.""There is, the scientists say, a concern that the rush to re-stabilise and grow economies may come ""at the expense of the environment"".This group of environmental scientists are adding their voices to a call for a greener focus as the world rebuilds. Dr Pearson added: ""We hope our letter will encourage positive strategies to support biodiversity into legislation, and the behaviour of people in their choices - in their consumption, investment, and travel.""Follow Victoria on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
Nature: Bumblebees' 'clever trick' fools plants into flowering,"Scientists have discovered a new behaviour among bumblebees that tricks plants into flowering early. Researchers found that when deprived of pollen, bumblebees will nibble on the leaves of flowerless plants. The damage done seems to fool the plant into flowering, sometimes up to 30 days earlier than normal. Writing in the journal Science, the scientists say they have struggled to replicate the bees' trick in the laboratory.With their fuzzy appearance and distinctive drone, bumblebees are hard to miss in gardens all over the world. Their dense, hairy bodies make them excellent pollinators for crops like tomatoes and blueberries.They are among the first bees to emerge each year and work a long season. Some colonies remain active through the winter in southern and urban areas of the UK.But despite their key role, bumblebees, like many other pollinators have seen their numbers tumble in recent decades.One recent study pointed to climate change, reporting that an increasing number of hot days in Europe and North America was boosting local extinction rates. But researchers have now made a discovery about bumblebees that could have relevance to their long-term survival.Scientists in Switzerland found that when the bees were deprived of pollen, they started to nibble on the leaves of plants that hadn't yet flowered.The bees used their proboscises and mandibles (mouthparts) to cut distinctively-shaped holes in the leaves.But the creatures didn't eat the material or use it in their nests.The damaged plants responded by blooming earlier than normal - in some cases up to 30 days ahead of schedule.""I think everything that we've found is consistent with the idea that the bees are damaging the plants and that that's an adaptation that brings flowers online earlier and that benefits the bees,"" said Dr Mark Mescher, one of the authors from ETH Zurich, told BBC News.When the researchers tried to emulate the damage done to the plants by the bumblebees they weren't able to achieve the same results. The bee-damaged plants flowered 30 days earlier than undamaged plants and 25 days earlier than ones damaged by the scientists. The research team believes there may be something else going on here apart from nibbles.""We really tried to replicate with the best of our ability,"" said Prof Consuelo De Moraes, also from ETH Zurich.""It's possible that the bees also have some cue that they are providing to the plants that is specific to the bee.""""And that could be secretions that we don't know about but it's something that we plan to investigate.""The researchers say the damage has a particular pattern that the scientists have learned to recognise, even in the most unlikely places. ""You see these semi-circular sort of incisions, often in the leaf,"" said Dr Mescher. ""One of the students was saying that they were eating a salad the other day, and they saw that kind of damage on the leaf that was probably from a bumblebee.""The researchers say that when pollen is available the bees don't damage plants. They've also found this behaviour is in wild bees.However the team are keeping an open mind on whether the plants might be the ones in the driving seat. It is vital for plants that depend on pollination to have their flowers on display when the pollinators are buzzing around. It could be that some plants have evolved a strategy to push out their flowers when they recognise the bee doing damage to their leaves. Ultimately, though, knowing more about the relationship between bumblebees and flowering might have implications for the resilience of these creatures in the face of a changing environment.""I think it's fascinating how much we still don't know about organisms that we think we know really well,"" said Prof De Moraes.""It absolutely increases our sense of wonder at the cleverness of nature in all its many forms.""Follow Matt on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
