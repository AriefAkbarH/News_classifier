Wildlife scientists examine the great 'human pause',"A UK-led team has launched an initiative to track wildlife before, during and after lockdown. The researchers' aim is to study what they have called the ""anthropause"" - the global-scale, temporary slowdown in human activity, which is likely to have a profound impact on other species. Measuring that impact, they say, will reveal ways in which we can ""share our increasingly crowded planet"".They outline this mission in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports. They outline ""urgent steps"" to allow scientists to learn as much as possible from the sudden absence of humans in many landscapes - including ensuring that researchers have access and permission to carry out their work, and can gain access to information about human movement, as well as animal-tracking data. Prof Christian Rutz from the University of St Andrews is president of the International Bio-logging Society. He pointed out that bio-loggers - small tracking devices fitted to animals in order to record their movements and other behaviour - have been collecting information in habitats all over the world throughout the pandemic. ""There is a really valuable research opportunity here, one that's been brought about by the most tragic circumstances, but it's one we think we can't afford to miss,"" he told BBC News.  Usually, studies which try to examine the impact of human presence and activity on wild animals are limited to comparing protected habitats to unprotected areas, or studying landscapes in the wake of a natural disaster. ""But during lockdown we have this replicated around the globe -  in different localities and for habitats where some species have been fitted with tracking devices the whole time,"" said Prof Rutz.There have been many accounts on social media of wildlife apparently making the most of our absence  - moving freely through surprisingly urban settings. In some places though, the lack of human activity appears to have been detrimental - increases in poaching driven by poverty, and the absence of ecotourism. ""No one's saying that humans should stay in lockdown permanently,"" added Prof Rutz. ""But what if we see major impacts of our changes in road use, for example? We could use that to make small changes to our transport network that could have major benefits.""Prof Jim Smith from the University of Portsmouth has been part of what might be considered the first anthropause study - a long-term investigation into the changes in the abandoned landscape around the damaged Chernobyl nuclear power plant.""Just a few years after the evacuation of the Exclusion Zone, Belarussian and Ukrainian researchers found species associated with humans - like pigeons and rats - were disappearing, but wild animals - wild boar, deer and wolf - were multiplying,"" he said.  ""Still abandoned more than 30 years later, the zone has become an iconic example of accidental rewilding.""""At great economic and human cost, Covid and Chernobyl forced us to push the pause button on our environmental damage,"" Prof Smith continued.  ""Stopping some of those impacts altogether will be hard, but will be helped by what we can learn from these extreme events.""Prof Rutz and his team pointed out in their paper: ""Scientific knowledge gained during this devastating crisis will allow us to develop innovative strategies for sharing space on this increasingly crowded planet, with benefits for both wildlife and humans.""Follow Victoria on Twitter",23 June 2020,science

Climate change: Planting new forests 'can do more harm than good',"Rather than benefiting the environment, large-scale tree planting may do the opposite, two new studies have found.One paper says that financial incentives to plant trees can backfire and reduce biodiversity with little impact on carbon emissions. A separate project found that the amount of carbon that new forests can absorb may be overestimated. The key message from both papers is that planting trees is not a simple climate solution. Over the past few years, the idea of planting trees as a low cost, high impact solution to climate change has really taken hold. Previous studies have indicated that trees have enormous potential to soak up and store carbon, and many countries have established tree planting campaigns as a key element of their plans to tackle climate change. In the UK, promises by the political parties to plant ever larger numbers of trees were a feature of last year's general election.In the US, even President Donald Trump has rowed in behind the Trillion Trees Campaign.Legislation to support the idea has been introduced into the US Congress.Another major tree planting initiative is called the Bonn Challenge.Countries are being urged to restore 350 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2030.So far, around 40 nations have endorsed the idea.But scientists have urged caution against the headlong rush to plant new forests. They point to the fact that in the Bonn Challenge nearly 80% of the commitments made to date involve planting monoculture plantations or a limited mix of trees that produce specific products such as fruit or rubber. The authors of this new study have looked closely at the financial incentives given to private landowners to plant trees. These payments are seen as a key element of increasing the number of trees significantly. The study looked at the example of Chile, where a decree subsidising tree planting ran from 1974 to 2012, and was widely seen as a globally influential afforestation policy.The law subsidised 75% of the costs of planting new forests. While it was intended not to apply to existing forests, lax enforcement and budgetary limitations meant that some landowners simply replaced native forests with more profitable new tree plantations. Their study found the subsidy scheme expanded the area covered by trees, but decreased the area of native forest. The authors point out that since Chile's native forests are rich in biodiversity and store large amounts of carbon, the subsidy scheme failed to increase the carbon stores and accelerated biodiversity loss.""If policies to incentivise tree plantations are poorly designed or poorly enforced, there is a high risk of not only wasting public money but also releasing more carbon and losing biodiversity,"" said co-author Prof Eric Lambin, from Stanford University. ""That's the exact opposite of what these policies are aiming for.""A second study set out to examine how much carbon a newly planted forest would be able to absorb from the atmosphere.Up until now, many scientists have calculated the amount of carbon that trees can pull down from the air using a fixed ratio.Suspecting that this ratio would depend on local conditions, the researchers looked at northern China, which has seen intensive tree planting by the government because of climate change but also in an effort to reduce dust from the Gobi desert. Looking at 11,000 soil samples taken from afforested plots, the scientists found that in carbon poor soils, adding new trees did increase the density of organic carbon. But where soils were already rich in carbon, adding new trees decreased this density. The authors say that previous assumptions about how much organic carbon can be fixed by planting new trees is likely an overestimate. ""We hope that people can understand that afforestation practices are not one single thing,"" said Dr Anping Chen, from Colorado State University and a lead author on the study. ""Afforestation involves many technical details and balances of different parts, and it cannot solve all our climate problems.""Both papers have been published in the journal Nature Sustainability.Follow Matt on Twitter.",22 June 2020,science
Arctic Circle sees 'highest-ever' recorded temperatures,"Temperatures in the Arctic Circle are likely to have hit an all-time record on Saturday, reaching a scorching 38C (100F) in Verkhoyansk, a Siberian town.The record still needs to be verified, but it appears to have been 18C higher than the average maximum daily temperature in June.Hot summer weather is not uncommon in the Arctic Circle, but recent months have seen abnormally high temperatures.The Arctic is believed to be warming twice as fast as the global average.Verkhoyansk, home to about 1,300 people, sits just inside the Arctic Circle, in remote Siberia. It has an extreme climate with temperatures plunging in January to an average maximum of -42C and then surging in June to 20C.But a persistent heatwave this year in the Arctic Circle has worried meteorologists. In March, April and May, the Copernicus Climate Change service reported that the average temperature was around 10C above normal. Earlier in June, parts of Siberia recorded 30C, while in May, Khatanga in Russia - situated in the Arctic Circle at 72 degrees north - set a new May temperature record of 25.4C.""Year-on-year temperature records are being broken around the world, but the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth,"" said Dr Dann Mitchell, associate professor in atmospheric science at the University of Bristol. ""So it is unsurprising to see records being broken in this region. We will see more of this in the near future.""   Analysis by Simon King, BBC Weather meteorologistHeatwaves in the Arctic aren't unusual. Weather patterns around the world can align in such a way that hot air is transported quite far northward and colder air from the poles southward. Over the last few months a large area of high pressure in eastern Russia has been dominant. This has led to southerly winds bringing warmer air from near the tropics, leading to higher than average temperatures. However, the persistence of this weather pattern has led to a longevity and scale of heat that is worrying. This is consistent with what climatologists believe will happen in the Arctic with climate change.Most scientists agree that over the past 30 years, the Arctic has warmed at a rate of twice the global average. The graphic below shows that across the globe, through the period 1960-2019, average air temperature has generally increased by around 1C.  However, as you head closer to the North Pole - latitude 90° - the reds become darker. This shows how the temperature has increased here more than anywhere else - by around 4C.Warming in the Arctic is leading to the thawing of once permanently frozen permafrost below ground.This is alarming scientists because as permafrost thaws, carbon dioxide and methane previously locked up below ground is released.These greenhouse gases can cause further warming, and further thawing of the permafrost, in a vicious cycle known as positive feedback.The higher temperatures also cause land ice in the Arctic to melt at a faster rate, leading to greater run-off into the ocean where it contributes to sea-level rise.There is also an element of positive feedback here, says BBC Weather, because the loss of highly reflective white ice means that the ground and sea absorb more heat. This leads to more warming.The impact of wildfires are also a consideration. Last summer, they ravaged parts of the Arctic. Although they are common in summer, high temperatures and strong winds made them unusually severe.They typically start in early May before peaking in July and August but by late April this year they were already ten times bigger in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia compared to the same time last year, Russia's emergencies minister said.Well, 2020 is certainly shaping up to be a contender.  The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, reckons there's a 50:50 chance it'll be the hottest year ever recorded. Much of northern Europe and Asia has had an exceptionally mild spring and early summer with temperatures 10C higher than normal in some areas. The hottest year to date is 2016. It is still a nose ahead, but the margins are ""very close"".Of course, this should come as no surprise.""We've upset the energy balance of the entire planet,"" cautions Prof Chris Rapley of University College London. Year after year we see temperature records being broken, the eminent climate scientist says.""This is a warning message from the Earth itself,"" he tells me.

One-fifth of Earth's ocean floor is now mapped,"We've just become a little less ignorant about Planet Earth.The initiative that seeks to galvanise the creation of a full map of the ocean floor says one-fifth of this task has now been completed.When the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project was launched in 2017, only 6% of the global ocean bottom had been surveyed to what might be called modern standards.That number now stands at 19%, up from 15% in just the last year.Some 14.5 million sq km of new bathymetric (depth) data was included in the GEBCO grid in 2019 - an area equivalent to almost twice that of Australia.It does, however, still leave a great swathe of the planet in need of mapping to an acceptable degree.""Today we stand at the 19% level. That means we've got another 81% of the oceans still to survey, still to map. That's an area about twice the size of Mars that we have to capture in the next decade,"" project director Jamie McMichael-Phillips told BBC News.The map at the top of this page illustrates the challenge faced by GEBCO in the coming years. Black represents those areas where we have yet to get direct echosounding measurements of the shape of the ocean floor. Blues correspond to water depth (deeper is purple, shallower is lighter blue). It's not true to say we have no idea of what's in the black zones; satellites have actually taught us a great deal. Certain spacecraft carry altimeter instruments that can infer seafloor topography from the way its gravity sculpts the water surface above - but this only gives a best resolution at over a kilometre, and Seabed 2030 has a desire for a resolution of at least 100m everywhere.Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons.They are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines.They are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water.This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a critical role in moving heat around the planet. And if you want to understand precisely how sea-levels will rise in different parts  of the world, good ocean-floor maps are a must.Much of the data that's been imported into the GEBCO grid recently has been in existence for some time but was ""sitting on a shelf"" out of the public domain. The companies, institutions and governments that were holding this information have now handed it over - and there is probably a lot more of this hidden resource still to be released.But new acquisitions will also be required. Some of these will come from a great crowdsourcing effort - from ships, big and small, routinely operating their echo-sounding equipment as they transit the globe. Even small vessels - fishing boats and yachts - can play their part by attaching data-loggers to their sonar and navigation equipment. One very effective strategy is evidenced by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which operates in the more remote parts of the globe - and that is simply to mix up the routes taken by ships.""Very early on we adopted the ethos that data should be collected on passage - on the way to where we were going, not just at the site of interest,"" explained BAS scientist Dr Rob Larter. ""A beautiful example of this is the recent bathymetric map of the Drake Passage area (between South America and Antarctica). A lot of that was acquired by different research projects as they fanned out and moved back and forth to the places they were going.""New technology will be absolutely central to the GEBCO quest. Ocean Infinity, a prominent UK-US company that conducts seafloor surveys, is currently building a fleet of robotic surface vessels through a subsidiary it calls Armada. This start-up's MD, Dan Hook, says low-cost, uncrewed vehicles may be the only way to close some of the gaps in the more out-of-the-way locations in the 2030 grid.He told BBC News: ""When you look at the the mapping of the seabed in areas closer to shore, you see the business case very quickly. Whether it's for wind farms or cable-laying - there are lots of people that want to know what's down there. But when it's those very remote areas of the planet, the case then is really only a scientific one.""    Jamie McMichael-Phillips is confident his project's target can be met if everyone pulls together.""I am confident, but to do it we will need partnerships. We need governments, we need industry, we need academics, we need philanthropists, and we need citizen scientists. We need all these individuals to come together if we're to deliver an ocean map that is absolutely fundamental and essential to humankind.""GEBCO stands for General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans.

Climate change: Planting new forests 'can do more harm than good',"Rather than benefiting the environment, large-scale tree planting may do the opposite, two new studies have found.One paper says that financial incentives to plant trees can backfire and reduce biodiversity with little impact on carbon emissions. A separate project found that the amount of carbon that new forests can absorb may be overestimated. The key message from both papers is that planting trees is not a simple climate solution. Over the past few years, the idea of planting trees as a low cost, high impact solution to climate change has really taken hold. Previous studies have indicated that trees have enormous potential to soak up and store carbon, and many countries have established tree planting campaigns as a key element of their plans to tackle climate change. In the UK, promises by the political parties to plant ever larger numbers of trees were a feature of last year's general election.In the US, even President Donald Trump has rowed in behind the Trillion Trees Campaign.Legislation to support the idea has been introduced into the US Congress.Another major tree planting initiative is called the Bonn Challenge.Countries are being urged to restore 350 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2030.So far, around 40 nations have endorsed the idea.But scientists have urged caution against the headlong rush to plant new forests. They point to the fact that in the Bonn Challenge nearly 80% of the commitments made to date involve planting monoculture plantations or a limited mix of trees that produce specific products such as fruit or rubber. The authors of this new study have looked closely at the financial incentives given to private landowners to plant trees. These payments are seen as a key element of increasing the number of trees significantly. The study looked at the example of Chile, where a decree subsidising tree planting ran from 1974 to 2012, and was widely seen as a globally influential afforestation policy.The law subsidised 75% of the costs of planting new forests. While it was intended not to apply to existing forests, lax enforcement and budgetary limitations meant that some landowners simply replaced native forests with more profitable new tree plantations. Their study found the subsidy scheme expanded the area covered by trees, but decreased the area of native forest. The authors point out that since Chile's native forests are rich in biodiversity and store large amounts of carbon, the subsidy scheme failed to increase the carbon stores and accelerated biodiversity loss.""If policies to incentivise tree plantations are poorly designed or poorly enforced, there is a high risk of not only wasting public money but also releasing more carbon and losing biodiversity,"" said co-author Prof Eric Lambin, from Stanford University. ""That's the exact opposite of what these policies are aiming for.""A second study set out to examine how much carbon a newly planted forest would be able to absorb from the atmosphere.Up until now, many scientists have calculated the amount of carbon that trees can pull down from the air using a fixed ratio.Suspecting that this ratio would depend on local conditions, the researchers looked at northern China, which has seen intensive tree planting by the government because of climate change but also in an effort to reduce dust from the Gobi desert. Looking at 11,000 soil samples taken from afforested plots, the scientists found that in carbon poor soils, adding new trees did increase the density of organic carbon. But where soils were already rich in carbon, adding new trees decreased this density. The authors say that previous assumptions about how much organic carbon can be fixed by planting new trees is likely an overestimate. ""We hope that people can understand that afforestation practices are not one single thing,"" said Dr Anping Chen, from Colorado State University and a lead author on the study. ""Afforestation involves many technical details and balances of different parts, and it cannot solve all our climate problems.""Both papers have been published in the journal Nature Sustainability.Follow Matt on Twitter.",22 June 2020,science
Arctic Circle sees 'highest-ever' recorded temperatures,"Temperatures in the Arctic Circle are likely to have hit an all-time record on Saturday, reaching a scorching 38C (100F) in Verkhoyansk, a Siberian town.The record still needs to be verified, but it appears to have been 18C higher than the average maximum daily temperature in June.Hot summer weather is not uncommon in the Arctic Circle, but recent months have seen abnormally high temperatures.The Arctic is believed to be warming twice as fast as the global average.Verkhoyansk, home to about 1,300 people, sits just inside the Arctic Circle, in remote Siberia. It has an extreme climate with temperatures plunging in January to an average maximum of -42C and then surging in June to 20C.But a persistent heatwave this year in the Arctic Circle has worried meteorologists. In March, April and May, the Copernicus Climate Change service reported that the average temperature was around 10C above normal. Earlier in June, parts of Siberia recorded 30C, while in May, Khatanga in Russia - situated in the Arctic Circle at 72 degrees north - set a new May temperature record of 25.4C.""Year-on-year temperature records are being broken around the world, but the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth,"" said Dr Dann Mitchell, associate professor in atmospheric science at the University of Bristol. ""So it is unsurprising to see records being broken in this region. We will see more of this in the near future.""   Analysis by Simon King, BBC Weather meteorologistHeatwaves in the Arctic aren't unusual. Weather patterns around the world can align in such a way that hot air is transported quite far northward and colder air from the poles southward. Over the last few months a large area of high pressure in eastern Russia has been dominant. This has led to southerly winds bringing warmer air from near the tropics, leading to higher than average temperatures. However, the persistence of this weather pattern has led to a longevity and scale of heat that is worrying. This is consistent with what climatologists believe will happen in the Arctic with climate change.Most scientists agree that over the past 30 years, the Arctic has warmed at a rate of twice the global average. The graphic below shows that across the globe, through the period 1960-2019, average air temperature has generally increased by around 1C.  However, as you head closer to the North Pole - latitude 90° - the reds become darker. This shows how the temperature has increased here more than anywhere else - by around 4C.Warming in the Arctic is leading to the thawing of once permanently frozen permafrost below ground.This is alarming scientists because as permafrost thaws, carbon dioxide and methane previously locked up below ground is released.These greenhouse gases can cause further warming, and further thawing of the permafrost, in a vicious cycle known as positive feedback.The higher temperatures also cause land ice in the Arctic to melt at a faster rate, leading to greater run-off into the ocean where it contributes to sea-level rise.There is also an element of positive feedback here, says BBC Weather, because the loss of highly reflective white ice means that the ground and sea absorb more heat. This leads to more warming.The impact of wildfires are also a consideration. Last summer, they ravaged parts of the Arctic. Although they are common in summer, high temperatures and strong winds made them unusually severe.They typically start in early May before peaking in July and August but by late April this year they were already ten times bigger in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia compared to the same time last year, Russia's emergencies minister said.Well, 2020 is certainly shaping up to be a contender.  The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, reckons there's a 50:50 chance it'll be the hottest year ever recorded. Much of northern Europe and Asia has had an exceptionally mild spring and early summer with temperatures 10C higher than normal in some areas. The hottest year to date is 2016. It is still a nose ahead, but the margins are ""very close"".Of course, this should come as no surprise.""We've upset the energy balance of the entire planet,"" cautions Prof Chris Rapley of University College London. Year after year we see temperature records being broken, the eminent climate scientist says.""This is a warning message from the Earth itself,"" he tells me. ""We ignore it at our peril.""",22 June 2020,science
One-fifth of Earth's ocean floor is now mapped,"We've just become a little less ignorant about Planet Earth.The initiative that seeks to galvanise the creation of a full map of the ocean floor says one-fifth of this task has now been completed.When the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project was launched in 2017, only 6% of the global ocean bottom had been surveyed to what might be called modern standards.That number now stands at 19%, up from 15% in just the last year.Some 14.5 million sq km of new bathymetric (depth) data was included in the GEBCO grid in 2019 - an area equivalent to almost twice that of Australia.It does, however, still leave a great swathe of the planet in need of mapping to an acceptable degree.""Today we stand at the 19% level. That means we've got another 81% of the oceans still to survey, still to map. That's an area about twice the size of Mars that we have to capture in the next decade,"" project director Jamie McMichael-Phillips told BBC News.The map at the top of this page illustrates the challenge faced by GEBCO in the coming years. Black represents those areas where we have yet to get direct echosounding measurements of the shape of the ocean floor. Blues correspond to water depth (deeper is purple, shallower is lighter blue). It's not true to say we have no idea of what's in the black zones; satellites have actually taught us a great deal. Certain spacecraft carry altimeter instruments that can infer seafloor topography from the way its gravity sculpts the water surface above - but this only gives a best resolution at over a kilometre, and Seabed 2030 has a desire for a resolution of at least 100m everywhere.Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons.They are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines.They are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water.This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a critical role in moving heat around the planet. And if you want to understand precisely how sea-levels will rise in different parts  of the world, good ocean-floor maps are a must.Much of the data that's been imported into the GEBCO grid recently has been in existence for some time but was ""sitting on a shelf"" out of the public domain. The companies, institutions and governments that were holding this information have now handed it over - and there is probably a lot more of this hidden resource still to be released.But new acquisitions will also be required. Some of these will come from a great crowdsourcing effort - from ships, big and small, routinely operating their echo-sounding equipment as they transit the globe. Even small vessels - fishing boats and yachts - can play their part by attaching data-loggers to their sonar and navigation equipment. One very effective strategy is evidenced by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which operates in the more remote parts of the globe - and that is simply to mix up the routes taken by ships.""Very early on we adopted the ethos that data should be collected on passage - on the way to where we were going, not just at the site of interest,"" explained BAS scientist Dr Rob Larter. ""A beautiful example of this is the recent bathymetric map of the Drake Passage area (between South America and Antarctica). A lot of that was acquired by different research projects as they fanned out and moved back and forth to the places they were going.""New technology will be absolutely central to the GEBCO quest. Ocean Infinity, a prominent UK-US company that conducts seafloor surveys, is currently building a fleet of robotic surface vessels through a subsidiary it calls Armada. This start-up's MD, Dan Hook, says low-cost, uncrewed vehicles may be the only way to close some of the gaps in the more out-of-the-way locations in the 2030 grid.He told BBC News: ""When you look at the the mapping of the seabed in areas closer to shore, you see the business case very quickly. Whether it's for wind farms or cable-laying - there are lots of people that want to know what's down there. But when it's those very remote areas of the planet, the case then is really only a scientific one.""

Climate change: Sport heading for a fall as temperatures rise,"Global sport faces major disruption from climate change in coming decades, according to a new analysis.By 2050, it's estimated that almost one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year. But tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says. The study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously.While the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot.Extreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years. A typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there. Smoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year. These and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new study compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt.As football slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050.In the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat.Cricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies.Venues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade. In golf, one in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says. Winter sports also face an uncertain future. Researchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050.But as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions. The author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country like Bolivia at the low end but as large as a country like Spain on the high end.The estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate.Whatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author. ""Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,"" said David Goldblatt.""Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,"" he said.While some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050, the majority of sports authorities have not. The International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up. Among winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, ""which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,"" the report waspishly notes. The report was commissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance, a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change. ""A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,"" said Andrew Simms from the group.""If players also speak out and say they believe clean air and a stable climate matter, millions more will see the possibilities for change.  It will not only send a message of hope for the wider world, but it will help to guarantee a planet that is safe for sport.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.",20 June 2020,science
Urban dwellers yearn for 'Good Life' allotments,"Land set aside for allotments in the UK has declined by 65% from a peak in the ""dig for victory"" and post-war era.Scientists estimated that the lost allotments could have provided 6% of the population with their ""five-a-day"" fruit and veg diet.The most deprived areas suffered the worst decline, experiencing eight times the level of allotment closures compared with the most affluent areas.The study's findings appear in the Landscape and Urban Planning journal.""We found that, overall, there had been a 65% decline in the total area of allotment land from its peak (1950s) to 2016,"" explained co-author Miriam Dobson from the University of Sheffield. ""In terms of the amount of the amount of food production capacity lost, the closed allotment land could have fed 6% of the population on their 'five-a-day' diet.""The researchers decided to assess the volume of land set aside for allotments because although it was widely assumed  that there had been a decline since the peak during the ""dig for victory"" and post-war years, there was no data available. The team also wanted to understand if any of the former allotments could be reinstated as allotments to meet the renewed demand for allotments. They said that the waiting list for an allotment plot was an estimated 100,000 people in 2013.To gather the data it needed, the study looked at 10 geographically distributed cities across the UK, using historical Ordnance Survey maps of the 20th Century. It was then possible to plot the land used as allotments and monitor land-use change over the decades.Ms Dobson, a PhD student at the university's Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, said there were a number of factors behind the reduction of allotment plots.""There was reduced demand after the 1950s as people relied more on supermarkets and convenience stores,"" she told BBC News. ""There was also a loss in leisure time, which meant people did not have the time to attend to their allotment plots, and a loss of food growing knowledge created barriers to entry.""As well as this, as the urban population was growing, urban land became increasingly valuable to developers.""Yet regarding the allotment sites that had been closed, the team found that about a quarter of the land had not been developed for buildings but had been used as another form of green space.  ""If the land within this was potentially suitable for reconversion to allotments was changed back to food production, the space available could meet up to 100% of the waiting list demand in the cities,"" observed Ms Dobson. In recent years, the demand for allotment plots has seen a renaissance, which many younger people wanted to grow their own fruit and veg, rather than it being seen as the preserve of pensioners.During the Covid-19 lockdown, people with allotments have been spending a lot of their time on their plots, growing plenty of fresh fruit and veg - which, at times, have been challenging to source in supermarkets.Ms Dobson observed: ""We have already seen a huge increase in the number of people interested in growing their own food as a result of coronavirus, with garden centres and online shops selling out of seeds in the first weeks of lockdown.""Coronavirus has… highlighted to people the fragility inherent within our globalised food system. In a time of crisis, interest in self-sufficiency rises.She added that she felt there would likely be a surge in demand for allotment following this pandemic.The team felt their study showed the importance of making sure that urban food production, such as allotments, were protected from being shut down, as well as highlighting the potential to expand such sites in towns and cities to meet demand.",19 June 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: What is the Crew Dragon?,"The Crew Dragon  launched astronauts from US soil for the first time since the last Shuttle flight in 2011. But it's a very different type of vehicle to Nasa's retired spaceplane.Elon Musk says human spaceflight had always been the fundamental goal for his pioneering company SpaceX.The entrepreneur achieved that ambition on Saturday 30 May 2020, when the Crew Dragon spacecraft carried Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS).But the company had to walk before it could run. Crew Dragon evolved from an earlier design, called Dragon 1, which launched 20 times on missions to deliver cargo to the ISS between May 2012 and March 2020.In May 2014, Musk unveiled the seven-seat Crew Dragon concept during an event at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Like Dragon 1, the crewed version is a capsule design, making it more similar to the Apollo command modules that carried astronauts to the Moon than the winged space shuttle concept, which was conceived to carry both a crew and a large payload.From launch up until shortly before re-entry, the capsule is attached to a section called the trunk which has solar panels, heat-removal radiators and fins to provide stability during emergency aborts. Together, the capsule and trunk stand around 8.1m (26.7ft) tall, with a diameter of 4m (13ft).The Crew Dragon is equipped with 16 Draco thrusters that are used to manoeuvre the vehicle in orbit. Each Draco is capable of producing 90 pounds of force in the vacuum of space.SpaceX engineer John Federspiel, explains: ""When we wanted to take Dragon and make it human-rated, I think we took a different approach to spaceship design than has previously been done, because we wanted this to feel like a 21st Century spaceship.""Probably one of the biggest features of Dragon are the touchscreens on the inside. We designed them not just to be very functional, but with a user experience in mind.""The three large displays that allow Hurley and Behnken to monitor systems and control the spacecraft are a world away from the analogue buttons, dials and control stick that featured in the cockpit of the shuttle, which flew from 1981 to 2011.The two Nasa astronauts have been working with SpaceX to get the vehicle ready for its first crewed flight. Hurley admits that the ""glass cockpit"" took a bit of getting used to. ""As far as actual physical feedback, you certainly don't get that from the touchscreen,"" he says.""But what you do get is an indication of where you touched and that's part of the process of flying the vehicle manually is... I touched that button and that made the vehicle go up and I got the return flash that that's what the vehicle recognised as my input.""For the types of scenarios where astronauts might need to assume manual control of the normally autonomous craft, such as finishing off a docking sequence with the space station, the touchscreen controls are ""much more than adequate"", Hurley adds.""It just might not be the same thing you'd want to use if you were suited up and trying to fly an entry or descent, for example, like we could do with the space shuttle,"" says Behnken.But tailoring the spacecraft to the user experience involved more than just the design of the controls. ""When I think of comfort for the astronauts, it's really every aspect of how you could interact with the spaceship that comes to mind,"" says John Federspiel.""We have three different seat sizes, we even go so far as moulding the foam around the astronaut's body so there's not any pressure points and it's just generally a pleasurable journey into space.""When the astronaut gets ready to strap in, they plug an ""umbilical"" line from their seat into a port on the right thigh of their space suit. The umbilical provides the suit with life support systems, including air and power connections.""The suit is really one part of the bigger Dragon system... we think of it as a suit-seat system,"" says Chris Trigg, space suits and crew equipment manager at SpaceX.But in case anything goes wrong on the pad or during the climb to orbit, SpaceX has designed an innovative abort system for the capsule. The launch escape system (LES) consists of a set of SpaceX-designed SuperDraco engines that fire in the event of an emergency to propel the capsule and its crew safely away from the rocket.Commenting on the LES, Doug Hurley says: ""That perspective for me is huge compared to shuttle, where there were what we call 'black zones'... scenarios where it didn't really matter if you had the right combination of failures, you were likely not going to survive.""Hurley adds that the capsule design is safer than a winged vehicle under most circumstances.Crew Dragon is also designed to be ""two-fault tolerant"". This means that any two things can fail, such as a flight computer and a thruster, and the spacecraft can still bring the crew home safely.The vehicle is designed to dock with the space station autonomously - that is, without having to be guided in by a human. Jessica Jensen, director of Starship mission hardware and operation at SpaceX, says: ""We have GPS sensors on Dragon, but also cameras and imaging sensors such as Lidar on the nosecone as it's approaching the space station.""All these sensors are feeding data back to our flight computer to say: 'Hey, how far away am I from the space station? What's my relative velocity to the space station?'""The flight computer then uses algorithms that determine - based on this information - how to fire the thrusters to most effectively get to the docking target.When it returns to Earth, the Crew Dragon can't simply land on a runway like the space shuttle. ""I think there's an argument that the return is more dangerous in some ways than the ascent,"" says Elon Musk.During re-entry, the heat shield must survive temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sun, as the Crew Dragon screams through the atmosphere at up to 25 times the speed of sound.There's a minor chance that the spacecraft's asymmetric design - driven by the placement of its emergency escape system - could cause it to roll too much. Musk has said in the past that the issue, known as roll instability, has been extensively studied, but that it still worries him.Then, after the fiery re-entry phase, the spacecraft needs to deploy four parachutes to slow its descent. Finally, the Crew Dragon splashes down in the Atlantic Ocean, 450km off the coast of Florida, where recovery ships will take the astronauts to safety and retrieve the capsule. Hurley says that while he and Behnken - along with others at Nasa - provided input, ""this spacecraft - Crew Dragon - is SpaceX's design, from start to finish. Make no mistake about that"".He adds: ""Just to see the vehicle come from not very much, a preliminary design, to where it is today, the operability of the vehicle, the clean lines, how it is inside the vehicle, how it is for a crew... we're just excited to put it through its paces.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",31 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Evolution of the spacesuit,"The spacesuits worn by astronauts for the Crew Dragon mission have been getting a lot of attention. How do they differ from other astronaut attire down the years?The futuristic flight suits worn by Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken during Saturday's successful launch look a world away from the bulky orange shuttle flight suits worn when astronauts last launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.The helmets are 3D-printed and the gloves are touchscreen-sensitive.But their primary purpose remains the same - to protect crew members from depressurisation, where air is lost from the capsule. The suits also ensure astronauts have sufficient oxygen and regulate their temperature. A communications link and breathable air are provided via a single ""umbilical"" cable in the seat that plugs in to the suit.The Starman suits, as they've been called, are all in one piece and customised for the astronaut. Their look was conceived by Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez, who has worked on Captain America: Civil War and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.But they are just designed for use inside the SpaceX capsule, known as the Crew Dragon, and are not suitable for use on spacewalks.Aerospace giant Boeing also has a contract with Nasa to carry astronauts to the space station in its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. It has developed a pressure suit to protect astronauts during the key phases of launch and re-entry.The Boeing Blue suits are about 40% lighter than earlier generations of spacesuits worn by American astronauts - and more flexible.They contain different internal layers to keep astronauts cool. The suit also has touchscreen-sensitive gloves - so astronauts can work with tablets in the spacecraft. The soft, hood-like helmet features a wide polycarbonate visor to give Starliner passengers better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space.Zips in the torso area will make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing.In October 2019, Nasa shared a close-up look at two next-generation suits for the agency's Artemis programme. Under this effort, Nasa will seek to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024, using the agency's Orion spacecraft.One of the suits is called the Orion Crew Survival System, and is comparable to the suits used by SpaceX and Boeing. It recalls the so-called Pumpkin suits used by space shuttle astronauts, but is more lightweight.The other suit, called the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) suit is designed to be worn on the surface of the Moon. It is much bulkier than the pressure suits designed to be worn inside spacecraft.This is because it needs to protect the wearer from temperature extremes outside the walls of the spacecraft. It is also designed to provide some shielding against micrometeorites and other small particles of space debris. In these respects, it is similar to suits previously used for spacewalking at the International Space Station (ISS).There are two suits used for spacewalking at the ISS. One is the Russian Orlan type, which was first used in December 1977.The Orlan is a one-piece spacesuit. The ""backpack"" opens like a fridge door, allowing the spacewalker to climb inside.Nasa's Extravehicular Mobility Suit (EMU) was introduced in 1981 and is the other suit used at the space station.Unlike the Orlan, the EMU comes in separate pieces, with a bottom and top half. The semi-rigid suit provides around 8.5 hours of life support for its wearer outside in the vacuum of space. Astronauts travelling to the ISS train with both suits.The suit worn by Apollo astronauts on the Moon was also called the EMU - though it's different from the modern design. It was the result of years of development.Spacesuits have come a long way since the first spacewalk by the late cosmonaut Alexei Leonov in March 1965.Leonov's suit inflated after he stepped out into the vacuum, so that his hands came out of his gloves. Only by bleeding air out of the suit, which put the cosmonaut at risk of the bends, was he able to get back inside the spacecraft..",28 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Who are the astronauts?,"Two US astronauts have achieved a world first by launching to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a spacecraft built by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Here, BBC News profiles the crew members.Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have broken a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011. In the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz.But officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program.Musk's vehicle was first to fly; Hurley and Behnken travelled to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft.""It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it,"" Hurley, 53, said at the beginning of May, before the flight.Behnken, 49, added: ""On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him.""Nasa chose two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends.""Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that,"" says Hurley.When they launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses knew exactly what they were going through. That's because they're astronauts too.Marine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel.Nyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas.""Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was,"" Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013.Air Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. As an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six.Hurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport.They ""can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be,"" Behnken told CNN before the launch. ""We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands.""Hurley says of Behnken: ""I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face."" But Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two.The older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. ""It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college,"" Hurley said in 2009.Behnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010, he described it as ""a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood"", adding: ""I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person.""He took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him. Both men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines.They both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven.""When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker',"" said Hurley. ""But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table.""Hurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms.Thus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay.When the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as the prime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard.""Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point,"" Hurley said this month.They've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels.Hurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX.""That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them,"" he explained.Setbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016. ""We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made,"" explained Hurley.Despite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remained undimmed: ""It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship.""Hurley told CNN: ""From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree.""But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",31 May 2020,science
Breathtaking new map of the X-ray Universe,"Behold the hot, energetic Universe.A German-Russian space telescope has just acquired a breakthrough map of the sky that traces the heavens in X-rays.The image records a lot of the violent action in the cosmos -  instances where matter is being accelerated, heated and shredded.Feasting black holes, exploding stars, and searingly hot gas.The data comes from the eRosita instrument mounted on Spektr-RG.This orbiting telescope was launched in July last year and despatched to an observing position some 1.5 million km from Earth. Once commissioned and declared fully operational in December, it was left to slowly rotate and scan the depths of space.eRosita's first all-sky data-set, represented in the image at the top of this page, was completed only last week. It records over a million sources of X-rays.""That's actually pretty much the same number as had been detected in the whole history of X-ray astronomy going back 60 years. We've basically doubled the known sources in just six months,"" said Kirpal Nandra, who heads the high-energy astrophysics group at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Garching, Germany.""The data is truly stunning and I think what we're doing here will revolutionise X-ray astronomy,"" he told BBC News.The map uses the so-called Aitoff projection, which unwraps the sphere of the sky on to an ellipse. The band across the middle is the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy, with the centre of the galaxy in the middle of the ellipse.The image has been encoded with colour to help describe what's going on. Blues represent higher energy X-rays (1-2.3 kiloelectron volts, keV); greens are mid-range (0.6-1 keV); and reds are lower energy (0.3-0.6 keV).Much of the galaxy's plane is dominated by highly energetic sources. In part, that's because copious amounts of gas and dust have absorbed and filtered out the lower energy radiation. Sources include stars with strong, magnetically active and extremely hot atmospheres.The greens and yellows that draw a kind of mushroom feature covering a great swathe of the map represent hot gas inside and just outside our galaxy. This material imprints information about the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.Some of the bigger splodges are well known actors on the sky. The bright yellow patch just above the plane on the far right is a concentration of supernova remnants - the wreckage of stars that have exploded and whose shockwaves have super-heated a surrounding cocoon of dust and gas. This particular patch is dominated by the Vela supernova remnant. This was an explosion that happened thousands of years ago but a mere 800 light-years from Earth.   Look next at the diffuse red glow at the top and bottom of the map. This is largely X-ray emission from hot gas well beyond our galaxy. And in the white speckles, we are seeing principally the signature of super-massive black holes. Indeed, about 80% of all the sources contained in the new map are the gargantuan black holes that reside at the centres of distant galaxies. They pump out X-rays as their immense gravitational pull draws in and eviscerates matter.Some of the super-massive black holes making an appearance in the map are seen when the Universe was younger than one billion years old, less than 10% of its present age.Spektr-RG and its eRosita instrument intend to gather seven more all-sky surveys over the next 3.5 years. This will enable the telescope to refine its data, to remove artefacts and noise, but also to sense deeper into the cosmos and pick up the faint sources that would otherwise be beyond detection.One key goal is to map the distribution of the hot, X-ray-emitting gas that illuminates the great clusters of galaxies.Astronomers hope this information can lead them to some fresh insights on how the Universe is structured and how it has changed through time. It's possible there may be some clues in this project about the nature of dark energy, the mysterious ""force"" that appears to be pushing the cosmos apart at an ever accelerating rate.""That's the big prize, but it would only come at the end of the mission,"" explained Prof Nandra. ""Eight surveys allows us to go really deep into the distant Universe. Basically, we're trying to detect all of the clusters of galaxies in the Universe above a certain mass limit. We've got a nice sample already - maybe around 10,000. But we're hoping to get at least 100,000 clusters of galaxies.""eRosita is the German element on Spektr-RG. It takes up most of the room on the spacecraft bus, or chassis. But it sits next to a Russian instrument known as ART-XC, which is sensitive to higher energies, up to 30 keV.Both eRosita and ART-XC use a cluster of seven tubular mirror modules to corral X-ray light down on to their sensitive camera detectors.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",19 June 2020,science
Dark matter hunt yields unexplained signal,"An experiment searching for signs of elusive dark matter has detected an unexplained signal.Scientists working on the Xenon1T experiment have detected more activity within their detector than they would otherwise expect.This ""excess of events"" could point to the existence of hypothesised particles called axions, some of which are candidates for dark matter.Dark matter comprises 85% of matter in the cosmos, but its nature is unknown.Whatever it is, it does not reflect or emit detectable light, hence the name.There are three potential explanations for the new signal from the Xenon1T experiment. Two require new physics to explain, while one of them is consistent with the existence of solar axion particles.The findings have been published on the Arxiv pre-print server.So far, scientists have only observed indirect evidence of dark matter. A definitive, direct detection of dark matter particles has yet to be made.There are several theories to account for what that particle might be like. The most favoured one has been the WIMP, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particle. Physicists working on the Xenon series of experiments have spent more than a decade hunting for signs of these WIMPs. But the search has been fruitless.But Xenon1T, the most recent iteration was also sensitive to other candidate particles.The experiment was operated deep underground at the Gran Sasso facility in Italy, from 2016 to 2018. Its detector was filled with 3.2 tonnes of ultra-pure liquefied xenon, two tonnes of which served as a ""target"" for interactions between the xenon atoms and other particles that were passing through.When a particle crosses the target, it can generate tiny flashes of light and free electrons from a xenon atom.Most of these interactions - also known as events - are with particles we already know about, such as muons, cosmic rays and neutrinos. This constitutes what scientists refer to as the background signal.A potential signal from an undiscovered particle needs to be strong enough to rise above this background noise.Scientists carefully estimated the number of background events in Xenon1T. They expected to see roughly 232, but the experiment instead saw 285 - an excess of 53 events.One explanation could be a new, previously unconsidered source of background contamination, caused by the presence of tiny amounts of tritium in the Xenon1T detector. It could also be due to neutrinos, trillions of which pass through your body, unhindered, every second. One explanation could be that the magnetic moment (a property of all particles) of neutrinos is larger than its value in the Standard Model, which categorises the elementary particles in physics. This would be a strong hint that some other new physics is needed to explain it.However, the excess is most consistent with a signal from axions, a very light as-yet undetected class of particle. In fact, the excess of events has an energy spectrum similar to that expected from axions produced in the Sun.While these solar axions are not dark matter candidates, axions produced in the early Universe could be a source of dark matter.In statistical terms, the solar axion hypothesis has a significance of 3.5 sigma.While this significance is fairly high, it is not large enough to conclude that axions exist. Five sigma is generally the accepted threshold for a discovery.The significance of both the tritium and neutrino magnetic moment hypotheses corresponds to 3.2 sigma, meaning that they are also consistent with the data.Scientists working on the Xenon collaboration are currently upgrading to a different iteration called Xenon-nT. With better data from this future version, they are confident they will soon find out whether the excess is a statistical fluke, a background contaminant, or something far more exciting.Follow Paul on Twitter.",17 June 2020,science
Blowing bubbles: Soapy spheres pop pollen on fruit trees,"Japanese researchers have succeeded in fertilising pear trees using pollen carried on the thin film of a soap bubble.They've been searching for alternative approaches to pollination, because of the decline in the number of bees worldwide. When fired from a bubble gun, the delicate soapy spheres achieved a success rate of 95%.The researchers are now testing drones that fire bubbles for pollination.With the decline in bee numbers over the past decade, researchers have been looking at different ways of achieving pollination - a key step in the production of many fruits and vegetables.Dr Eijiro Miyako, from the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, had previously tested the ability of a drone to deliver pollen - but even though the drone was just two centimetres long, it kept damaging the flowers in the process.One day, while watching his young son play in local park, Dr Miyako had a moment of inspiration.""I was playing soap bubbles with my son at a park close to my home, when a soap bubble accidently hit my son's face,"" he told BBC News.""There was no damage because soap bubbles are soft, light, and flexible.""""But I got an inspiration because I thought the bubbles won't damage the flowers and would be an ideal material for pollination.""Dr Miyako commandeered the bubble solution, causing his son to start crying and necessitating the purchase of more bubbles. In the lab, he was able to confirm, via optical microscopy, that soap bubbles could carry pollen.Realising that most conventional soap would be too toxic for flowers, Dr Miyako developed what he terms ""chemically functionalised"" soap bubbles that could each carry up to 2,000 pollen grains. Loading up their bubble guns, Dr Miyako and his colleagues tested the technique at a pear orchard. In the absence of bees, some pollination work is now done by hand using a feather brush.After shooting the bubbles onto the trees, young fruits started to form some 16 days later, at a volume equal to the hand pollination.""The rates of both soap-bubble-mediated pollination and hand pollination were approximately 95%, and no significant differences were observed between them,"" said Dr Miyako.""In fact, the shape and size of young pear fruits after soap bubble pollination look the same as hand pollination. However our method has more potential advantages in terms of future automation and reduction of pollen grains.""Soap bubbles, though, are not without their troubles. The technique creates a lot of waste and the wind and rain can ruin the efforts to pollinate. Dr Miyako believes these restrictions can be overcome through the use of technology such as localisation and mapping, path planning and motion control.Tests have already been carried out with an autonomous drone carrying a bubble gun.The drone was able to hit targets from two metres with a success rate of 90%.Dr Miyako is very optimistic about the potential for technology to succeed in pollination.""Some might dismiss this as something of a fantasy, but the soap bubble is effective for pollination.""""I was probably the only person on the planet to believe this when I started the 'playful' work. Maybe I still am now.""The research has been published in the journal iScience. Follow Matt on Twitter.",17 June 2020,science
Wildlife scientists examine the great 'human pause',"A UK-led team has launched an initiative to track wildlife before, during and after lockdown. The researchers' aim is to study what they have called the ""anthropause"" - the global-scale, temporary slowdown in human activity, which is likely to have a profound impact on other species. Measuring that impact, they say, will reveal ways in which we can ""share our increasingly crowded planet"".They outline this mission in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports. They outline ""urgent steps"" to allow scientists to learn as much as possible from the sudden absence of humans in many landscapes - including ensuring that researchers have access and permission to carry out their work, and can gain access to information about human movement, as well as animal-tracking data. Prof Christian Rutz from the University of St Andrews is president of the International Bio-logging Society. He pointed out that bio-loggers - small tracking devices fitted to animals in order to record their movements and other behaviour - have been collecting information in habitats all over the world throughout the pandemic. ""There is a really valuable research opportunity here, one that's been brought about by the most tragic circumstances, but it's one we think we can't afford to miss,"" he told BBC News.  Usually, studies which try to examine the impact of human presence and activity on wild animals are limited to comparing protected habitats to unprotected areas, or studying landscapes in the wake of a natural disaster. ""But during lockdown we have this replicated around the globe -  in different localities and for habitats where some species have been fitted with tracking devices the whole time,"" said Prof Rutz.There have been many accounts on social media of wildlife apparently making the most of our absence  - moving freely through surprisingly urban settings. In some places though, the lack of human activity appears to have been detrimental - increases in poaching driven by poverty, and the absence of ecotourism. ""No one's saying that humans should stay in lockdown permanently,"" added Prof Rutz. ""But what if we see major impacts of our changes in road use, for example? We could use that to make small changes to our transport network that could have major benefits.""Prof Jim Smith from the University of Portsmouth has been part of what might be considered the first anthropause study - a long-term investigation into the changes in the abandoned landscape around the damaged Chernobyl nuclear power plant.""Just a few years after the evacuation of the Exclusion Zone, Belarussian and Ukrainian researchers found species associated with humans - like pigeons and rats - were disappearing, but wild animals - wild boar, deer and wolf - were multiplying,"" he said.  ""Still abandoned more than 30 years later, the zone has become an iconic example of accidental rewilding.""""At great economic and human cost, Covid and Chernobyl forced us to push the pause button on our environmental damage,"" Prof Smith continued.  ""Stopping some of those impacts altogether will be hard, but will be helped by what we can learn from these extreme events.""Prof Rutz and his team pointed out in their paper: ""Scientific knowledge gained during this devastating crisis will allow us to develop innovative strategies for sharing space on this increasingly crowded planet, with benefits for both wildlife and humans.""Follow Victoria on Twitter",23 June 2020,science
Arctic Circle sees 'highest-ever' recorded temperatures,"Temperatures in the Arctic Circle are likely to have hit an all-time record on Saturday, reaching a scorching 38C (100F) in Verkhoyansk, a Siberian town.The record still needs to be verified, but it appears to have been 18C higher than the average maximum daily temperature in June.Hot summer weather is not uncommon in the Arctic Circle, but recent months have seen abnormally high temperatures.The Arctic is believed to be warming twice as fast as the global average.Verkhoyansk, home to about 1,300 people, sits just inside the Arctic Circle, in remote Siberia. It has an extreme climate with temperatures plunging in January to an average maximum of -42C and then surging in June to 20C.But a persistent heatwave this year in the Arctic Circle has worried meteorologists. In March, April and May, the Copernicus Climate Change service reported that the average temperature was around 10C above normal. Earlier in June, parts of Siberia recorded 30C, while in May, Khatanga in Russia - situated in the Arctic Circle at 72 degrees north - set a new May temperature record of 25.4C.""Year-on-year temperature records are being broken around the world, but the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth,"" said Dr Dann Mitchell, associate professor in atmospheric science at the University of Bristol. ""So it is unsurprising to see records being broken in this region. We will see more of this in the near future.""   Analysis by Simon King, BBC Weather meteorologistHeatwaves in the Arctic aren't unusual. Weather patterns around the world can align in such a way that hot air is transported quite far northward and colder air from the poles southward. Over the last few months a large area of high pressure in eastern Russia has been dominant. This has led to southerly winds bringing warmer air from near the tropics, leading to higher than average temperatures. However, the persistence of this weather pattern has led to a longevity and scale of heat that is worrying. This is consistent with what climatologists believe will happen in the Arctic with climate change.Most scientists agree that over the past 30 years, the Arctic has warmed at a rate of twice the global average. The graphic below shows that across the globe, through the period 1960-2019, average air temperature has generally increased by around 1C.  However, as you head closer to the North Pole - latitude 90° - the reds become darker. This shows how the temperature has increased here more than anywhere else - by around 4C.Warming in the Arctic is leading to the thawing of once permanently frozen permafrost below ground.This is alarming scientists because as permafrost thaws, carbon dioxide and methane previously locked up below ground is released.These greenhouse gases can cause further warming, and further thawing of the permafrost, in a vicious cycle known as positive feedback.The higher temperatures also cause land ice in the Arctic to melt at a faster rate, leading to greater run-off into the ocean where it contributes to sea-level rise.There is also an element of positive feedback here, says BBC Weather, because the loss of highly reflective white ice means that the ground and sea absorb more heat. This leads to more warming.The impact of wildfires are also a consideration. Last summer, they ravaged parts of the Arctic. Although they are common in summer, high temperatures and strong winds made them unusually severe.They typically start in early May before peaking in July and August but by late April this year they were already ten times bigger in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia compared to the same time last year, Russia's emergencies minister said.Well, 2020 is certainly shaping up to be a contender.  The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, reckons there's a 50:50 chance it'll be the hottest year ever recorded. Much of northern Europe and Asia has had an exceptionally mild spring and early summer with temperatures 10C higher than normal in some areas. The hottest year to date is 2016. It is still a nose ahead, but the margins are ""very close"".Of course, this should come as no surprise.""We've upset the energy balance of the entire planet,"" cautions Prof Chris Rapley of University College London. Year after year we see temperature records being broken, the eminent climate scientist says.""This is a warning message from the Earth itself,"" he tells me. ""We ignore it at our peril.""",22 June 2020,science
Climate change: Planting new forests 'can do more harm than good',"Rather than benefiting the environment, large-scale tree planting may do the opposite, two new studies have found.One paper says that financial incentives to plant trees can backfire and reduce biodiversity with little impact on carbon emissions. A separate project found that the amount of carbon that new forests can absorb may be overestimated. The key message from both papers is that planting trees is not a simple climate solution. Over the past few years, the idea of planting trees as a low cost, high impact solution to climate change has really taken hold. Previous studies have indicated that trees have enormous potential to soak up and store carbon, and many countries have established tree planting campaigns as a key element of their plans to tackle climate change. In the UK, promises by the political parties to plant ever larger numbers of trees were a feature of last year's general election.In the US, even President Donald Trump has rowed in behind the Trillion Trees Campaign.Legislation to support the idea has been introduced into the US Congress.Another major tree planting initiative is called the Bonn Challenge.Countries are being urged to restore 350 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2030.So far, around 40 nations have endorsed the idea.But scientists have urged caution against the headlong rush to plant new forests. They point to the fact that in the Bonn Challenge nearly 80% of the commitments made to date involve planting monoculture plantations or a limited mix of trees that produce specific products such as fruit or rubber. The authors of this new study have looked closely at the financial incentives given to private landowners to plant trees. These payments are seen as a key element of increasing the number of trees significantly. The study looked at the example of Chile, where a decree subsidising tree planting ran from 1974 to 2012, and was widely seen as a globally influential afforestation policy.The law subsidised 75% of the costs of planting new forests. While it was intended not to apply to existing forests, lax enforcement and budgetary limitations meant that some landowners simply replaced native forests with more profitable new tree plantations. Their study found the subsidy scheme expanded the area covered by trees, but decreased the area of native forest. The authors point out that since Chile's native forests are rich in biodiversity and store large amounts of carbon, the subsidy scheme failed to increase the carbon stores and accelerated biodiversity loss.""If policies to incentivise tree plantations are poorly designed or poorly enforced, there is a high risk of not only wasting public money but also releasing more carbon and losing biodiversity,"" said co-author Prof Eric Lambin, from Stanford University. ""That's the exact opposite of what these policies are aiming for.""A second study set out to examine how much carbon a newly planted forest would be able to absorb from the atmosphere.Up until now, many scientists have calculated the amount of carbon that trees can pull down from the air using a fixed ratio.Suspecting that this ratio would depend on local conditions, the researchers looked at northern China, which has seen intensive tree planting by the government because of climate change but also in an effort to reduce dust from the Gobi desert. Looking at 11,000 soil samples taken from afforested plots, the scientists found that in carbon poor soils, adding new trees did increase the density of organic carbon. But where soils were already rich in carbon, adding new trees decreased this density. The authors say that previous assumptions about how much organic carbon can be fixed by planting new trees is likely an overestimate. ""We hope that people can understand that afforestation practices are not one single thing,"" said Dr Anping Chen, from Colorado State University and a lead author on the study. ""Afforestation involves many technical details and balances of different parts, and it cannot solve all our climate problems.""Both papers have been published in the journal Nature Sustainability.Follow Matt on Twitter.",22 June 2020,science
One-fifth of Earth's ocean floor is now mapped,"We've just become a little less ignorant about Planet Earth.The initiative that seeks to galvanise the creation of a full map of the ocean floor says one-fifth of this task has now been completed.When the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project was launched in 2017, only 6% of the global ocean bottom had been surveyed to what might be called modern standards.That number now stands at 19%, up from 15% in just the last year.Some 14.5 million sq km of new bathymetric (depth) data was included in the GEBCO grid in 2019 - an area equivalent to almost twice that of Australia.It does, however, still leave a great swathe of the planet in need of mapping to an acceptable degree.""Today we stand at the 19% level. That means we've got another 81% of the oceans still to survey, still to map. That's an area about twice the size of Mars that we have to capture in the next decade,"" project director Jamie McMichael-Phillips told BBC News.The map at the top of this page illustrates the challenge faced by GEBCO in the coming years. Black represents those areas where we have yet to get direct echosounding measurements of the shape of the ocean floor. Blues correspond to water depth (deeper is purple, shallower is lighter blue). It's not true to say we have no idea of what's in the black zones; satellites have actually taught us a great deal. Certain spacecraft carry altimeter instruments that can infer seafloor topography from the way its gravity sculpts the water surface above - but this only gives a best resolution at over a kilometre, and Seabed 2030 has a desire for a resolution of at least 100m everywhere.Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons.They are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines.They are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water.This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a critical role in moving heat around the planet. And if you want to understand precisely how sea-levels will rise in different parts  of the world, good ocean-floor maps are a must.Much of the data that's been imported into the GEBCO grid recently has been in existence for some time but was ""sitting on a shelf"" out of the public domain. The companies, institutions and governments that were holding this information have now handed it over - and there is probably a lot more of this hidden resource still to be released.But new acquisitions will also be required. Some of these will come from a great crowdsourcing effort - from ships, big and small, routinely operating their echo-sounding equipment as they transit the globe. Even small vessels - fishing boats and yachts - can play their part by attaching data-loggers to their sonar and navigation equipment. One very effective strategy is evidenced by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which operates in the more remote parts of the globe - and that is simply to mix up the routes taken by ships.""Very early on we adopted the ethos that data should be collected on passage - on the way to where we were going, not just at the site of interest,"" explained BAS scientist Dr Rob Larter. ""A beautiful example of this is the recent bathymetric map of the Drake Passage area (between South America and Antarctica). A lot of that was acquired by different research projects as they fanned out and moved back and forth to the places they were going.""New technology will be absolutely central to the GEBCO quest. Ocean Infinity, a prominent UK-US company that conducts seafloor surveys, is currently building a fleet of robotic surface vessels through a subsidiary it calls Armada. This start-up's MD, Dan Hook, says low-cost, uncrewed vehicles may be the only way to close some of the gaps in the more out-of-the-way locations in the 2030 grid.He told BBC News: ""When you look at the the mapping of the seabed in areas closer to shore, you see the business case very quickly. Whether it's for wind farms or cable-laying - there are lots of people that want to know what's down there. But when it's those very remote areas of the planet, the case then is really only a scientific one.""    Jamie McMichael-Phillips is confident his project's target can be met if everyone pulls together.""I am confident, but to do it we will need partnerships. We need governments, we need industry, we need academics, we need philanthropists, and we need citizen scientists. We need all these individuals to come together if we're to deliver an ocean map that is absolutely fundamental and essential to humankind.""GEBCO stands for General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans. It is the only intergovernmental organisation with a mandate to map the entire ocean floor.
