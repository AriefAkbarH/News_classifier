Nasa SpaceX launch: 10 questions about the mission,"Elon Musk's company SpaceX is about to launch its space vehicle - the Crew Dragon - with astronauts onboard for the first time. Here, we answer some common questions about the mission.Nasa has been planning to hand over the transport of crew to the International Space Station (ISS) since the early 2000s. After the Columbia space shuttle broke up during its return to Earth in 2003, the space agency focused on developing a replacement spaceship that could travel to the Moon. Involving private firms in the transfer of crew and cargo to the ISS was a necessary step to afford that programme. In 2014, entrepreneur Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing were announced as winners of a Nasa contract for crew transport services. SpaceX is launching its spacecraft first; the Crew Dragon spacecraft will lift off on Wednesday atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.SpaceX is an American company that provides commercial and government launch services on its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. Entrepreneur Elon Musk founded the company in 2002, with the goal of reducing space transportation costs, enabling the colonisation of Mars. SpaceX was the first private company to routinely return rocket stages to Earth under propulsive power so they could be re-flown rather than being discarded. It has been conducting regular flights of cargo to the ISS, and will now aim to begin launching astronauts. Musk's company is also developing a bigger spacecraft to carry humans - called Starship - which could begin the process of settling Mars.Born in South Africa, Elon Musk made more than $160m from the sale of online payment service PayPal to eBay. His desire to see humanity become a true space-faring civilisation was a driving factor behind the founding of SpaceX. But he has also been involved in founding a variety of other companies such as the electric car manufacturer Tesla. He also conceived a project called Hyperloop, a high-speed transportation system using pods that travel through a system of tubes. His colourful personality and lifestyle made him the inspiration for Robert Downey Jr's interpretation of Marvel Comics character Tony Stark. Musk is no stranger to controversy: his tweets have triggered lawsuits and led to him being forced out as the chairman of Tesla (though he remained as CEO).Since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011, Nasa has been paying Russia tens of millions of dollars to launch its astronauts on the Soyuz spacecraft. The Crew Dragon launch from Florida marks the first launch of humans from US soil in nine years. As such, it is seen as crucial for restoring American prestige in human spaceflight. This will also be the first time a private company has launched astronauts into orbit.The Crew Dragon is the spacecraft that will transport astronauts to the ISS on Wednesday. It is a sleek evolution of the Dragon spacecraft which was built to ferry cargo to the orbiting outpost. The Crew Dragon is designed to carry a maximum of seven passengers, but Nasa flights will carry four, with the rest of the space taken up by supplies. It is equipped with thrusters that enable it to manoeuvre in space and will dock - or attach - to the space station under autonomous control. Unlike previous spacecraft designed for humans, the crew cabin features touchscreen controls in place of physical buttons.Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley are Nasa astronauts. They were selected in 2000 and have each flown to space twice on the space shuttle. They are among the most experienced members of Nasa's astronaut corps and both trained as test pilots - which has been critical for putting the new spacecraft through its paces. Hurley has spent a total of 28 days and 11 hours in space, while Behnken has accumulated a total of 29 days and 12 hours, including 37 hours of spacewalking time. Both men are also married to astronauts.Spacecraft designed to carry astronauts have to go through a process that ensures they can operate safely. This launch is essentially the final step in that validation process. Once in orbit, Behnken and Hurley will test the Crew Dragon's environmental control system, the displays and controls and the manoeuvring thrusters. They will monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station and will become members of the ISS crew. At the orbiting outpost, they will continue performing tests on the Crew Dragon along with other tasks related to the space station. When it's time to return to Earth, the Crew Dragon will parachute down into the Atlantic Ocean. The capsule and crew will then be recovered by a ship called Go Navigator.The Crew Dragon has a built-in abort system, designed to save the lives of its crew in the event of an emergency. If there's a problem during lift-off, such as a rocket engine cut-off, the Crew Dragon will fire engines to propel the vehicle and its occupants free of the rocket. The capsule will then parachute down to safety. SpaceX successfully conducted a test of its in-flight abort system on 19 January 2020.The flight suits that Behnken and Hurley will wear in the capsule look very different to previous designs. In stark contrast to the bulky pumpkin-coloured suits and round helmets familiar from the space shuttle era, SpaceX's suits are slimline, white, one-piece numbers with sleek, 3D-printed helmets. Each one is custom made for the astronaut. If they look like something from a science fiction movie, that's probably because their look was devised by Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez, who has worked on the Batman, X-Men and Thor movies. But the suits also have to be practical; they're designed to keep the crew alive in the event of a cabin depressurisation - where the air is lost from the inside of the spacecraft.If the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission is successful, SpaceX will proceed with the six ""operational"" missions to the ISS they are required to fly under their $2.6bn contract with Nasa.

Pollution: Birds 'ingesting hundreds of bits of plastic a day',"Birds living on river banks are ingesting plastic at the rate of hundreds of tiny fragments a day, according to a new study.Scientists say this is the first clear evidence that plastic pollutants in rivers are finding their way into wildlife and moving up the food chain.Pieces of plastic 5mm or smaller (microplastics), including polyester, polypropylene and nylon, are known to pollute rivers. The impacts on wildlife are unclear. Researchers at Cardiff University looked at plastic pollutants found in a bird known as a dipper, which wades or dives into rivers in search of underwater insects.""These iconic birds, the dippers, are ingesting hundreds of pieces of plastic every day,"" said Prof Steve Ormerod of Cardiff University's Water Research Institute. ""They're also feeding this material to their chicks.""Previous research has shown that half of the insects in the rivers of south Wales contain microplastic fragments.""The fact that so many river insects are contaminated makes it inevitable that fish, birds and other predators will pick up these polluted prey - but this is the first time that this type of transfer through food webs has been shown clearly in free-living river animals,"" said co-researcher Dr Joseph D'Souza.The research team examined droppings and regurgitated pellets from dippers living near rivers running from the Brecon Beacons down to the Severn Estuary.They found microplastic fragments in roughly half of 166 samples taken from adults and nestlings, at 14 of 15 sites studied, with the greatest concentrations in urban locations. Most were fibres from textiles or building materials.Calculations suggest dippers are ingesting around 200 tiny fragments of plastic a day from the insects they consume.Previous studies have shown that microplastics are present even in the depths of the ocean and are ending up in the bodies of living organisms, from seals to crabs to seabirds.Rivers are a major route between land and sea for microplastics such as synthetic clothing fibres, tyre dust and other fragmenting plastic waste. The research, published in the journal Global Change Biology, was carried out in collaboration with the Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter.Follow Helen on Twitter.",22 May 2020,science
Nature: Bumblebees' 'clever trick' fools plants into flowering,"Scientists have discovered a new behaviour among bumblebees that tricks plants into flowering early. Researchers found that when deprived of pollen, bumblebees will nibble on the leaves of flowerless plants. The damage done seems to fool the plant into flowering, sometimes up to 30 days earlier than normal. Writing in the journal Science, the scientists say they have struggled to replicate the bees' trick in the laboratory.With their fuzzy appearance and distinctive drone, bumblebees are hard to miss in gardens all over the world. Their dense, hairy bodies make them excellent pollinators for crops like tomatoes and blueberries.They are among the first bees to emerge each year and work a long season. Some colonies remain active through the winter in southern and urban areas of the UK.But despite their key role, bumblebees, like many other pollinators have seen their numbers tumble in recent decades.One recent study pointed to climate change, reporting that an increasing number of hot days in Europe and North America was boosting local extinction rates. But researchers have now made a discovery about bumblebees that could have relevance to their long-term survival.Scientists in Switzerland found that when the bees were deprived of pollen, they started to nibble on the leaves of plants that hadn't yet flowered.The bees used their proboscises and mandibles (mouthparts) to cut distinctively-shaped holes in the leaves.But the creatures didn't eat the material or use it in their nests.The damaged plants responded by blooming earlier than normal - in some cases up to 30 days ahead of schedule.""I think everything that we've found is consistent with the idea that the bees are damaging the plants and that that's an adaptation that brings flowers online earlier and that benefits the bees,"" said Dr Mark Mescher, one of the authors from ETH Zurich, told BBC News.When the researchers tried to emulate the damage done to the plants by the bumblebees they weren't able to achieve the same results. The bee-damaged plants flowered 30 days earlier than undamaged plants and 25 days earlier than ones damaged by the scientists. The research team believes there may be something else going on here apart from nibbles.""We really tried to replicate with the best of our ability,"" said Prof Consuelo De Moraes, also from ETH Zurich.""It's possible that the bees also have some cue that they are providing to the plants that is specific to the bee.""""And that could be secretions that we don't know about but it's something that we plan to investigate.""The researchers say the damage has a particular pattern that the scientists have learned to recognise, even in the most unlikely places. ""You see these semi-circular sort of incisions, often in the leaf,"" said Dr Mescher. ""One of the students was saying that they were eating a salad the other day, and they saw that kind of damage on the leaf that was probably from a bumblebee.""The researchers say that when pollen is available the bees don't damage plants. They've also found this behaviour is in wild bees.However the team are keeping an open mind on whether the plants might be the ones in the driving seat. It is vital for plants that depend on pollination to have their flowers on display when the pollinators are buzzing around. It could be that some plants have evolved a strategy to push out their flowers when they recognise the bee doing damage to their leaves. Ultimately, though, knowing more about the relationship between bumblebees and flowering might have implications for the resilience of these creatures in the face of a changing environment.""I think it's fascinating how much we still don't know about organisms that we think we know really well,"" said Prof De Moraes.""It absolutely increases our sense of wonder at the cleverness of nature in all its many forms.""Follow Matt on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science

Nasa SpaceX launch: 10 questions about the mission,"Elon Musk's company SpaceX is about to launch its space vehicle - the Crew Dragon - with astronauts onboard for the first time. Here, we answer some common questions about the mission.Nasa has been planning to hand over the transport of crew to the International Space Station (ISS) since the early 2000s. After the Columbia space shuttle broke up during its return to Earth in 2003, the space agency focused on developing a replacement spaceship that could travel to the Moon. Involving private firms in the transfer of crew and cargo to the ISS was a necessary step to afford that programme. In 2014, entrepreneur Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing were announced as winners of a Nasa contract for crew transport services. SpaceX is launching its spacecraft first; the Crew Dragon spacecraft will lift off on Wednesday atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.SpaceX is an American company that provides commercial and government launch services on its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. Entrepreneur Elon Musk founded the company in 2002, with the goal of reducing space transportation costs, enabling the colonisation of Mars. SpaceX was the first private company to routinely return rocket stages to Earth under propulsive power so they could be re-flown rather than being discarded. It has been conducting regular flights of cargo to the ISS, and will now aim to begin launching astronauts.

Pollution: Birds 'ingesting hundreds of bits of plastic a day',"Birds living on river banks are ingesting plastic at the rate of hundreds of tiny fragments a day, according to a new study.Scientists say this is the first clear evidence that plastic pollutants in rivers are finding their way into wildlife and moving up the food chain.Pieces of plastic 5mm or smaller (microplastics), including polyester, polypropylene and nylon, are known to pollute rivers. The impacts on wildlife are unclear. Researchers at Cardiff University looked at plastic pollutants found in a bird known as a dipper, which wades or dives into rivers in search of underwater insects.""These iconic birds, the dippers, are ingesting hundreds of pieces of plastic every day,"" said Prof Steve Ormerod of Cardiff University's Water Research Institute. ""They're also feeding this material to their chicks.""Previous research has shown that half of the insects in the rivers of south Wales contain microplastic fragments.""The fact that so many river insects are contaminated makes it inevitable that fish, birds and other predators will pick up these polluted prey - but this is the first time that this type of transfer through food webs has been shown clearly in free-living river animals,"" said co-researcher Dr Joseph D'Souza.The research team examined droppings and regurgitated pellets from dippers living near rivers running from the Brecon Beacons down to the Severn Estuary.They found microplastic fragments in roughly half of 166 samples taken from adults and nestlings, at 14 of 15 sites studied, with the greatest concentrations in urban locations. Most were fibres from textiles or building materials.Calculations suggest dippers are ingesting around 200 tiny fragments of plastic a day from the insects they consume.Previous studies have shown that microplastics are present even in the depths of the ocean and are ending up in the bodies of living organisms, from seals to crabs to seabirds.Rivers are a major route between land and sea for microplastics such as synthetic clothing fibres, tyre dust and other fragmenting plastic waste.

Nature: Bumblebees' 'clever trick' fools plants into flowering,"Scientists have discovered a new behaviour among bumblebees that tricks plants into flowering early. Researchers found that when deprived of pollen, bumblebees will nibble on the leaves of flowerless plants. The damage done seems to fool the plant into flowering, sometimes up to 30 days earlier than normal. Writing in the journal Science, the scientists say they have struggled to replicate the bees' trick in the laboratory.With their fuzzy appearance and distinctive drone, bumblebees are hard to miss in gardens all over the world. Their dense, hairy bodies make them excellent pollinators for crops like tomatoes and blueberries.They are among the first bees to emerge each year and work a long season. Some colonies remain active through the winter in southern and urban areas of the UK.But despite their key role, bumblebees, like many other pollinators have seen their numbers tumble in recent decades.One recent study pointed to climate change, reporting that an increasing number of hot days in Europe and North America was boosting local extinction rates. But researchers have now made a discovery about bumblebees that could have relevance to their long-term survival.Scientists in Switzerland found that when the bees were deprived of pollen, they started to nibble on the leaves of plants that hadn't yet flowered.The bees used their proboscises and mandibles (mouthparts) to cut distinctively-shaped holes in the leaves.But the creatures didn't eat the material or use it in their nests.The damaged plants responded by blooming earlier than normal - in some cases up to 30 days ahead of schedule.""I think everything that we've found is consistent with the idea that the bees are damaging the plants and that that's an adaptation that brings flowers online earlier and that benefits the bees,"" said Dr Mark Mescher, one of the authors from ETH Zurich, told BBC News.When the researchers tried to emulate the damage done to the plants by the bumblebees they weren't able to achieve the same results. The bee-damaged plants flowered 30 days earlier than undamaged plants and 25 days earlier than ones damaged by the scientists. The research team believes there may be something else going on here apart from nibbles.""We really tried to replicate with the best of our ability,"" said Prof Consuelo De Moraes, also from ETH Zurich.""It's possible that the bees also have some cue that they are providing to the plants that is specific to the bee.""""And that could be secretions that we don't know about but it's something that we plan to investigate.""The researchers say the damage has a particular pattern that the scientists have learned to recognise, even in the most unlikely places. ""You see these semi-circular sort of incisions, often in the leaf,"" said Dr Mescher. ""One of the students was saying that they were eating a salad the other day, and they saw that kind of damage on the leaf that was probably from a bumblebee.""The researchers say that when pollen is available the bees don't damage plants. They've also found this behaviour is in wild bees.However the team are keeping an open mind on whether the plants might be the ones in the driving seat. It is vital for plants that depend on pollination to have their flowers on display when the pollinators are buzzing around. It could be that some plants have evolved a strategy to push out their flowers when they recognise the bee doing damage to their leaves. Ultimately, though, knowing more about the relationship between bumblebees and flowering might have implications for the resilience of these creatures in the face of a changing environment.""I think it's fascinating how much we still don't know about organisms that we think we know really well,"" said Prof De Moraes.""It absolutely increases our sense of wonder at the cleverness of nature in all its many forms.""Follow Matt on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science

Nasa SpaceX launch: Astronauts get to work ahead of historic flight,"Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have flown into the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare for their historic mission next week.The pair's trip to the International Space Station (ISS) will be made in a rocket and capsule system provided by a commercial company, SpaceX. Nasa has traditionally always owned and operated its space vehicles.But that is a capability it gave up in 2011 when it retired the last of the space shuttles.The agency now intends to contract out all future crew transportation to low-Earth orbit.  Hurley and Behnken flew into Florida from the agency's human spaceflight headquarters in Texas where they have been in quarantine. They'll continue protecting their health at Kennedy as they get ready for next Wednesday's planned lift-off.Thursday will see teams from SpaceX and Nasa hold a flight readiness review to confirm all preparation activities are good to proceed.The astronauts' rocket, a Falcon-9, and capsule, known as Dragon, will be wheeled out to the spaceport's famous launch pad - complex 39A - shortly for its static fire test. This will see the Falcon ignite briefly all nine of its first-stage engines to check they are fit to go. Hurley and Behnken, together with ground-support staff, will also conduct a ""crew dry dress"" rehearsal.This will involve the men suiting up, riding out to the pad and even climbing into their capsule as a dummy run to ensure everyone understands their role.Of the Dragon, Hurley said: ""It's just an amazing vehicle. It's definitely not the space shuttle. It's much smaller; it's a capsule. It's state-of-the-art from a technology standpoint, and we are so excited to be in a real spaceship and not the simulator here in just a week.""Behnken said the pair felt the weight of history. This is only the fifth time American astronauts will have flown to orbit in a brand new spacecraft design.""We certainly take inspiration from all those who've come before us. Whenever we've had a chance to speak with the astronauts who had those opportunities - the thing they've emphasised is, in the moment, being as prepared and ready for whatever may come your way as possible,"" he told reporters at Kennedy.Next week's launch is key moment in Nasa's strategy to change the way it conducts its space activity. Its commercial crew programme, initiated in 2010, selected both SpaceX and aerospace heavyweight Boeing to develop crew transportation services.The arrangement with the companies means they can also sell seats in their vehicles to other space agencies, companies or indeed wealthy individuals.""We are on the cusp of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil yet again,"" explained Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.   ""This time we're doing it differently than we've ever done it before. We are partnering with commercial industry with the intent that they would go get customers that are not Nasa, and drive down our costs and increase the access to space.""For the moment, this model only covers flights to a few hundred kilometres above the Earth, to the ISS. But eventually the aim is to extend the concept to operations in deeper space.In April, Nasa asked three teams to develop ideas for landing its astronauts on the Moon. Again, this would be a service the agency would purchase. Lift-off for Hurley and Behnken next Wednesday is scheduled for 16:33 local time (21:33 BST/20:33 GMT).",21 May 2020,science
Covid recovery could 'tip the balance' for nature,"Environmental scientists have called for the conservation of nature to be at the centre of the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.With countries still ensnared by the crisis, scientists have urged governments to make plans that ""safeguard biodiversity and human health"" as they rebuild. The researchers published an open letter in the journal Science.""How we emerge from lockdowns,"" they say, ""will drive a new world economy."" This is likely to have lasting effects on global biodiversity, the Australian authors argue.The right long-term plans, from governments and international organisations, could ""tip the balance"" in favour of nature. There are some striking examples of upheavals that have had unintended benefits for nature. The catastrophic nuclear accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine, and the resulting exclusion zone around the plant, created an unplanned wilderness that has since been designated an ecological reserve. ""The Colombia Conflict, for example, created unofficial protected areas,"" explained Dr Ryan Pearson from Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. ""This slowed environmental degradation because people were fearful of entering remote areas occupied by rebels.""The more recent ""post-conflict"" increase in deforestation there shows the need for longer-term strategies that can maintain the positive side effects of crises.""There have been many reports of wild animals increasing in numbers and turning up in places they haven't been seen i a long time,"" Dr Pearson told BBC News. "" This carries implications that certain species may be benefiting from the absence of human influence during lockdowns or possibly because of reduced pollution, especially in waterways.""We can't be sure how long such effects will last unless long-term strategies are implemented to encourage them.""There is, the scientists say, a concern that the rush to re-stabilise and grow economies may come ""at the expense of the environment"".This group of environmental scientists are adding their voices to a call for a greener focus as the world rebuilds. Dr Pearson added: ""We hope our letter will encourage positive strategies to support biodiversity into legislation, and the behaviour of people in their choices - in their consumption, investment, and travel.""Follow Victoria on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
Climate change: Top 10 tips to reduce carbon footprint revealed,"Climate change can still be tackled – but only if people are willing to embrace major shifts in the way we live, a report says.The authors have put together a list of the best ways for people to reduce their carbon footprints.The response to the Covid-19 crisis has shown that the public is willing to accept radical change if they consider it necessary, they explain.And the report adds that government priorities must be re-ordered.Protecting the planet must become the first duty of all decision-makers, the researchers argue.The authors urge the public to contribute by adopting the carbon-cutting measures in the report, which is based on an analysis of 7,000 other studies.Top of the list is living car-free, which saves an average of 2.04 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually. This is followed by driving a battery electric car - 1.95 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually - and taking one less long-haul flight each year - 1.68 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person.Switching to a vegan diet will help - but less than tackling transport, the research shows.It says popular activities such as recycling are worthwhile, but don’t cut emissions by as much.The lead author, Dr Diana Ivanova from Leeds University, told BBC News: “We need a complete change of mindset. “We have to agree how much carbon we can each emit within the limits of what the planet can bear – then make good lives within those boundaries.“The top 10 options are available to us now, without the need for controversial and expensive new technologies.” Dr Ivanova said the coronavirus lockdown has shown that many people could live without cars if public transport, walking and cycling were improved.Her research highlights rich people who typically take more flights, drive bigger cars and consume the most. She said: “All the world suffers from climate change, but it’s not the average person who flies regularly – it’s a small group, yet aviation is under-taxed. It’s a moral issue.”In her league table, buying renewable power and using public transport rank fourth and fifth.Sixth is insulating your home well, which saves 0.895 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.Seventh is switching to a vegan diet, which saves 0.8 tonnes. Other top actions are using heat pumps; switching from polluting cookstoves (in developing countries) to better methods of cooking, and heating buildings with renewable energy. Dr Ivanova said that if people implemented the measures, it would save around nine tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per person per year.Current annual household emissions are around 10 tonnes in the UK, and 17 in the US.The study, out soon in the journal Environmental Research Letters, says the following are worthwhile, but of lesser benefit to the climate: green roofs; using less paper; buying more durable items; turning down the thermostat - and recycling, which saves 0.01 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to Dr Ivanova.Some of the findings will be questioned. Polls suggest some people think climate is as important as the virus, for instance, but some don’t.Professor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “This is a valuable study. But it only looks at the carbon footprint and not at other impacts like water scarcity because of lithium mining for electric car batteries.Libby Peake, from the Green Alliance think tank, told BBC News: “People shouldn’t stop good habits like recycling, which saves some carbon while preventing waste and conserving resources.”  “Better design allows people to buy fewer but higher-quality things and to live in buildings with lower carbon footprints. These savings aren’t necessarily covered by this study.” Follow Roger on Twitter.",20 May 2020,science
Climate change: Scientists fear car surge will see CO2 rebound,"Daily global emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to Covid-19, say scientists.The most comprehensive account yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys. But the authors are worried that, as people return to work, car use will soar again.They fear CO2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis.They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real, durable changes on transport and personal mobility.In the UK, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged £250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure. Other countries are also looking at similar plans.The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to Covid-19 have had a significant impact on the carbon-producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do.Road transport has declined hugely, as has aviation. However, now that the UK is beginning to return to work, Mr Shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport, should walking or cycling not be an option.""If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than travelling by bus, train or tram,"" he said.Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed. Now in detailed analysis, researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of CO2.They've calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97% of global emissions.During the peak of the crisis in early April, daily emissions dropped by 17% compared to the previous year, meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day.The key to the fall has been cars. Surface transport emissions have declined by 43%, the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined. While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact, it only accounts for 10% of the decrease during the pandemic. China has been responsible for the biggest drop, followed by the US, Europe and India.If some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year, then global emissions will likely drop by 7%. If pre-pandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by mid-June, the annual fall would be around 4%. But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound, especially on the roads, could see a carbon surge.Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants, too. One of the UK's leading experts, Prof Frank Kelly, from King's College London, said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two years before US authorities exposed the scandal.He told Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road.Prof Kelly said he reported it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they didn't publish his findings. He said work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal action against car makers that had installed ""defeat devices"" to fool regulators.The government didn't deny the account. A spokesperson said: ""We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the World Health Organization as an 'example for the rest of the world to follow'"".Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 crisis, he said levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60% in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown.Levels of another pollutant, sooty particles, remained at harmful concentrations.""A big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work, and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before, once everybody goes back,"" said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia, who led the analysis.The researchers say that fundamental, systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change. When it comes to transportation, there are huge opportunities, according to Prof Le Quéré. She says that after the global financial crisis in 2008, some governments like China, US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables. ""Here now in 2020 we're very close to the same situation in electric mobility,"" she told BBC News.""Battery prices have come down, we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies.""""So if these two things can align, then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow.""Grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change. A letter signed by 155 major companies, representing $2.4 trillion (£1.96 trillion) in market capitalisation, calls for a net-zero emissions response to the covid crisis. Corporations including Carlsberg, Iberdrola, EDF and Coca Cola Europe say they want governments to ""prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy"".The authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action. They point to the fact that while emissions of CO2 may be temporarily reduced, all the while CO2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet.It will take a a dramatic shift to change that. ""I think very much that we are at a crossroads. And at this point, like the UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, it could go either way.""""He was talking about his own health, but here we're talking about the health of the planet.""""It could go either way.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Follow Matt on Twitter.",19 May 2020,science
Antarctic algal blooms: 'Green snow' mapped from space,"UK scientists have created the first wide-area maps of microscopic algae growing in coastal Antarctica.Satellite observations were used to count nearly 1,700 patches where large blooms had turned snow cover green.The team says the photosynthesising organisms are an important ""sink"" for pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.They are also key actors in the cycling of nutrients in what is one the most remote regions on Earth.""These are primary producers at the bottom of a food chain. If there are changes in the algae, it obviously has knock-on effects further up the food chain,"" explained study leader Dr Matt Davey from Cambridge University.""And even though the numbers we're talking about are small on a global scale, on an Antarctic scale they're substantially important,"" the ecologist, who has since joined the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban, told BBC News.Detecting the green algae from space was a tricky task. While it's easy to spot the organisms' discolouration when walking in the snow on the ground, from orbit it becomes much harder to tease out the blooms' signal against what is a highly reflective surface.Fortunately for the team, the European Union's Sentinel-2 spacecraft have high-fidelity detectors that are sensitive in just the right part of the light spectrum to make the observation. The study mapped the Antarctic Peninsula, the finger of land which points up from the White Continent towards South America. The blooms are seen predominantly to be on the western side of this feature. Two-thirds were on the many islands that dot the coastline. Totalled, the microscopic algae covered an area of almost 2 sq km. It means they're tying up roughly 500 tonnes of carbon a year. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon that would be emitted by about 875,000 average petrol car journeys in the UK, the team calculates.These numbers are an underestimate because the Sentinel-2 system is only picking up green algae and missing their red and orange counterparts - an issue of the satellite camera detectors' spectral bands not being sensitive at just the right wavelengths for those particular blooms.""It's frustrating because we've shown how to do it on the WorldView-3 spacecraft but its imagery is just too expensive. Sentinel is free,"" explained Dr Andrew Gray, who is affiliated to both Cambridge and the NERC Field Spectroscopy Facility in Edinburgh.The problem would be resolved in time as more open-data satellites were launched, the remote-sensing specialist added. Algal blooms in the Antarctic were first described by expeditions in the 1950s and 1960s. They can look spectacular when they tinge slopes with a broad swathe of colour to contrast the surrounding white. This makes them a popular subject for cruise ship tourists and their cameras.To flourish, the organisms need an available supply of liquid water and that's to be found in snowy areas just above freezing, as opposed to those places of deep cold and ice.The blooms' distribution is also heavily influenced by the proximity of seals, penguins and other Antarctic birds, such as skuas and kelp gulls. The ""poop"" from these creatures is a source of essential nitrogen and other elements. The interesting question is what happens to the blooms as the Antarctic warms. Temperatures on the peninsula rose rapidly in the latter half of the 20th Century, and climate models expect this trend to continue in coming decades.Many of the algal fields on low-lying islands could simply disappear if their snows are completely removed. On the other hand, new opportunities are likely to open up on the mainland, further to the south and at higher elevations.""There are probably many different species of algae, all with quite different niches. Some will live right at the top of the snow surface, others quite a bit deeper - and their numbers will change depending on the temperature,"" observed Prof Alison Smith, a biologist at Cambridge.       ""But we don't know yet whether their numbers will increase or decrease. And if you don't monitor the situation, you'll never know,"" she told BBC News.The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, involved additional team-members from the British Antarctic Survey and Edinburgh University.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",20 May 2020,science
Climate change: Future floods will delay emergency response,"Future increases in rainfall in England could significantly impact emergency responses, according to a new study.Researchers say that flood conditions could see just 9% of some rural populations reached by an ambulance within the 7-15 minute mandatory timeframe.Older people living in rural areas would be worst affected, the authors say.They say there should be a rethink on ambulance locations in flooding events.Flooding is one of the most devastating impacts of climate change. According to studies, it is likely to increase in the future. The Met Office has indicated that an extended period of extreme rainfall in winter, similar to what was seen in parts of England between 2013 and 2014 is now about seven times more likely because of human-induced climate change. To find out how this changing rainfall might impact on ambulance and fire and rescue services, researchers projected the impacts of floods that might occur once in 30 years, once in 100 years and once in 1,000 years.In England, emergency responders must reach urgent cases within mandatory timeframes, regardless of the weather conditions. In normal conditions, around 84% of England's population can be reached by ambulance in around seven minutes. The researchers found that when a once in 30-year flood event struck, this dropped to 67%. With a once in a 100-year flood, just over half the population would be reachable in seven minutes, while in a once in a 1,000-year flood, only 27% of the total population would see an ambulance inside that time limit.Different locations had different outcomes according to the study. East Riding and Berkshire would see their coverage reduce to 9% and 12% respectively. ""Even the small magnitude floods affect the emergency response,"" said lead author Prof Dapeng Yu from Loughborough University.""Ambulance services have been centralised in recent decades, so in villages or small towns there's no ambulance service, therefore when an incident happens in rural areas, it takes a lot longer for them to reach.""As well as rural areas, large urban centres including London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Newcastle, would also see a reduction in response time under a 30-year flood.Care homes, sheltered accommodation, nurseries and schools would be among the most vulnerable locations with older people in rural areas likely worst-hit, according to the study. The authors say that the day of the Brexit referendum on 23 June in 2016 is a good example of what can happen to the emergency services during surface flooding events. Referendum day was memorable for large-scale surface flooding in many parts of London after torrential rain.Around 450 flooding incidents were attended by the London Fire and Rescue Service, which was three times the number from the previous day.The London fire service target timeframe for reaching incidents is six minutes and on June 23, 59% of journeys were outside that target. ""You don't know when it's going to hit and you don't know how hard it is going to hit,"" said Prof Dapeng Yu.""But when it happens, like in London during the referendum day, it is really striking.""""It really shows the impacts, you will receive three times more calls than normal and your ability to reach them in six minutes is massively compromised.""The authors say that their study shows that the emergency services are particularly sensitive to the expected impacts of future increases in rainfall. The impacts would be greater with surface flooding events rather than with river or coastal flooding.Preventing unnecessary delays in the future will require planners to identify hotspots of vulnerability and to re-think the distribution of ambulances and fire stations. ""With climate change, flooding will likely become more frequent and more intense,""said Prof Dapeng Yu.""So certainly, when the authorities consider the strategic plan for new ambulance stations or fire stations, they need to consider this factor.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Sustainability.Follow Matt on Twitter.",18 May 2020,science
Social distancing: When extreme weather and coronavirus collide,"People being displaced by extreme weather events around the world are being forced to break Covid-19 social distancing safety guidelines, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and other humanitarian agencies.“Social distancing is no longer possible when displaced people are in evacuation centres,” Marshal Makavure, emergency operations co-ordinator of IFRC in Eastern Africa told the BBC.“People have been forced to break the Covid-19 protocol and guidelines under such circumstances.”The BBC has spoken with people living in areas affected by extreme weather events.Subrat Kumar Padhihary, a 38-year-old farmer in Odisha state on India’s east coast, is worried.Indian officials are on alert as Cyclone Amphan, due to hit West Bengal and Odisha on Wednesday, looks likely to intensify into a ""very severe"" storm.Subrat’s village is nearly 40 kilometres from the sea. The house that he shares with his wife, three daughters and mother was badly damaged by Cyclone Fani last year, so he isn’t convinced it can withstand Cyclone Amphan.But even if his house survives, he’s worried about having to leave his village if the authorities say people must evacuate.Subrat feels that might be even more dangerous.“My fear is that we will be taken to nearby schools that have already been turned into Covid-19 quarantine shelters.“There are not many centres in our village, and that means we will have to share the space with people [who may have Covid-19] which will be full of risks.”“West Bengal state has been struggling with Covid-19 cases and that is a cause of concern when it comes to cyclone preparedness,” according to Siddarth Srinivas, food and climate policy lead for Oxfam in Asia.“In the past, some states in India have rescued people by sheltering them in schools and public buildings, but this time doing that is not ideal because of the pandemic.”The Kasese district in western Uganda has been one of the worst hit by recent floods, with hundreds of people displaced.Joseline Kabugho is six months pregnant. The 23 year old has been forced to shelter with her two children in one of the school-turned-camps in the district.She’s staying at the shelter, even though her pregnancy means she is in a high-risk group when it comes to Covid-19 infection. There are nearly 200 displaced people with her at the shelter.“We are so vulnerable now,” she said from a class shared with three other families, which is now her family’s temporary home. “I can’t stay away from other people because of the limited space.“I am worried that I may get the virus, and I am worried about my kids, and my unborn baby,” she told the BBC.Joseline was sleeping next to her two children on the night of 7 May, when she heard other people in her village screaming.“I realised later on that my neighbours were actually telling me to run for my life. The entire village had been hit by a massive flood.“I grabbed my two kids and ran away, I had no time to take anything else.""She had bought some clothes for her unborn baby before the floods. “I could not even save those clothes. The floods took them all.“Whatever we had was swept away.""Her husband works in another district and he has been unable to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions. “I have nowhere to go and I don’t know what to do next.”Relief workers with the Red Cross say thousands of people are now sheltering in churches and schools in flood-hit East Africa with limited access to water and soap.Hundreds have died and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the floods in more than a half a dozen countries.More than 2,700 Covid-19 deaths and nearly 82,000 confirmed cases have been recorded in Africa, according to John Hopkins University.Among the flood affected countries in East Africa, Somalia has the highest death figure of 55, followed by 50 in Kenya and 21 in Tanzania.Tropical cyclone Harold hit Pacific island countries more than a month ago.Some affected countries had to lift Covid-19 restrictions to allow people to take refuge in evacuation centres. Some people are still in evacuation centres now because the pandemic is affecting aid efforts.The worst-hit country, Vanuatu, has extended the state of emergency as more than 92,000 people have been affected, according to Unicef.In Fiji, about 10 evacuation centres are operating because recovery has been very slow and many houses are yet to be rebuilt.“Access to water is still a big challenge as the cyclone has destroyed water supply infrastructures,” said Vani Catanasiga, director of Fiji Council of Social Services.“Without adequate water supply, following Covid-19 hygiene guidelines is very difficult, although the Fijian government has been successful in flattening the Covid-19 infection curve.”Humanitarian agencies say relief operations can help in enforcing Covid-19 guidelines.Red Cross relief worker Irene Nakasiits is distributing water and soap as essentials to the flood-displaced communities in western Uganda.“Although it is challenging to do so, we can still remind affected communities to follow the guidelines,” according to Marshal Mukuvare of the IFRC.“We can have messages written on food and other relief materials, which we distribute in affected places.“This helps people do what they can, even in such adverse conditions.”It’s uncharted territory, according to Siddarth Srinivas, Food and Climate policy lead for Oxfam in Asia. “When it comes to how to deal with extreme weather and a pandemic like Covid-19, the debate has just started.“It needs much more thinking before we come up with solid measures.”  ",20 May 2020,science
Space Plane: Mysterious US military aircraft launches,"The US Air Force has successfully launched its Atlas V rocket, carrying a X-37B space plane for a secretive mission.The rocket launched on Sunday from Cape Canaveral, a day after bad weather halted plans for a Saturday launch. The aircraft, also known as an Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), will deploy a satellite into orbit and also test power-beaming technology.It is the plane's sixth mission in space. The launch was dedicated to front line workers and those affected by the pandemic. A message including the words ""America Strong"" was written on the rocket's payload fairing. X-37B is a classified programme and United Launch Alliance, which operates the Atlas rocket, was required to end its webcast earlier in the flight than it would normally do.The Pentagon has revealed very few details about the reusable vehicle's missions and capabilities in the past, but Secretary of the Air Force, Barbara Barrett, said earlier this month: ""This X-37B mission will host more experiments than any other prior mission.""It's known that one of the onboard experiments will test the effect of radiation on seeds and other materials. The X-37B programme started in 1999. The vehicle (the project has two) resembles a smaller version of the crewed space shuttles that were retired by the US space programme in 2011. It can glide back down through the atmosphere to land on a runway, just as the shuttle did. Built by Boeing, the plane uses solar panels for power in orbit, measures over 29ft (9m) long, has a wingspan of nearly 15ft and a weight of 11,000lbs (5,000kg).The first plane flew in April 2010 and returned after an eight-month mission. The most recent mission ended in October 2019, after 780 days in orbit, bringing the X-37B programme's time in space to more than seven years.The length of this latest mission is currently unclear.

Meet the baby orangutans learning to climb trees,"While much of the world is in lockdown, youngsters in one very unusual classroom are still having lessons.At a forest school in Borneo, baby orangutans learn tree-climbing skills from their human surrogate parents.The orphans spend 12 hours a day in the forest, preparing for a new life in the wild.The orangutans were filmed and photographed before coronavirus struck, for the TV series Primates, on BBC One.With human contact routinely kept to a minimum, life goes on much as before for the animals, says Dr Signe Preuschoft, leader of ape programmes for the charity Four Paws, which runs the rehabilitation centre in East Kalimantan.As a precaution, the staff now have temperature checks, wear facemasks and change into uniforms on site.The pandemic has disrupted many conservation programmes around the world but Dr Preuschoft says it also offers an opportunity to bring positive change.""There are great opportunities here to protect wildlife better from illegal wildlife trade and from (consumption of) bushmeat,"" she says. ""It's very much about education.""The young orphaned apes climb high into the treetops with their caregivers to help them acquire the skills they would have learned from their mothers in the wild.They would otherwise spend more time on the ground than is natural for a species that feeds, lives and sleeps in the canopies of trees.Baby orangutans have a huge advantage when it comes to climbing, as they can hold on ""like an octopus"", says Dr Preuschoft.""I think the orangutans were really completely thrilled when they realised that they could actually be in a canopy together with one of their moms,"" she adds. As soon as the rescued orangutans have moved out of quarantine, they spend long hours in the forest in as natural an environment as possible. They are taught essential forest survival skills in a large forested area between the cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda.The aim is to provide sanctuary to illegally captured or directly threatened orangutans, as well as to rehabilitate orphaned orangutans, with the goal of releasing them back into the wild. Only about 50,000 Bornean orangutans are left in the world, with numbers plummeting over the last 70 years. Loss of rainforest to oil palm plantations or coal mining leads orangutans into conflict with humans. Orphans are snatched from their dead mothers and are sold or held illegally as pets. The third and last episode of Primates airs this Sunday at 20.15 BST on BBC One and on BBC iPlayer.Follow Helen on Twitter.",17 May 2020,science
Mars: Mud flows on Red Planet behave like 'boiling toothpaste',"Scientists have made a surprising discovery about Mars by playing with muck in the laboratory. An international team of researchers wondered how volcanoes that spew mud instead of molten rock might look on the Red Planet compared with their counterparts here on Earth. In chamber experiments, simulated Martian mud flows were seen to behave a bit like boiling toothpaste. Under certain conditions, the fluid even began to bounce.The mucky gunge resembled a certain type of lava referred to as ""pahoehoe"", which is observed at Hawaii's famous Kīlauea volcano.The research results could now complicate some investigations at the Red Planet, believes study lead Dr Petr Brož from the Czech Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geophysics.""You'll look at some features [from space] and you won't know for sure whether they are the result of lava flows or mud flows.""Without a geologist on the ground to hit them with a hammer, it will be hard to tell,"" he told BBC News.For a long time, Dr Brož had a sceptical view about mud volcanoes on Mars. The phenomena are well known here on Earth, but he'd actually spent several years trying to disprove an interpretation that large numbers of conical forms on the Red Planet might also be the same thing.Eventually, he came around to the idea, and that led him to wonder how mud - if it really does spew from the ground on Mars - would behave in the extreme cold and low-pressure conditions that persist there. This took him to Dr Manish Patel and his team at the UK's Open University. They have a special chamber that can recreate the Martian environment.It's the kind of set-up in which equipment destined to go on a space agency rover would be tested.  And although ordinarily every effort would be made to keep the chamber spotlessly clean, the researchers soon found themselves tipping experimental muddy fluids down a sandy slope.Under ""Earth conditions"", these muddy mixes behave as you would expect: they're smooth, like gravy poured on to a dinner plate. But under ""Martian conditions"", the mud progresses via a series of ropy and jagged lobes.It all comes down to how the low atmospheric pressure - less than 1% of the Earth's value - makes water rapidly evaporate, boil and ultimately freeze.""The skin on the fluid freezes, but this flow is thick enough that the inside remains fluid,"" explained Dr Patel. ""So the skin will stop the flow for a bit, but then the momentum from the fluid inside breaks through at weak points in the skin, and the flow propagates forward. It's just like pahoehoe, except that's molten rock. But again, it's a cooling skin that forms before hot material bursts through.""The team reports its initial experiments in a paper in the journal Nature Geoscience. Not captured in this publication are subsequent experiments in which the flows were repeated for a ""hot day"" on Mars. There are places where it can get as high as 20C for  short periods. In this scenario, the mud boiled vigorously in the low pressure; ""it was jumping over the surface as if levitating,"" said Dr Brož.The team's work should be a reminder to scientists that when they look at planetary bodies, physical processes can sometimes produce unexpected outcomes, he added.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",18 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX crew mission cleared to launch,"Key officials at the American space agency (Nasa) and private launch firm SpaceX have signed off next week's historic mission to the space station.Astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken will ride to orbit from Florida - the first time in nine years that humans have left Earth from US territory.A review panel has found no technical reason to delay the mission.SpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket with its Dragon capsule is set to lift off at 16:33 EDT (21:33 BST) on Wednesday.The decision of the Flight Readiness Review (FRR) panel opens the way for final launch preparations to proceed.""We did a thorough review of all the systems and all the risks, and it was unanimous on the board that we are 'go for launch',"" said Stephen Jurczyk, Nasa's associate administrator, who chaired the FRR.Already, the Falcon has been rolled out to the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A, and lifted into the vertical.The transfer on Thursday allowed SpaceX engineers to conduct a static fire on Friday. This saw the vehicle ignite briefly all nine of its engines to confirm their operational status.Clamps held the booster to prevent it moving in the test.Another important pre-launch moment occurs on Saturday with the ""Crew Dry Dress"". This involves Hurley and Behnken getting into their spacesuits and rehearsing all the actions they must take next Wednesday, including strapping themselves into the Dragon capsule. The attention to detail is all about making this mission as safe as possible.""Our teams are scouring and thinking of every single risk that's out there, and we've worked our butt off to buy down the ones we know of. And we'll continue to look and continue to buy them down until we bring [Hurley and Behnken] home,"" said Kathy Lueders, who manages Nasa's Commercial Crew Program. There is huge focus on this mission. Not since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011 has America been able to launch its own astronauts to the space station - a task that has rested solely with Russia and its Soyuz rocket and capsule system.Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, initiated just prior to the end days of the famous winged orbiters, sought to incentivise a new human transportation industry in the US.The agency proposed to purchase launch services off private companies and gave them seed money to help develop their hardware.SpaceX, run by the tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, is the first of the commercial operators to deliver a working system. The aerospace giant Boeing is some way behind in its progress, but should eventually match the SpaceX milestones.For Nasa, this approach of contracting out astronaut transportation to low-Earth orbit has saved it many billions of dollars. The old way of doing things, which required the agency to purchase, own and operate its space vehicles, proved to be very expensive.From now on, Nasa will simply buy seats in what are essentially private taxi services. Cash that's freed up can then be diverted to more complex endeavours such as preparing to take astronauts back to the Moon and on to Mars.   ""It's been estimated that this programme overall will have saved Nasa maybe $30bn-40bn at least,"" observed Benji Reed, director of crew mission management at SpaceX.  ""Firm, fixed-price contracts and the kind of truly open partnership where we work together allows that kind of saving to happen and that kind of ability to allow Nasa to invest in more things and do other programmes.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",22 May 2020,science
