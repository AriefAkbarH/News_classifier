Climate change: Top 10 tips to reduce carbon footprint revealed,"Climate change can still be tackled – but only if people are willing to embrace major shifts in the way we live, a report says.The authors have put together a list of the best ways for people to reduce their carbon footprints.The response to the Covid-19 crisis has shown that the public is willing to accept radical change if they consider it necessary, they explain.And the report adds that government priorities must be re-ordered.Protecting the planet must become the first duty of all decision-makers, the researchers argue.The authors urge the public to contribute by adopting the carbon-cutting measures in the report, which is based on an analysis of 7,000 other studies.Top of the list is living car-free, which saves an average of 2.04 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually. This is followed by driving a battery electric car - 1.95 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually - and taking one less long-haul flight each year - 1.68 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person.Switching to a vegan diet will help - but less than tackling transport, the research shows.It says popular activities such as recycling are worthwhile, but don’t cut emissions by as much.The lead author, Dr Diana Ivanova from Leeds University, told BBC News: “We need a complete change of mindset. “We have to agree how much carbon we can each emit within the limits of what the planet can bear – then make good lives within those boundaries.“The top 10 options are available to us now, without the need for controversial and expensive new technologies.” Dr Ivanova said the coronavirus lockdown has shown that many people could live without cars if public transport, walking and cycling were improved.Her research highlights rich people who typically take more flights, drive bigger cars and consume the most. She said: “All the world suffers from climate change, but it’s not the average person who flies regularly – it’s a small group, yet aviation is under-taxed. It’s a moral issue.”In her league table, buying renewable power and using public transport rank fourth and fifth.Sixth is insulating your home well, which saves 0.895 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.Seventh is switching to a vegan diet, which saves 0.8 tonnes. Other top actions are using heat pumps; switching from polluting cookstoves (in developing countries) to better methods of cooking, and heating buildings with renewable energy. Dr Ivanova said that if people implemented the measures, it would save around nine tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per person per year.Current annual household emissions are around 10 tonnes in the UK, and 17 in the US.The study, out soon in the journal Environmental Research Letters, says the following are worthwhile, but of lesser benefit to the climate: green roofs; using less paper; buying more durable items; turning down the thermostat - and recycling, which saves 0.01 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to Dr Ivanova.Some of the findings will be questioned. Polls suggest some people think climate is as important as the virus, for instance, but some don’t.Professor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “This is a valuable study. But it only looks at the carbon footprint and not at other impacts like water scarcity because of lithium mining for electric car batteries.Libby Peake, from the Green Alliance think tank, told BBC News: “People shouldn’t stop good habits like recycling, which saves some carbon while preventing waste and conserving resources.”  “Better design allows people to buy fewer but higher-quality things and to live in buildings with lower carbon footprints.

Climate change: Scientists fear car surge will see CO2 rebound,"Daily global emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to Covid-19, say scientists.The most comprehensive account yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys. But the authors are worried that, as people return to work, car use will soar again.They fear CO2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis.They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real, durable changes on transport and personal mobility.In the UK, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged £250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure. Other countries are also looking at similar plans.The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to Covid-19 have had a significant impact on the carbon-producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do.Road transport has declined hugely, as has aviation. However, now that the UK is beginning to return to work, Mr Shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport, should walking or cycling not be an option.""If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than travelling by bus, train or tram,"" he said.Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed. Now in detailed analysis, researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of CO2.They've calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97% of global emissions.During the peak of the crisis in early April, daily emissions dropped by 17% compared to the previous year, meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day.The key to the fall has been cars. Surface transport emissions have declined by 43%, the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined. While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact, it only accounts for 10% of the decrease during the pandemic. China has been responsible for the biggest drop, followed by the US, Europe and India.If some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year, then global emissions will likely drop by 7%. If pre-pandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by mid-June, the annual fall would be around 4%. But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound, especially on the roads, could see a carbon surge.Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants, too. One of the UK's leading experts, Prof Frank Kelly, from King's College London, said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two years before US authorities exposed the scandal.He told Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road.Prof Kelly said he reported it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they didn't publish his findings. He said work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal action against car makers that had installed ""defeat devices"" to fool regulators.The government didn't deny the account. A spokesperson said: ""We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the World Health Organization as an 'example for the rest of the world to follow'"".Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 crisis, he said levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60% in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown.Levels of another pollutant, sooty particles, remained at harmful concentrations.""A big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work, and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before, once everybody goes back,"" said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia, who led the analysis.The researchers say that fundamental, systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change. When it comes to transportation, there are huge opportunities, according to Prof Le Quéré. She says that after the global financial crisis in 2008, some governments like China, US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables. ""Here now in 2020 we're very close to the same situation in electric mobility,"" she told BBC News.""Battery prices have come down, we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies.""""So if these two things can align, then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow.""Grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change. A letter signed by 155 major companies, representing $2.4 trillion (£1.96 trillion) in market capitalisation, calls for a net-zero emissions response to the covid crisis. Corporations including Carlsberg, Iberdrola, EDF and Coca Cola Europe say they want governments to ""prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy"".The authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action. They point to the fact that while emissions of CO2 may be temporarily reduced, all the while CO2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet.It will take a a dramatic shift to change that. ""I think very much that we are at a crossroads. And at this point, like the UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, it could go either way.""""He was talking about his own health, but here we're talking about the health of the planet.""""It could go either way.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Follow Matt on Twitter.",19 May 2020,science
Mars: Mud flows on Red Planet behave like 'boiling toothpaste',"Scientists have made a surprising discovery about Mars by playing with muck in the laboratory. An international team of researchers wondered how volcanoes that spew mud instead of molten rock might look on the Red Planet compared with their counterparts here on Earth. In chamber experiments, simulated Martian mud flows were seen to behave a bit like boiling toothpaste. Under certain conditions, the fluid even began to bounce.The mucky gunge resembled a certain type of lava referred to as ""pahoehoe"", which is observed at Hawaii's famous Kīlauea volcano.The research results could now complicate some investigations at the Red Planet, believes study lead Dr Petr Brož from the Czech Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geophysics.""You'll look at some features [from space] and you won't know for sure whether they are the result of lava flows or mud flows.""Without a geologist on the ground to hit them with a hammer, it will be hard to tell,"" he told BBC News.For a long time, Dr Brož had a sceptical view about mud volcanoes on Mars. The phenomena are well known here on Earth, but he'd actually spent several years trying to disprove an interpretation that large numbers of conical forms on the Red Planet might also be the same thing.Eventually, he came around to the idea, and that led him to wonder how mud - if it really does spew from the ground on Mars - would behave in the extreme cold and low-pressure conditions that persist there. This took him to Dr Manish Patel and his team at the UK's Open University. They have a special chamber that can recreate the Martian environment.It's the kind of set-up in which equipment destined to go on a space agency rover would be tested.  And although ordinarily every effort would be made to keep the chamber spotlessly clean, the researchers soon found themselves tipping experimental muddy fluids down a sandy slope.Under ""Earth conditions"", these muddy mixes behave as you would expect: they're smooth, like gravy poured on to a dinner plate. But under ""Martian conditions"", the mud progresses via a series of ropy and jagged lobes.It all comes down to how the low atmospheric pressure - less than 1% of the Earth's value - makes water rapidly evaporate, boil and ultimately freeze.""The skin on the fluid freezes, but this flow is thick enough that the inside remains fluid,"" explained Dr Patel. ""So the skin will stop the flow for a bit, but then the momentum from the fluid inside breaks through at weak points in the skin, and the flow propagates forward. It's just like pahoehoe, except that's molten rock. But again, it's a cooling skin that forms before hot material bursts through.""The team reports its initial experiments in a paper in the journal Nature Geoscience. Not captured in this publication are subsequent experiments in which the flows were repeated for a ""hot day"" on Mars. There are places where it can get as high as 20C for  short periods. In this scenario, the mud boiled vigorously in the low pressure; ""it was jumping over the surface as if levitating,"" said Dr Brož.The team's work should be a reminder to scientists that when they look at planetary bodies, physical processes can sometimes produce unexpected outcomes, he added.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",18 May 2020,science
Climate change: Future floods will delay emergency response,"Future increases in rainfall in England could significantly impact emergency responses, according to a new study.Researchers say that flood conditions could see just 9% of some rural populations reached by an ambulance within the 7-15 minute mandatory timeframe.Older people living in rural areas would be worst affected, the authors say.They say there should be a rethink on ambulance locations in flooding events.Flooding is one of the most devastating impacts of climate change. According to studies, it is likely to increase in the future. The Met Office has indicated that an extended period of extreme rainfall in winter, similar to what was seen in parts of England between 2013 and 2014 is now about seven times more likely because of human-induced climate change. To find out how this changing rainfall might impact on ambulance and fire and rescue services, researchers projected the impacts of floods that might occur once in 30 years, once in 100 years and once in 1,000 years.In England, emergency responders must reach urgent cases within mandatory timeframes, regardless of the weather conditions. In normal conditions, around 84% of England's population can be reached by ambulance in around seven minutes. The researchers found that when a once in 30-year flood event struck, this dropped to 67%. With a once in a 100-year flood, just over half the population would be reachable in seven minutes, while in a once in a 1,000-year flood, only 27% of the total population would see an ambulance inside that time limit.Different locations had different outcomes according to the study. East Riding and Berkshire would see their coverage reduce to 9% and 12% respectively. ""Even the small magnitude floods affect the emergency response,"" said lead author Prof Dapeng Yu from Loughborough University.""Ambulance services have been centralised in recent decades, so in villages or small towns there's no ambulance service, therefore when an incident happens in rural areas, it takes a lot longer for them to reach.""As well as rural areas, large urban centres including London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Newcastle, would also see a reduction in response time under a 30-year flood.Care homes, sheltered accommodation, nurseries and schools would be among the most vulnerable locations with older people in rural areas likely worst-hit, according to the study. The authors say that the day of the Brexit referendum on 23 June in 2016 is a good example of what can happen to the emergency services during surface flooding events. Referendum day was memorable for large-scale surface flooding in many parts of London after torrential rain.Around 450 flooding incidents were attended by the London Fire and Rescue Service, which was three times the number from the previous day.The London fire service target timeframe for reaching incidents is six minutes and on June 23, 59% of journeys were outside that target. ""You don't know when it's going to hit and you don't know how hard it is going to hit,"" said Prof Dapeng Yu.""But when it happens, like in London during the referendum day, it is really striking.""""It really shows the impacts, you will receive three times more calls than normal and your ability to reach them in six minutes is massively compromised.""The authors say that their study shows that the emergency services are particularly sensitive to the expected impacts of future increases in rainfall. The impacts would be greater with surface flooding events rather than with river or coastal flooding.Preventing unnecessary delays in the future will require planners to identify hotspots of vulnerability and to re-think the distribution of ambulances and fire stations. ""With climate change, flooding will likely become more frequent and more intense,""said Prof Dapeng Yu.""So certainly, when the authorities consider the strategic plan for new ambulance stations or fire stations, they need to consider this factor.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Sustainability.Follow Matt on Twitter.",18 May 2020,science
Project seeks super view of Earth's mantle,"Some of the most sophisticated models of the Earth's interior ever constructed will be produced in a new project led from Cardiff University. Researchers want to simulate the behaviour of the mantle.This solid rock layer, which resides between the planet's core and crust, moves very slowly over time - roughly at the speed that a fingernail grows.The scientists will investigate its complex pattern of upwellings and downwellings.The team hopes its new circulation models will provide fresh insights into how the mantle has influenced the Earth's surface over hundreds of millions of years.""In the same way that the study of DNA has given us a whole new framework to understand biology, evolution and even this coronavirus we now face - so I want to look to the interior of the Earth to better understand how our planet, our single and sole 'spaceship', really works,"" project leader Prof Huw Davies told BBC News.Everyone is now familiar with plate tectonics - the description of how the rigid outer shell of our planet (its lithosphere) moves and is recycled.Great strides have been made in developing this theory in the 50 years since it came to prominence.For example, early ideas suggested the plates simply rode convection cells in the mantle like groceries on a supermarket check-out belt.   But we can now see that it's actually the weight of the ocean plates where they underthrust the continents that plays the major role in driving this remarkable system.Cold, dense rock at plate margins pulls on everything behind as it sinks into the mantle. And like the slinky dog that's started its journey downstairs, it needs little encouragement to maintain the momentum.Nonetheless, what goes down is coming back up because the heat of the interior has to be managed and redistributed.The new project will focus on the where and how of the upwellings, mapping the different regions of temperature, density, and velocity. Its supercomputer simulations will be constrained by state of the art knowledge in rock physics, chemistry and magnetism. Thanks to seismology, the study of how waves of energy from quakes move through the Earth, we have a very good picture of what the planet's interior looks like today. And the team's models, when they're run forwards and backwards, will have to reproduce this anchoring snapshot.The goal, says Prof Davies, is to get an accurate representation of behaviour back to about one billion years into the past.A key target is to understand the upwellings that ultimately result in ""hotspots"" at the Earth's surface - the places where there have been colossal outpourings of lava and gas through geologic history.""These are what we call the Large Igneous Provinces, or LIPs,"" explained Prof Davies. ""There hasn't been anything like this since the Columbia River flood basalts in North America just over 10 million years ago. So, they're rare. And thank goodness, because they can be absolutely catastrophic. ""The Siberian Traps which cover a large part of west Siberia match up with the largest extinction on Earth. A lot of the great extinction events are linked to these LIPs.""The £3m project is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and will run for four years.Prof Davies' team has members from the universities of Bristol, Cambridge, Oxford, Leeds, Liverpool, Imperial College London, Royal Holloway University of London, and University College London - in addition to Cardiff.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",18 May 2020,science

Climate change: Future floods will delay emergency response,"Future increases in rainfall in England could significantly impact emergency responses, according to a new study.Researchers say that flood conditions could see just 9% of some rural populations reached by an ambulance within the 7-15 minute mandatory timeframe.Older people living in rural areas would be worst affected, the authors say.They say there should be a rethink on ambulance locations in flooding events.Flooding is one of the most devastating impacts of climate change. According to studies, it is likely to increase in the future. The Met Office has indicated that an extended period of extreme rainfall in winter, similar to what was seen in parts of England between 2013 and 2014 is now about seven times more likely because of human-induced climate change. To find out how this changing rainfall might impact on ambulance and fire and rescue services, researchers projected the impacts of floods that might occur once in 30 years, once in 100 years and once in 1,000 years.In England, emergency responders must reach urgent cases within mandatory timeframes, regardless of the weather conditions. In normal conditions, around 84% of England's population can be reached by ambulance in around seven minutes. The researchers found that when a once in 30-year flood event struck, this dropped to 67%. With a once in a 100-year flood, just over half the population would be reachable in seven minutes, while in a once in a 1,000-year flood, only 27% of the total population would see an ambulance inside that time limit.Different locations had different outcomes according to the study. East Riding and Berkshire would see their coverage reduce to 9% and 12% respectively. ""Even the small magnitude floods affect the emergency response,"" said lead author Prof Dapeng Yu from Loughborough University.""Ambulance services have been centralised in recent decades, so in villages or small towns there's no ambulance service, therefore when an incident happens in rural areas, it takes a lot longer for them to reach.""As well as rural areas, large urban centres including London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Newcastle, would also see a reduction in response time under a 30-year flood.Care homes, sheltered accommodation, nurseries and schools would be among the most vulnerable locations with older people in rural areas likely worst-hit, according to the study. The authors say that the day of the Brexit referendum on 23 June in 2016 is a good example of what can happen to the emergency services during surface flooding events. Referendum day was memorable for large-scale surface flooding in many parts of London after torrential rain.Around 450 flooding incidents were attended by the London Fire and Rescue Service, which was three times the number from the previous day.The London fire service target timeframe for reaching incidents is six minutes and on June 23, 59% of journeys were outside that target. ""You don't know when it's going to hit and you don't know how hard it is going to hit,"" said Prof Dapeng Yu.""But when it happens, like in London during the referendum day, it is really striking.""""It really shows the impacts, you will receive three times more calls than normal and your ability to reach them in six minutes is massively compromised.""The authors say that their study shows that the emergency services are particularly sensitive to the expected impacts of future increases in rainfall. The impacts would be greater with surface flooding events rather than with river or coastal flooding.Preventing unnecessary delays in the future will require planners to identify hotspots of vulnerability and to re-think the distribution of ambulances and fire stations. ""With climate change, flooding will likely become more frequent and more intense,""said Prof Dapeng Yu.""So certainly, when the authorities consider the strategic plan for new ambulance stations or fire stations, they need to consider this factor.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Sustainability.Follow Matt on Twitter.",18 May 2020,science
Project seeks super view of Earth's mantle,"Some of the most sophisticated models of the Earth's interior ever constructed will be produced in a new project led from Cardiff University. Researchers want to simulate the behaviour of the mantle.This solid rock layer, which resides between the planet's core and crust, moves very slowly over time - roughly at the speed that a fingernail grows.The scientists will investigate its complex pattern of upwellings and downwellings.The team hopes its new circulation models will provide fresh insights into how the mantle has influenced the Earth's surface over hundreds of millions of years.""In the same way that the study of DNA has given us a whole new framework to understand biology, evolution and even this coronavirus we now face - so I want to look to the interior of the Earth to better understand how our planet, our single and sole 'spaceship', really works,"" project leader Prof Huw Davies told BBC News.Everyone is now familiar with plate tectonics - the description of how the rigid outer shell of our planet (its lithosphere) moves and is recycled.Great strides have been made in developing this theory in the 50 years since it came to prominence.For example, early ideas suggested the plates simply rode convection cells in the mantle like groceries on a supermarket check-out belt.   But we can now see that it's actually the weight of the ocean plates where they underthrust the continents that plays the major role in driving this remarkable system.Cold, dense rock at plate margins pulls on everything behind as it sinks into the mantle. And like the slinky dog that's started its journey downstairs, it needs little encouragement to maintain the momentum.Nonetheless, what goes down is coming back up because the heat of the interior has to be managed and redistributed.The new project will focus on the where and how of the upwellings, mapping the different regions of temperature, density, and velocity. Its supercomputer simulations will be constrained by state of the art knowledge in rock physics, chemistry and magnetism. Thanks to seismology, the study of how waves of energy from quakes move through the Earth, we have a very good picture of what the planet's interior looks like today. And the team's models, when they're run forwards and backwards, will have to reproduce this anchoring snapshot.The goal, says Prof Davies, is to get an accurate representation of behaviour back to about one billion years into the past.A key target is to understand the upwellings that ultimately result in ""hotspots"" at the Earth's surface - the places where there have been colossal outpourings of lava and gas through geologic history.""These are what we call the Large Igneous Provinces, or LIPs,"" explained Prof Davies. ""There hasn't been anything like this since the Columbia River flood basalts in North America just over 10 million years ago. So, they're rare.

Climate change: Scientists fear car surge will see CO2 rebound,"Daily global emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to Covid-19, say scientists.The most comprehensive account yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys. But the authors are worried that, as people return to work, car use will soar again.They fear CO2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis.They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real, durable changes on transport and personal mobility.In the UK, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged £250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure. Other countries are also looking at similar plans.The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to Covid-19 have had a significant impact on the carbon-producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do.Road transport has declined hugely, as has aviation. However, now that the UK is beginning to return to work, Mr Shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport, should walking or cycling not be an option.""If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than travelling by bus, train or tram,"" he said.Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed. Now in detailed analysis, researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of CO2.They've calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97% of global emissions.During the peak of the crisis in early April, daily emissions dropped by 17% compared to the previous year, meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day.The key to the fall has been cars. Surface transport emissions have declined by 43%, the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined. While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact, it only accounts for 10% of the decrease during the pandemic. China has been responsible for the biggest drop, followed by the US, Europe and India.If some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year, then global emissions will likely drop by 7%. If pre-pandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by mid-June, the annual fall would be around 4%. But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound, especially on the roads, could see a carbon surge.Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants, too. One of the UK's leading experts, Prof Frank Kelly, from King's College London, said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two years before US authorities exposed the scandal.He told Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road.Prof Kelly said he reported it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they didn't publish his findings. He said work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal action against car makers that had installed ""defeat devices"" to fool regulators.The government didn't deny the account. A spokesperson said: ""We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the World Health Organization as an 'example for the rest of the world to follow'"".Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 crisis, he said levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60% in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown.Levels of another pollutant, sooty particles, remained at harmful concentrations.""A big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work, and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before, once everybody goes back,"" said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia, who led the analysis.The researchers say that fundamental, systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change. When it comes to transportation, there are huge opportunities, according to Prof Le Quéré. She says that after the global financial crisis in 2008, some governments like China, US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables. ""Here now in 2020 we're very close to the same situation in electric mobility,"" she told BBC News.""Battery prices have come down, we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies.""""So if these two things can align, then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow.""Grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change. A letter signed by 155 major companies, representing $2.4 trillion (£1.96 trillion) in market capitalisation, calls for a net-zero emissions response to the covid crisis. Corporations including Carlsberg, Iberdrola, EDF and Coca Cola Europe say they want governments to ""prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy"".The authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action. They point to the fact that while emissions of CO2 may be temporarily reduced, all the while CO2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet.It will take a a dramatic shift to change that. ""I think very much that we are at a crossroads. And at this point, like the UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, it could go either way.""""He was talking about his own health, but here we're talking about the health of the planet.""""It could go either way.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Follow Matt on Twitter.",19 May 2020,science
Mars: Mud flows on Red Planet behave like 'boiling toothpaste',"Scientists have made a surprising discovery about Mars by playing with muck in the laboratory. An international team of researchers wondered how volcanoes that spew mud instead of molten rock might look on the Red Planet compared with their counterparts here on Earth. In chamber experiments, simulated Martian mud flows were seen to behave a bit like boiling toothpaste. Under certain conditions, the fluid even began to bounce.The mucky gunge resembled a certain type of lava referred to as ""pahoehoe"", which is observed at Hawaii's famous Kīlauea volcano.The research results could now complicate some investigations at the Red Planet, believes study lead Dr Petr Brož from the Czech Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geophysics.""You'll look at some features [from space] and you won't know for sure whether they are the result of lava flows or mud flows.""Without a geologist on the ground to hit them with a hammer, it will be hard to tell,"" he told BBC News.For a long time, Dr Brož had a sceptical view about mud volcanoes on Mars. The phenomena are well known here on Earth, but he'd actually spent several years trying to disprove an interpretation that large numbers of conical forms on the Red Planet might also be the same thing.Eventually, he came around to the idea, and that led him to wonder how mud - if it really does spew from the ground on Mars - would behave in the extreme cold and low-pressure conditions that persist there. This took him to Dr Manish Patel and his team at the UK's Open University. They have a special chamber that can recreate the Martian environment.It's the kind of set-up in which equipment destined to go on a space agency rover would be tested.  And although ordinarily every effort would be made to keep the chamber spotlessly clean, the researchers soon found themselves tipping experimental muddy fluids down a sandy slope.Under ""Earth conditions"", these muddy mixes behave as you would expect: they're smooth, like gravy poured on to a dinner plate. But under ""Martian conditions"", the mud progresses via a series of ropy and jagged lobes.It all comes down to how the low atmospheric pressure - less than 1% of the Earth's value - makes water rapidly evaporate, boil and ultimately freeze.""The skin on the fluid freezes, but this flow is thick enough that the inside remains fluid,"" explained Dr Patel. ""So the skin will stop the flow for a bit, but then the momentum from the fluid inside breaks through at weak points in the skin, and the flow propagates forward. It's just like pahoehoe, except that's molten rock. But again, it's a cooling skin that forms before hot material bursts through.""The team reports its initial experiments in a paper in the journal Nature Geoscience. Not captured in this publication are subsequent experiments in which the flows were repeated for a ""hot day"" on Mars. There are places where it can get as high as 20C for  short periods.

How coronavirus is driving a revolution in travel,"Barriers closed a stretch of Deansgate, Manchester's main thoroughfare, to motor vehicles on Saturday.Elsewhere in the city, new pedestrian walkways and pop-up bike lanes have appeared. It is part of a nationwide effort to create more space for social distancing as the country gradually begins to lift the coronavirus restrictions.Glasgow, Leicester, York and Brighton have also created new space for walking or cycling this week.And dozens more UK towns and cities plan to do so.On Friday, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he would be shutting some of the busiest roads in the city.He said his plan to close large swathes of London to cars and vans would create one of the largest car-free areas of any city in the world.""Many Londoners have rediscovered the joys of walking and cycling during lockdown"", Mr Khan said.  ""By quickly and cheaply widening pavements, creating temporary cycle lanes and closing roads to through traffic we will enable millions more people to change the way they get around our city.""He acknowledged that the changes would cause disruption for many Londoners but said he had no choice but to rapidly repurpose London's streets for people.""By ensuring our city's recovery is green, we will also tackle our toxic air, which is vital to make sure we don't replace one public health crisis with another.""Most of the changes being brought in around the country are a temporary response to the coronavirus crisis, but many local authorities say that - following consultation with local communities - they would like to make them permanent. ""We hope that pedestrians and cyclists will reclaim the streets of this city"", councillor Angeliki Stogia, Manchester's lead member for Transport and Environment, told the BBC.  The coronavirus crisis has allowed many projects to be fast-tracked.""Some of the projects Manchester is introducing have been in the planning process for years,"" she said.The government has acknowledged that resolving how we can travel while maintaining social distancing is one of the biggest challenges it faces as it starts to lift the lockdown.The current message is: don't use public transport if you can avoid it, yet if people take to their cars, our streets will be choked with traffic.Last week, the government announced what it called a ""once in a generation"" investment to change the way Britain gets around.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps ordered English local authorities to make ""significant changes"" to give more space to pedestrians and cyclists.He said he would be setting up a £250 million emergency fund to encourage what he called ""active travel"".Mr Shapps said the money was the first instalment of a £2bn package for cycling and walking, part of a £5bn investment announced in February.Councils can already use temporary traffic orders to widen pavements, install cycle lanes, create new zebra crossings and close entire streets to traffic, and Mr Shapps has said he will enhance their powers.It means local authorities have the ability to completely alter the way traffic moves through a town or city.But most of the new measures involve restricting car and other motor vehicle access.Some motorists see what is happening as a land grab, conducted under the cover of covid and designed to create ""new facts on the ground"".""What is worrying about this is that it feels anti-motorist, anti-cars, anti-lorries, anti-vans"", says Rod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association.  ""All those methods of transport are essential for economic recovery, so don't punish one group at the expense of the other"", he urges.Manchester has dubbed its campaign to encourage walking and cycling ""Safe Streets Save Lives"".The city says it will use £5m of emergency funding to introduce changes where they are most needed, so outside shops, transport hubs or on routes to hospitals.The aim is that these initiatives will help achieve the authority's goal of making the city carbon-neutral by 2038 as well as creating a healthier, more pleasant city.The focus is not just on the city centre.Levenshulme in south-east Manchester will see some of the most dramatic traffic calming measures in the entire region.The plan is that 30 traffic filters made of heavy concrete flower pots and bollards will close much of the neighbourhood to through traffic over the next few weeks.""We have consulted with the community and they say want to make this area a nicer place to live"", says Levenshulme resident Pauline Johnson. She said the response from local people has been overwhelmingly positive.""They say they want this to be somewhere where children can play safely in the streets.""Greater Manchester's cycling commissioner Chris Boardman, says cycling has increased by more than 70% on some days since the lockdown in the region.""What coronavirus has shown is that if you give people safe, traffic free streets they will walk more and ride bikes"", he told the BBC.""If we don't take steps to enable people to keep traveling actively, we risk a huge spike in car use as measures are eased"", the Olympic gold winner said.""Not only is it the right thing to do to protect people now, but it's vital to meet our clean air goals and protect our NHS long-term.""Lockdown has certainly prompted a boom in bike sales. At one point this week shares in Halfords, the country's biggest chain of cycle shops, had jumped 17%.The company said sales of some cycling equipment had risen 500% since the government ordered us all to stay at home on March 23rd.Ken Foster says his bike shop, Foster's Cycles, in the Manchester suburb of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, is the busiest it has been since his grandfather opened it back in 1954.But it has been exceptionally good weather.  What happens when it rains?""There is no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing"", says Ken Foster with a laugh.Follow Justin on Twitter.",16 May 2020,science
Ozone layer: Concern grows over threat from replacement chemicals,"Substances used for air conditioning in almost all new cars are building up in the environment and may pose a threat to human health, researchers say.These ""ozone friendly"" chemicals have been introduced to replace products that were damaging the ozone layer.Now widely used across industry, these alternatives do not break down in the environment.Scientists have now found increasing levels of these chemicals in Arctic ice samples dating back to the 1990s. The Montreal Protocol is regarded as one of the most successful environmental treaties ever adopted.Signed back in 1987, it committed countries to regulate their use of chlorofluorocarbon chemicals (CFCs) that had recently been found to be depleting the ozone layer. A growing hole in the ozone over Antarctica had been detected in the mid-1980s and there was serious concern about the threat it posed to human health.CFCs were then widely used in refrigeration, in air conditioning, as solvents and in aerosol sprays.In the intervening decades, alternative products that are less harmful to the ozone layer were introduced. As a result, researchers have reported progress in reducing the size of the hole.However, there are now concerns that the solution may be inadvertently damaging the environment and threatening human health.Canadian researchers, studying ice samples from the Arctic dating back to the 1990s, have found ""dramatically"" increasing levels of ozone replacements called short chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (scPFCAs).""We're seeing much, much larger levels, on the order of 10 times higher now than we saw before the Montreal Protocol,"" said Prof Cora Young, from York University in Toronto, the study's corresponding author.""We don't know a lot about them and their potential toxicity, but we do know that we are committing the environment to a great deal of contamination.""The compounds being detected in the Arctic are in the same class as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, sometimes called the ""forever chemicals"".These long-lasting chemicals are found in everything, from furniture to clothing to food wrapping to drinking water. There is growing concern about the role of PFAS in serious health conditions including cancer, liver damage and decreased fertility.The related products, found in the Arctic ice samples, do not break down in the environment and current water filtration technology is unable to remove them.The scientists expect levels of scPFCAS to increase markedly in the future.As part of the efforts to replace CFCs, car manufacturers around the world agreed to use a different coolant in air conditioning called HFC-134a which was introduced in 1992. While HFC-134a was less damaging to the ozone layer, it was unfortunately a very powerful greenhouse gas, around 1,400 times more warming that CO2. So manufacturers in the US and Europe agreed to phase out HFC-134a and by 2017 all new cars had to use a different coolant for air conditioning called HFO-1234yf.While this chemical doesn't damage ozone, and is not a greenhouse gas, it does unfortunately break down to produce short chain PFCAs.""It has a very low global warming potential, but has a much higher propensity to form these persistent products,"" said Prof Young. ""It will be again another shift, where we see an even more dramatic increase.""According to the researchers, these chemicals can travel a long distance in the atmosphere and often end up in lakes and rivers. They cause ""irreversible contamination"" and can impact the health of freshwater creatures including crustaceans and worms. There is growing concern that these compounds may impact human health as well.""They've been found in the bodies of people in China, so it is likely to be found in the bodies of people around the world,"" said Prof Young.""We have done a good job in trying to save the ozone layer but the unintended consequences are the release of these other chemicals, which have some concerns.""""They're toxic, and then they don't get filtered out in various ways.""The study has been published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.Follow Matt on Twitter.",14 May 2020,science
Social distancing: When extreme weather and coronavirus collide,"People being displaced by extreme weather events around the world are being forced to break Covid-19 social distancing safety guidelines, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and other humanitarian agencies.“Social distancing is no longer possible when displaced people are in evacuation centres,” Marshal Makavure, emergency operations co-ordinator of IFRC in Eastern Africa told the BBC.“People have been forced to break the Covid-19 protocol and guidelines under such circumstances.”The BBC has spoken with people living in areas affected by extreme weather events.Subrat Kumar Padhihary, a 38-year-old farmer in Odisha state on India’s east coast, is worried.Indian officials are on alert as Cyclone Amphan, due to hit West Bengal and Odisha on Wednesday, looks likely to intensify into a ""very severe"" storm.Subrat’s village is nearly 40 kilometres from the sea. The house that he shares with his wife, three daughters and mother was badly damaged by Cyclone Fani last year, so he isn’t convinced it can withstand Cyclone Amphan.But even if his house survives, he’s worried about having to leave his village if the authorities say people must evacuate.Subrat feels that might be even more dangerous.“My fear is that we will be taken to nearby schools that have already been turned into Covid-19 quarantine shelters.“There are not many centres in our village, and that means we will have to share the space with people [who may have Covid-19] which will be full of risks.”“West Bengal state has been struggling with Covid-19 cases and that is a cause of concern when it comes to cyclone preparedness,” according to Siddarth Srinivas, food and climate policy lead for Oxfam in Asia.“In the past, some states in India have rescued people by sheltering them in schools and public buildings, but this time doing that is not ideal because of the pandemic.”The Kasese district in western Uganda has been one of the worst hit by recent floods, with hundreds of people displaced.Joseline Kabugho is six months pregnant. The 23 year old has been forced to shelter with her two children in one of the school-turned-camps in the district.She’s staying at the shelter, even though her pregnancy means she is in a high-risk group when it comes to Covid-19 infection. There are nearly 200 displaced people with her at the shelter.“We are so vulnerable now,” she said from a class shared with three other families, which is now her family’s temporary home. “I can’t stay away from other people because of the limited space.“I am worried that I may get the virus, and I am worried about my kids, and my unborn baby,” she told the BBC.Joseline was sleeping next to her two children on the night of 7 May, when she heard other people in her village screaming.“I realised later on that my neighbours were actually telling me to run for my life. The entire village had been hit by a massive flood.“I grabbed my two kids and ran away, I had no time to take anything else.""She had bought some clothes for her unborn baby before the floods. “I could not even save those clothes. The floods took them all.“Whatever we had was swept away.""Her husband works in another district and he has been unable to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions. “I have nowhere to go and I don’t know what to do next.”Relief workers with the Red Cross say thousands of people are now sheltering in churches and schools in flood-hit East Africa with limited access to water and soap.Hundreds have died and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the floods in more than a half a dozen countries.More than 2,700 Covid-19 deaths and nearly 82,000 confirmed cases have been recorded in Africa, according to John Hopkins University.Among the flood affected countries in East Africa, Somalia has the highest death figure of 55, followed by 50 in Kenya and 21 in Tanzania.Tropical cyclone Harold hit Pacific island countries more than a month ago.Some affected countries had to lift Covid-19 restrictions to allow people to take refuge in evacuation centres. Some people are still in evacuation centres now because the pandemic is affecting aid efforts.The worst-hit country, Vanuatu, has extended the state of emergency as more than 92,000 people have been affected, according to Unicef.In Fiji, about 10 evacuation centres are operating because recovery has been very slow and many houses are yet to be rebuilt.“Access to water is still a big challenge as the cyclone has destroyed water supply infrastructures,” said Vani Catanasiga, director of Fiji Council of Social Services.“Without adequate water supply, following Covid-19 hygiene guidelines is very difficult, although the Fijian government has been successful in flattening the Covid-19 infection curve.”Humanitarian agencies say relief operations can help in enforcing Covid-19 guidelines.Red Cross relief worker Irene Nakasiits is distributing water and soap as essentials to the flood-displaced communities in western Uganda.“Although it is challenging to do so, we can still remind affected communities to follow the guidelines,” according to Marshal Mukuvare of the IFRC.“We can have messages written on food and other relief materials, which we distribute in affected places.“This helps people do what they can, even in such adverse conditions.”It’s uncharted territory, according to Siddarth Srinivas, Food and Climate policy lead for Oxfam in Asia. “When it comes to how to deal with extreme weather and a pandemic like Covid-19, the debate has just started.“It needs much more thinking before we come up with solid measures.”  ",20 May 2020,science
Nature crisis: Moths have 'secret role' as crucial pollinators,"Long seen as annoying creatures that can leave holes in your clothes, moths have been badly misjudged, say scientists.New research suggests they play a vital role as overnight pollinators of a wide range of flowers and plants. The study says that the moths' transport networks are larger and more complex than those of daytime pollinators like bees.The authors believe there is an urgent need to stem declines in moth numbers. Over the past decade, public anxiety about the role of our pollinators has focused squarely on bees. The fall-off in their numbers, linked to changes in land and widespread use of pesticides, has helped raise environmental awareness of the critical role these creatures play in the food chain. Moths, though, have not evoked similar sympathies. ""There's this big misconception that all moths come and eat my clothes. That's not what happens at all,"" said Dr Richard Walton, from University College London (UCL), the lead author of the new study.""Some of them happen to be visiting flowers and can be an important part of the pollination process.""To find out how vital a part the moths play, Dr Walton and colleagues monitored moth activity around ponds in agricultural areas of Norfolk. They found that 45% of the moths they tested were transporting pollen, which originated from 47 different plant species, including several that were rarely visited by bees, hoverflies and butterflies. The scientists found that while bumblebees and honeybees are critically important, they tended to target the most prolific nectar and pollen sources. Not so with moths.""From what we see from our work, moths tend to be generalists, meaning they're not specifically visiting a narrow group of flowers,"" said Dr Walton.""They're kind of visiting any type of flower that they can access. These tend to be the open cup-shaped flowers like bramble, they can access things from the legume family, the clover family was also very important.""Previous studies on moths have tended to focus on their ability to transport pollen via their proboscis or nose. This new work looked at the pollen collected on the moths' distinctly hairy bodies when they sit on flowers while feeding. The researchers believe their study shows that moths complement the work of daytime pollinators and help keep plant populations diverse and abundant. They serve as a form of back-up for biodiversity, which in turn supports crop yields.The vital role played by the moths has come under increasing threat as they have suffered steep declines in numbers since the 1970s. This is largely due to changes in land use and the increasing use of pesticides. ""This has a knock-on effect for birds that feed on moths, such as the cuckoo. Its decline is kind of tied to moth declines,"" said Dr Walton.""Bats will feed on moths as well, so there's ties to other creatures having declines in their own populations, because their food supply, the moths, are going down as well. You can see this kind of linkage play out.""Helping the moths will require the use of less pesticide and encouraging a wider diversity of plants in the landscape. But perhaps more importantly, the public perception of moths needs to change. ""Something that's out of sight, is often out of mind,"" said Dr Walton.""We just see bees in the daytime and we see them visiting the flower so they've got the better shift when when it comes to work, in terms of being visible.""""But moths are by no means less important. I think it's vital to raise the profile of moths to help the public at large see the important part they play in our ecology.""The study has been published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters.

Scientists explain magnetic pole's wanderings,"European scientists think they can now describe with confidence what's driving the drift of the North Magnetic Pole. It's shifted in recent years away from Canada towards Siberia.And this rapid movement has required more frequent updates to navigation systems, including those that operate the mapping functions in smartphones.A team, led from Leeds University, says the behaviour is explained by the competition of two magnetic ""blobs"" on the edge of the Earth's outer core.Changes in the flow of molten material in the planet's interior have altered the strength of the above regions of negative magnetic flux. ""This change in the pattern of flow has weakened the patch under Canada and ever so slightly increased the strength of the patch under Siberia,"" explained Dr Phil Livermore.""This is why the North Pole has left its historic position over the Canadian Arctic and crossed over the International Date Line. Northern Russia is winning the 'tug of war', if you like,"" he told BBC News. Earth has three poles at the top of the planet. A geographic pole which is where the planet's rotation axis intersects the surface. The geomagnetic pole is the location which best fits a classic dipole (its position alters little). And then there is the North Magnetic, or dip, Pole, which is where field lines are perpendicular to the surface.It is this third pole that has been doing all the movement. When first identified by explorer James Clark Ross in the 1830s, it was in Canada's Nunavut territory.Back then it didn't wander very far, very fast. But in the 1990s, it took off, racing to ever higher latitudes and crossing the date line in late 2017. In the process, it came to within just a few hundred kilometres of the geographic pole.Using data from satellites that have measured the evolving shape of Earth's magnetic field over the past 20 years, Dr Livermore and colleagues have attempted to model the North Magnetic Pole's wanderings.Two years ago when they first presented their ideas at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Washington DC, they suggested there might be a connection with a westward-accelerating jet of molten material in the outer core. But the models were a complex fit and the team has now revised its assessment to align with a different flow regime.""The jet is tied to quite high northern latitudes and the alteration in the flow in the outer core that's responsible for the change in the position of the pole is actually further south,"" Dr Livermore said. ""There's also a timing issue. The jet acceleration occurs in the 2000s, whereas the pole acceleration begins in the 1990s.""The team's latest modelling indicates the pole will continue to move towards Russia but will in time begin to slow. At top speed, it's been making 50-60km a year.""Whether or not it will move back again in the future is anyone's guess,"" the Leeds scientist told BBC News.The pole's recent race across the top of the world prompted the US National Geophysical Data Center and the British Geological Survey to issue an early update to the World Magnetic Model last year. This model is a representation of Earth's magnetic field across the entire globe. It is incorporated into all navigation devices, including modern smartphones, to correct for any local compass errors.Dr Livermore and colleagues leaned heavily on the data acquired by the European Space Agency's Swarm satellites.

Climate change: Top 10 tips to reduce carbon footprint revealed,"Climate change can still be tackled – but only if people are willing to embrace major shifts in the way we live, a report says.The authors have put together a list of the best ways for people to reduce their carbon footprints.The response to the Covid-19 crisis has shown that the public is willing to accept radical change if they consider it necessary, they explain.And the report adds that government priorities must be re-ordered.Protecting the planet must become the first duty of all decision-makers, the researchers argue.The authors urge the public to contribute by adopting the carbon-cutting measures in the report, which is based on an analysis of 7,000 other studies.Top of the list is living car-free, which saves an average of 2.04 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually. This is followed by driving a battery electric car - 1.95 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually - and taking one less long-haul flight each year - 1.68 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person.Switching to a vegan diet will help - but less than tackling transport, the research shows.It says popular activities such as recycling are worthwhile, but don’t cut emissions by as much.The lead author, Dr Diana Ivanova from Leeds University, told BBC News: “We need a complete change of mindset. “We have to agree how much carbon we can each emit within the limits of what the planet can bear – then make good lives within those boundaries.“The top 10 options are available to us now, without the need for controversial and expensive new technologies.” Dr Ivanova said the coronavirus lockdown has shown that many people could live without cars if public transport, walking and cycling were improved.Her research highlights rich people who typically take more flights, drive bigger cars and consume the most. She said: “All the world suffers from climate change, but it’s not the average person who flies regularly – it’s a small group, yet aviation is under-taxed. It’s a moral issue.”In her league table, buying renewable power and using public transport rank fourth and fifth.Sixth is insulating your home well, which saves 0.895 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.Seventh is switching to a vegan diet, which saves 0.8 tonnes. Other top actions are using heat pumps; switching from polluting cookstoves (in developing countries) to better methods of cooking, and heating buildings with renewable energy. Dr Ivanova said that if people implemented the measures, it would save around nine tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per person per year.Current annual household emissions are around 10 tonnes in the UK, and 17 in the US.The study, out soon in the journal Environmental Research Letters, says the following are worthwhile, but of lesser benefit to the climate: green roofs; using less paper; buying more durable items; turning down the thermostat - and recycling, which saves 0.01 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to Dr Ivanova.Some of the findings will be questioned. Polls suggest some people think climate is as important as the virus, for instance, but some don’t.Professor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “This is a valuable study. But it only looks at the carbon footprint and not at other impacts like water scarcity because of lithium mining for electric car batteries.Libby Peake, from the Green Alliance think tank, told BBC News: “People shouldn’t stop good habits like recycling, which saves some carbon while preventing waste and conserving resources.”  “Better design allows people to buy fewer but higher-quality things and to live in buildings with lower carbon footprints. These savings aren’t necessarily covered by this study.” Follow Roger on Twitter.",20 May 2020,science
Climate change: Scientists fear car surge will see CO2 rebound,"Daily global emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to Covid-19, say scientists.The most comprehensive account yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys. But the authors are worried that, as people return to work, car use will soar again.They fear CO2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis.They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real, durable changes on transport and personal mobility.In the UK, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged £250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure. Other countries are also looking at similar plans.The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to Covid-19 have had a significant impact on the carbon-producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do.Road transport has declined hugely, as has aviation. However, now that the UK is beginning to return to work, Mr Shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport, should walking or cycling not be an option.""If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than travelling by bus, train or tram,"" he said.Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed. Now in detailed analysis, researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of CO2.They've calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97% of global emissions.During the peak of the crisis in early April, daily emissions dropped by 17% compared to the previous year, meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day.The key to the fall has been cars. Surface transport emissions have declined by 43%, the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined. While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact, it only accounts for 10% of the decrease during the pandemic. China has been responsible for the biggest drop, followed by the US, Europe and India.If some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year, then global emissions will likely drop by 7%. If pre-pandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by mid-June, the annual fall would be around 4%. But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound, especially on the roads, could see a carbon surge.Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants, too. One of the UK's leading experts, Prof Frank Kelly, from King's College London, said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two years before US authorities exposed the scandal.He told Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road.Prof Kelly said he reported it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they didn't publish his findings. He said work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal action against car makers that had installed ""defeat devices"" to fool regulators.The government didn't deny the account. A spokesperson said: ""We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the World Health Organization as an 'example for the rest of the world to follow'"".Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 crisis, he said levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60% in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown.Levels of another pollutant, sooty particles, remained at harmful concentrations.""A big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work, and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before, once everybody goes back,"" said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia, who led the analysis.The researchers say that fundamental, systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change. When it comes to transportation, there are huge opportunities, according to Prof Le Quéré. She says that after the global financial crisis in 2008, some governments like China, US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables. ""Here now in 2020 we're very close to the same situation in electric mobility,"" she told BBC News.""Battery prices have come down, we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies.""""So if these two things can align, then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow.""Grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change. A letter signed by 155 major companies, representing $2.4 trillion (£1.96 trillion) in market capitalisation, calls for a net-zero emissions response to the covid crisis. Corporations including Carlsberg, Iberdrola, EDF and Coca Cola Europe say they want governments to ""prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy"".The authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action. They point to the fact that while emissions of CO2 may be temporarily reduced, all the while CO2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet.It will take a a dramatic shift to change that. ""I think very much that we are at a crossroads. And at this point, like the UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, it could go either way.""""He was talking about his own health, but here we're talking about the health of the planet.""""It could go either way.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Follow Matt on Twitter.",19 May 2020,science
