'Black neutron star' discovery changes astronomy,"Scientists have discovered an astronomical object that has never been observed before.It is more massive than collapsed stars, known as ""neutron stars"", but has less mass than black holes.Such ""black neutron stars"" were not thought possible and will mean ideas for how neutron stars and black holes form will need to be rethought.The discovery was made by an international team using gravitational wave detectors in the US and Italy.Charlie Hoy, a PhD student from Cardiff University, UK, involved in the study,  said the new discovery would transform our understanding.""We can't rule out any possibilities,"" he told BBC News. ""We don't know what it is and this is why it is so exciting because it really does change our field.""Mr Hoy is part of an international team working for the Ligo-Virgo Scientific Collaboration.The international group, which has strong UK involvement backed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council, has laser detectors several kilometres long that are able to detect minute ripples in space-time caused by the collision of massive objects in the Universe. The collected data can be used to determine the mass of those objects involved.Last August, the instruments detected the collision of a black hole 23 times the mass of our Sun with an object of 2.6 solar masses. That makes the lighter object more massive than the heaviest type of dead star, or neutron star, previously observed - of just over two solar masses. But it was also lighter than the lightest black hole previously observed - of around five solar masses.Astronomers have been searching for such objects in what they've come to call the ""mass gap"". Writing in the journal The Astrophysical Journal Letters, the research team believes that of all the possibilities, the object is most likely to be a light black hole, but they are not ruling out any other possibilities.Having collided with the large black hole, the object no longer exists. However, there should be further opportunities to learn more about these mass-gap objects from future collisions, according to Prof Stephen Fairhurst, also at Cardiff.""It is a challenge for us to determine what this is,"" he told BBC News. ""Is this the lightest black hole ever, or is it the heaviest neutron star ever?""If it is a light black hole then there is no established theory for how such an object could develop. But Prof Fairhurst's colleague, Prof Fabio Antonioni, has proposed that a solar system with three stars could lead to the formation of light black holes. His ideas are receiving increased attention following the new discovery.If, however, this new class of object is a heavy neutron star then theories for how they form may also need to be revised, according to Prof Bernard Schutz of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany.""We don't know a lot about the nuclear physics of neutron stars. So, people who are looking at exotic equations that explain what goes on inside them might be thinking, 'maybe this is evidence that we can get much heavier neutron stars'.""Both black holes and neutron stars are thought to form when stars run out of fuel and die. If it is a very large star, it collapses to form a black hole, an object with such strong gravitational force that not even light can escape its grasp. If the starting star is below a certain mass, one option is for it to collapse into a dense ball composed entirely of particles called neutrons, which are found inside the heart of atoms. The material from which neutron stars are composed is so tightly packed that one teaspoonful would weigh 10 million tonnes.A neutron star also has powerful gravity pulling it together, but a force between the neutrons, caused by a quantum mechanical effect known as degeneracy pressure, pushes the particles apart, counteracting the gravitational force.Current theories suggest that the gravitational force would overcome the degeneracy pressure if the neutron star were much larger than two solar masses - and cause it to collapse into a black hole.According to Prof Nils Andersson of Southampton University, if the mystery object is a heavy neutron star then the theorists will have to rethink what goes on in these objects.""Nuclear physics is not a precise science where we know everything,"" he said. ""We don't know how nuclear forces operate under the extreme conditions you need inside a neutron star. So, every single current theory we currently have of what goes on inside of one has some uncertainty.""Prof Sheila Rowan, director of the University of Glasgow's Institute for Gravitational Research (IGR), said the discovery challenges current theoretical models.""More cosmic observations and research will need to be undertaken to establish whether this new object is indeed something that has never been observed before or whether it may instead be the lightest black hole ever detected.""Follow Pallab on Twitter",23 June 2020,science
Coronavirus: Wildlife scientists examine the great 'human pause',"Researchers have launched an initiative to track wildlife before, during and after the coronavirus lockdown. The UK-led team's aim is to study what they have called the ""anthropause"" - the global-scale, temporary slowdown in human activity, which is likely to have a profound impact on other species. Measuring that impact, they say, will reveal ways in which we can ""share our increasingly crowded planet"".They outline the mission in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. They outline ""urgent steps"" to allow scientists to learn as much as possible from the sudden absence of humans in many landscapes - including ensuring that researchers have access and permission to carry out their work, and can gain access to information about human movement, as well as animal-tracking data. Prof Christian Rutz from the University of St Andrews is president of the International Bio-logging Society. He pointed out that bio-loggers - small tracking devices fitted to animals in order to record their movements and other behaviour - have been collecting information in habitats all over the world throughout the pandemic. ""There is a really valuable research opportunity here, one that's been brought about by the most tragic circumstances, but it's one we think we can't afford to miss,"" he told BBC News.  Usually, studies which try to examine the impact of human presence and activity on wild animals are limited to comparing protected habitats to unprotected areas, or studying landscapes in the wake of a natural disaster. ""But during lockdown we have this replicated around the globe -  in different localities and for habitats where some species have been fitted with tracking devices the whole time,"" said Prof Rutz.There have been many accounts on social media of wildlife apparently making the most of our absence  - moving freely through surprisingly urban settings. In some places though, the lack of human activity appears to have been detrimental - increases in poaching driven by poverty, and the absence of ecotourism. ""No one's saying that humans should stay in lockdown permanently,"" added Prof Rutz. ""But what if we see major impacts of our changes in road use, for example? We could use that to make small changes to our transport network that could have major benefits.""Prof Jim Smith from the University of Portsmouth has been part of what might be considered the first anthropause study - a long-term investigation into the changes in the abandoned landscape around the damaged Chernobyl nuclear power plant.""Just a few years after the evacuation of the Exclusion Zone, Belarussian and Ukrainian researchers found species associated with humans - like pigeons and rats - were disappearing, but wild animals - wild boar, deer and wolf - were multiplying,"" he said.  ""Still abandoned more than 30 years later, the zone has become an iconic example of accidental rewilding.""""At great economic and human cost, Covid and Chernobyl forced us to push the pause button on our environmental damage,"" Prof Smith continued.  ""Stopping some of those impacts altogether will be hard, but will be helped by what we can learn from these extreme events.""Prof Rutz and his team pointed out in their paper: ""Scientific knowledge gained during this devastating crisis will allow us to develop innovative strategies for sharing space on this increasingly crowded planet, with benefits for both wildlife and humans.""Follow Victoria on Twitter",23 June 2020,science
Climate change: Planting new forests 'can do more harm than good',"Rather than benefiting the environment, large-scale tree planting may do the opposite, two new studies have found.One paper says that financial incentives to plant trees can backfire and reduce biodiversity with little impact on carbon emissions. A separate project found that the amount of carbon that new forests can absorb may be overestimated. The key message from both papers is that planting trees is not a simple climate solution. Over the past few years, the idea of planting trees as a low cost, high impact solution to climate change has really taken hold. Previous studies have indicated that trees have enormous potential to soak up and store carbon, and many countries have established tree planting campaigns as a key element of their plans to tackle climate change. In the UK, promises by the political parties to plant ever larger numbers of trees were a feature of last year's general election.In the US, even President Donald Trump has rowed in behind the Trillion Trees Campaign.Legislation to support the idea has been introduced into the US Congress.Another major tree planting initiative is called the Bonn Challenge.Countries are being urged to restore 350 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2030.So far, around 40 nations have endorsed the idea.But scientists have urged caution against the headlong rush to plant new forests. They point to the fact that in the Bonn Challenge nearly 80% of the commitments made to date involve planting monoculture plantations or a limited mix of trees that produce specific products such as fruit or rubber. The authors of this new study have looked closely at the financial incentives given to private landowners to plant trees. These payments are seen as a key element of increasing the number of trees significantly. The study looked at the example of Chile, where a decree subsidising tree planting ran from 1974 to 2012, and was widely seen as a globally influential afforestation policy.The law subsidised 75% of the costs of planting new forests. While it was intended not to apply to existing forests, lax enforcement and budgetary limitations meant that some landowners simply replaced native forests with more profitable new tree plantations. Their study found the subsidy scheme expanded the area covered by trees, but decreased the area of native forest. The authors point out that since Chile's native forests are rich in biodiversity and store large amounts of carbon, the subsidy scheme failed to increase the carbon stores and accelerated biodiversity loss.""If policies to incentivise tree plantations are poorly designed or poorly enforced, there is a high risk of not only wasting public money but also releasing more carbon and losing biodiversity,"" said co-author Prof Eric Lambin, from Stanford University. ""That's the exact opposite of what these policies are aiming for.""A second study set out to examine how much carbon a newly planted forest would be able to absorb from the atmosphere.Up until now, many scientists have calculated the amount of carbon that trees can pull down from the air using a fixed ratio.Suspecting that this ratio would depend on local conditions, the researchers looked at northern China, which has seen intensive tree planting by the government because of climate change but also in an effort to reduce dust from the Gobi desert. Looking at 11,000 soil samples taken from afforested plots, the scientists found that in carbon poor soils, adding new trees did increase the density of organic carbon. But where soils were already rich in carbon, adding new trees decreased this density. The authors say that previous assumptions about how much organic carbon can be fixed by planting new trees is likely an overestimate. ""We hope that people can understand that afforestation practices are not one single thing,"" said Dr Anping Chen, from Colorado State University and a lead author on the study. ""Afforestation involves many technical details and balances of different parts, and it cannot solve all our climate problems.""Both papers have been published in the journal Nature Sustainability.Follow Matt on Twitter.",22 June 2020,science
Arctic Circle sees 'highest-ever' recorded temperatures,"Temperatures in the Arctic Circle are likely to have hit an all-time record on Saturday, reaching a scorching 38C (100F) in Verkhoyansk, a Siberian town.The record still needs to be verified, but it appears to have been 18C higher than the average maximum daily temperature in June.Hot summer weather is not uncommon in the Arctic Circle, but recent months have seen abnormally high temperatures.The Arctic is believed to be warming twice as fast as the global average.Verkhoyansk, home to about 1,300 people, sits just inside the Arctic Circle, in remote Siberia. It has an extreme climate with temperatures plunging in January to an average maximum of -42C and then surging in June to 20C.But a persistent heatwave this year in the Arctic Circle has worried meteorologists. In March, April and May, the Copernicus Climate Change service reported that the average temperature was around 10C above normal. Earlier in June, parts of Siberia recorded 30C, while in May, Khatanga in Russia - situated in the Arctic Circle at 72 degrees north - set a new May temperature record of 25.4C.""Year-on-year temperature records are being broken around the world, but the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth,"" said Dr Dann Mitchell, associate professor in atmospheric science at the University of Bristol. ""So it is unsurprising to see records being broken in this region. We will see more of this in the near future.""   Analysis by Simon King, BBC Weather meteorologistHeatwaves in the Arctic aren't unusual. Weather patterns around the world can align in such a way that hot air is transported quite far northward and colder air from the poles southward. Over the last few months a large area of high pressure in eastern Russia has been dominant. This has led to southerly winds bringing warmer air from near the tropics, leading to higher than average temperatures. However, the persistence of this weather pattern has led to a longevity and scale of heat that is worrying. This is consistent with what climatologists believe will happen in the Arctic with climate change.Most scientists agree that over the past 30 years, the Arctic has warmed at a rate of twice the global average. The graphic below shows that across the globe, through the period 1960-2019, average air temperature has generally increased by around 1C.  However, as you head closer to the North Pole - latitude 90° - the reds become darker. This shows how the temperature has increased here more than anywhere else - by around 4C.Warming in the Arctic is leading to the thawing of once permanently frozen permafrost below ground.This is alarming scientists because as permafrost thaws, carbon dioxide and methane previously locked up below ground is released.These greenhouse gases can cause further warming, and further thawing of the permafrost, in a vicious cycle known as positive feedback.The higher temperatures also cause land ice in the Arctic to melt at a faster rate, leading to greater run-off into the ocean where it contributes to sea-level rise.There is also an element of positive feedback here, says BBC Weather, because the loss of highly reflective white ice means that the ground and sea absorb more heat. This leads to more warming.The impact of wildfires are also a consideration. Last summer, they ravaged parts of the Arctic. Although they are common in summer, high temperatures and strong winds made them unusually severe.They typically start in early May before peaking in July and August but by late April this year they were already ten times bigger in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia compared to the same time last year, Russia's emergencies minister said.Well, 2020 is certainly shaping up to be a contender.  The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, reckons there's a 50:50 chance it'll be the hottest year ever recorded. Much of northern Europe and Asia has had an exceptionally mild spring and early summer with temperatures 10C higher than normal in some areas. The hottest year to date is 2016. It is still a nose ahead, but the margins are ""very close"".Of course, this should come as no surprise.""We've upset the energy balance of the entire planet,"" cautions Prof Chris Rapley of University College London. Year after year we see temperature records being broken, the eminent climate scientist says.""This is a warning message from the Earth itself,"" he tells me. ""We ignore it at our peril.""",22 June 2020,science

This leads to more warming.The impact of wildfires are also a consideration. Last summer, they ravaged parts of the Arctic. Although they are common in summer, high temperatures and strong winds made them unusually severe.They typically start in early May before peaking in July and August but by late April this year they were already ten times bigger in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia compared to the same time last year, Russia's emergencies minister said.Well, 2020 is certainly shaping up to be a contender.  The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, reckons there's a 50:50 chance it'll be the hottest year ever recorded. Much of northern Europe and Asia has had an exceptionally mild spring and early summer with temperatures 10C higher than normal in some areas. The hottest year to date is 2016. It is still a nose ahead, but the margins are ""very close"".Of course, this should come as no surprise.""We've upset the energy balance of the entire planet,"" cautions Prof Chris Rapley of University College London.

'Black neutron star' discovery changes astronomy,"Scientists have discovered an astronomical object that has never been observed before.It is more massive than collapsed stars, known as ""neutron stars"", but has less mass than black holes.Such ""black neutron stars"" were not thought possible and will mean ideas for how neutron stars and black holes form will need to be rethought.The discovery was made by an international team using gravitational wave detectors in the US and Italy.Charlie Hoy, a PhD student from Cardiff University, UK, involved in the study,  said the new discovery would transform our understanding.""We can't rule out any possibilities,"" he told BBC News. ""We don't know what it is and this is why it is so exciting because it really does change our field.""Mr Hoy is part of an international team working for the Ligo-Virgo Scientific Collaboration.The international group, which has strong UK involvement backed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council, has laser detectors several kilometres long that are able to detect minute ripples in space-time caused by the collision of massive objects in the Universe. The collected data can be used to determine the mass of those objects involved.Last August, the instruments detected the collision of a black hole 23 times the mass of our Sun with an object of 2.6 solar masses. That makes the lighter object more massive than the heaviest type of dead star, or neutron star, previously observed - of just over two solar masses. But it was also lighter than the lightest black hole previously observed - of around five solar masses.Astronomers have been searching for such objects in what they've come to call the ""mass gap"". Writing in the journal The Astrophysical Journal Letters, the research team believes that of all the possibilities, the object is most likely to be a light black hole, but they are not ruling out any other possibilities.Having collided with the large black hole, the object no longer exists. However, there should be further opportunities to learn more about these mass-gap objects from future collisions, according to Prof Stephen Fairhurst, also at Cardiff.""It is a challenge for us to determine what this is,"" he told BBC News. ""Is this the lightest black hole ever, or is it the heaviest neutron star ever?""If it is a light black hole then there is no established theory for how such an object could develop. But Prof Fairhurst's colleague, Prof Fabio Antonioni, has proposed that a solar system with three stars could lead to the formation of light black holes. His ideas are receiving increased attention following the new discovery.If, however, this new class of object is a heavy neutron star then theories for how they form may also need to be revised, according to Prof Bernard Schutz of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany.""We don't know a lot about the nuclear physics of neutron stars. So, people who are looking at exotic equations that explain what goes on inside them might be thinking, 'maybe this is evidence that we can get much heavier neutron stars'.""Both black holes and neutron stars are thought to form when stars run out of fuel and die. If it is a very large star, it collapses to form a black hole, an object with such strong gravitational force that not even light can escape its grasp. If the starting star is below a certain mass, one option is for it to collapse into a dense ball composed entirely of particles called neutrons, which are found inside the heart of atoms. The material from which neutron stars are composed is so tightly packed that one teaspoonful would weigh 10 million tonnes.A neutron star also has powerful gravity pulling it together, but a force between the neutrons, caused by a quantum mechanical effect known as degeneracy pressure, pushes the particles apart, counteracting the gravitational force.Current theories suggest that the gravitational force would overcome the degeneracy pressure if the neutron star were much larger than two solar masses - and cause it to collapse into a black hole.According to Prof Nils Andersson of Southampton University, if the mystery object is a heavy neutron star then the theorists will have to rethink what goes on in these objects.""Nuclear physics is not a precise science where we know everything,"" he said. ""We don't know how nuclear forces operate under the extreme conditions you need inside a neutron star. So, every single current theory we currently have of what goes on inside of one has some uncertainty.""Prof Sheila Rowan, director of the University of Glasgow's Institute for Gravitational Research (IGR), said the discovery challenges current theoretical models.""More cosmic observations and research will need to be undertaken to establish whether this new object is indeed something that has never been observed before or whether it may instead be the lightest black hole ever detected.""Follow Pallab on Twitter",23 June 2020,science
Coronavirus: Wildlife scientists examine the great 'human pause',"Researchers have launched an initiative to track wildlife before, during and after the coronavirus lockdown. The UK-led team's aim is to study what they have called the ""anthropause"" - the global-scale, temporary slowdown in human activity, which is likely to have a profound impact on other species. Measuring that impact, they say, will reveal ways in which we can ""share our increasingly crowded planet"".They outline the mission in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. They outline ""urgent steps"" to allow scientists to learn as much as possible from the sudden absence of humans in many landscapes - including ensuring that researchers have access and permission to carry out their work, and can gain access to information about human movement, as well as animal-tracking data. Prof Christian Rutz from the University of St Andrews is president of the International Bio-logging Society. He pointed out that bio-loggers - small tracking devices fitted to animals in order to record their movements and other behaviour - have been collecting information in habitats all over the world throughout the pandemic. ""There is a really valuable research opportunity here, one that's been brought about by the most tragic circumstances, but it's one we think we can't afford to miss,"" he told BBC News.  Usually, studies which try to examine the impact of human presence and activity on wild animals are limited to comparing protected habitats to unprotected areas, or studying landscapes in the wake of a natural disaster. ""But during lockdown we have this replicated around the globe -  in different localities and for habitats where some species have been fitted with tracking devices the whole time,"" said Prof Rutz.There have been many accounts on social media of wildlife apparently making the most of our absence  - moving freely through surprisingly urban settings. In some places though, the lack of human activity appears to have been detrimental - increases in poaching driven by poverty, and the absence of ecotourism. ""No one's saying that humans should stay in lockdown permanently,"" added Prof Rutz. ""But what if we see major impacts of our changes in road use, for example? We could use that to make small changes to our transport network that could have major benefits.""Prof Jim Smith from the University of Portsmouth has been part of what might be considered the first anthropause study - a long-term investigation into the changes in the abandoned landscape around the damaged Chernobyl nuclear power plant.""Just a few years after the evacuation of the Exclusion Zone, Belarussian and Ukrainian researchers found species associated with humans - like pigeons and rats - were disappearing, but wild animals - wild boar, deer and wolf - were multiplying,"" he said.  ""Still abandoned more than 30 years later, the zone has become an iconic example of accidental rewilding.""""At great economic and human cost, Covid and Chernobyl forced us to push the pause button on our environmental damage,"" Prof Smith continued.  ""Stopping some of those impacts altogether will be hard, but will be helped by what we can learn from these extreme events.""Prof Rutz and his team pointed out in their paper: ""Scientific knowledge gained during this devastating crisis will allow us to develop innovative strategies for sharing space on this increasingly crowded planet, with benefits for both wildlife and humans.""Follow Victoria on Twitter",23 June 2020,science
Climate change: Planting new forests 'can do more harm than good',"Rather than benefiting the environment, large-scale tree planting may do the opposite, two new studies have found.One paper says that financial incentives to plant trees can backfire and reduce biodiversity with little impact on carbon emissions. A separate project found that the amount of carbon that new forests can absorb may be overestimated. The key message from both papers is that planting trees is not a simple climate solution. Over the past few years, the idea of planting trees as a low cost, high impact solution to climate change has really taken hold. Previous studies have indicated that trees have enormous potential to soak up and store carbon, and many countries have established tree planting campaigns as a key element of their plans to tackle climate change. In the UK, promises by the political parties to plant ever larger numbers of trees were a feature of last year's general election.In the US, even President Donald Trump has rowed in behind the Trillion Trees Campaign.Legislation to support the idea has been introduced into the US Congress.Another major tree planting initiative is called the Bonn Challenge.Countries are being urged to restore 350 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2030.So far, around 40 nations have endorsed the idea.But scientists have urged caution against the headlong rush to plant new forests. They point to the fact that in the Bonn Challenge nearly 80% of the commitments made to date involve planting monoculture plantations or a limited mix of trees that produce specific products such as fruit or rubber. The authors of this new study have looked closely at the financial incentives given to private landowners to plant trees. These payments are seen as a key element of increasing the number of trees significantly. The study looked at the example of Chile, where a decree subsidising tree planting ran from 1974 to 2012, and was widely seen as a globally influential afforestation policy.The law subsidised 75% of the costs of planting new forests. While it was intended not to apply to existing forests, lax enforcement and budgetary limitations meant that some landowners simply replaced native forests with more profitable new tree plantations. Their study found the subsidy scheme expanded the area covered by trees, but decreased the area of native forest. The authors point out that since Chile's native forests are rich in biodiversity and store large amounts of carbon, the subsidy scheme failed to increase the carbon stores and accelerated biodiversity loss.""If policies to incentivise tree plantations are poorly designed or poorly enforced, there is a high risk of not only wasting public money but also releasing more carbon and losing biodiversity,"" said co-author Prof Eric Lambin, from Stanford University. ""That's the exact opposite of what these policies are aiming for.""A second study set out to examine how much carbon a newly planted forest would be able to absorb from the atmosphere.Up until now, many scientists have calculated the amount of carbon that trees can pull down from the air using a fixed ratio.Suspecting that this ratio would depend on local conditions, the researchers looked at northern China, which has seen intensive tree planting by the government because of climate change but also in an effort to reduce dust from the Gobi desert. Looking at 11,000 soil samples taken from afforested plots, the scientists found that in carbon poor soils, adding new trees did increase the density of organic carbon. But where soils were already rich in carbon, adding new trees decreased this density. The authors say that previous assumptions about how much organic carbon can be fixed by planting new trees is likely an overestimate. ""We hope that people can understand that afforestation practices are not one single thing,"" said Dr Anping Chen, from Colorado State University and a lead author on the study. ""Afforestation involves many technical details and balances of different parts, and it cannot solve all our climate problems.""Both papers have been published in the journal Nature Sustainability.Follow Matt on Twitter.",22 June 2020,science
Arctic Circle sees 'highest-ever' recorded temperatures,"Temperatures in the Arctic Circle are likely to have hit an all-time record on Saturday, reaching a scorching 38C (100F) in Verkhoyansk, a Siberian town.The record still needs to be verified, but it appears to have been 18C higher than the average maximum daily temperature in June.Hot summer weather is not uncommon in the Arctic Circle, but recent months have seen abnormally high temperatures.The Arctic is believed to be warming twice as fast as the global average.Verkhoyansk, home to about 1,300 people, sits just inside the Arctic Circle, in remote Siberia. It has an extreme climate with temperatures plunging in January to an average maximum of -42C and then surging in June to 20C.But a persistent heatwave this year in the Arctic Circle has worried meteorologists. In March, April and May, the Copernicus Climate Change service reported that the average temperature was around 10C above normal. Earlier in June, parts of Siberia recorded 30C, while in May, Khatanga in Russia - situated in the Arctic Circle at 72 degrees north - set a new May temperature record of 25.4C.""Year-on-year temperature records are being broken around the world, but the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth,"" said Dr Dann Mitchell, associate professor in atmospheric science at the University of Bristol. ""So it is unsurprising to see records being broken in this region. We will see more of this in the near future.""   Analysis by Simon King, BBC Weather meteorologistHeatwaves in the Arctic aren't unusual. Weather patterns around the world can align in such a way that hot air is transported quite far northward and colder air from the poles southward. Over the last few months a large area of high pressure in eastern Russia has been dominant. This has led to southerly winds bringing warmer air from near the tropics, leading to higher than average temperatures. However, the persistence of this weather pattern has led to a longevity and scale of heat that is worrying. This is consistent with what climatologists believe will happen in the Arctic with climate change.Most scientists agree that over the past 30 years, the Arctic has warmed at a rate of twice the global average. The graphic below shows that across the globe, through the period 1960-2019, average air temperature has generally increased by around 1C.  However, as you head closer to the North Pole - latitude 90° - the reds become darker. This shows how the temperature has increased here more than anywhere else - by around 4C.Warming in the Arctic is leading to the thawing of once permanently frozen permafrost below ground.This is alarming scientists because as permafrost thaws, carbon dioxide and methane previously locked up below ground is released.These greenhouse gases can cause further warming, and further thawing of the permafrost, in a vicious cycle known as positive feedback.The higher temperatures also cause land ice in the Arctic to melt at a faster rate, leading to greater run-off into the ocean where it contributes to sea-level rise.There is also an element of positive feedback here, says BBC Weather, because the loss of highly reflective white ice means that the ground and sea absorb more heat.

Climate change: Sport heading for a fall as temperatures rise,"Global sport faces major disruption from climate change in coming decades, according to a new analysis.By 2050, it's estimated that almost one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year. But tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says. The study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously.While the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot.Extreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years. A typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there. Smoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year. These and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new study compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt.As football slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050.In the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat.Cricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies.Venues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade. In golf, one in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says. Winter sports also face an uncertain future. Researchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050.But as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions. The author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country like Bolivia at the low end but as large as a country like Spain on the high end.The estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate.Whatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author. ""Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,"" said David Goldblatt.""Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,"" he said.While some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050, the majority of sports authorities have not. The International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up. Among winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, ""which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,"" the report waspishly notes. The report was commissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance, a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change. ""A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,"" said Andrew Simms from the group.""If players also speak out and say they believe clean air and a stable climate matter, millions more will see the possibilities for change.  It will not only send a message of hope for the wider world, but it will help to guarantee a planet that is safe for sport.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.",20 June 2020,science
Urban dwellers yearn for 'Good Life' allotments,"Land set aside for allotments in the UK has declined by 65% from a peak in the ""dig for victory"" and post-war era.Scientists estimated that the lost allotments could have provided 6% of the population with their ""five-a-day"" fruit and veg diet.The most deprived areas suffered the worst decline, experiencing eight times the level of allotment closures compared with the most affluent areas.The study's findings appear in the Landscape and Urban Planning journal.""We found that, overall, there had been a 65% decline in the total area of allotment land from its peak (1950s) to 2016,"" explained co-author Miriam Dobson from the University of Sheffield. ""In terms of the amount of the amount of food production capacity lost, the closed allotment land could have fed 6% of the population on their 'five-a-day' diet.""The researchers decided to assess the volume of land set aside for allotments because although it was widely assumed  that there had been a decline since the peak during the ""dig for victory"" and post-war years, there was no data available. The team also wanted to understand if any of the former allotments could be reinstated as allotments to meet the renewed demand for allotments. They said that the waiting list for an allotment plot was an estimated 100,000 people in 2013.To gather the data it needed, the study looked at 10 geographically distributed cities across the UK, using historical Ordnance Survey maps of the 20th Century. It was then possible to plot the land used as allotments and monitor land-use change over the decades.Ms Dobson, a PhD student at the university's Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, said there were a number of factors behind the reduction of allotment plots.""There was reduced demand after the 1950s as people relied more on supermarkets and convenience stores,"" she told BBC News. ""There was also a loss in leisure time, which meant people did not have the time to attend to their allotment plots, and a loss of food growing knowledge created barriers to entry.""As well as this, as the urban population was growing, urban land became increasingly valuable to developers.""Yet regarding the allotment sites that had been closed, the team found that about a quarter of the land had not been developed for buildings but had been used as another form of green space.  ""If the land within this was potentially suitable for reconversion to allotments was changed back to food production, the space available could meet up to 100% of the waiting list demand in the cities,"" observed Ms Dobson. In recent years, the demand for allotment plots has seen a renaissance, which many younger people wanted to grow their own fruit and veg, rather than it being seen as the preserve of pensioners.During the Covid-19 lockdown, people with allotments have been spending a lot of their time on their plots, growing plenty of fresh fruit and veg - which, at times, have been challenging to source in supermarkets.Ms Dobson observed: ""We have already seen a huge increase in the number of people interested in growing their own food as a result of coronavirus, with garden centres and online shops selling out of seeds in the first weeks of lockdown.""Coronavirus has… highlighted to people the fragility inherent within our globalised food system. In a time of crisis, interest in self-sufficiency rises.She added that she felt there would likely be a surge in demand for allotment following this pandemic.The team felt their study showed the importance of making sure that urban food production, such as allotments, were protected from being shut down, as well as highlighting the potential to expand such sites in towns and cities to meet demand.",19 June 2020,science
Nasa Mars rover: Key questions about Perseverance,"On 20 July, Nasa will get its first opportunity to launch the Perseverance rover to Mars. Here, we answer some common questions about the mission.The Perseverance rover will land on Mars to search out signs of past microbial life, if it ever existed. It will be the first Nasa mission to hunt directly for these ""biosignatures"" since the Viking missions in the 1970s. The rover will collect samples of rock and soil, encase them in tubes, and leave them on the planet's surface for return to Earth at a future date. Perseverance will also study the Red Planet's geology and test how future crewed Mars missions could produce oxygen from CO2 in the atmosphere. This oxygen could be used for breathing and fuel.In addition, a drone-like helicopter will be deployed to demonstrate the first powered flight on Mars. Perseverance will explore Mars' Jezero Crater for at least one Martian year (about 687 Earth days).The one-tonne, car-sized rover is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on an Atlas 5 rocket between 20 July and 11 August 2020. Perseverance travels to Mars enclosed in a protective aeroshell consisting of two parts: a conical backshell and a curved heat shield. The aeroshell is connected to a cruise stage that fires thrusters to keep the spacecraft on course, ensuring it arrives at Mars in the right place for landing. Perseverance will make its seven-minute descent to the Martian surface on 18 February 2021.The relative positions of Earth and Mars mean that launch opportunities come up only every 26 months. If Perseverance didn't launch to Mars this summer, the mission would have to wait until September 2022 to try again.As the spacecraft ploughs through the Martian atmosphere, its heat shield will have to endure temperatures as high as 2,100C (3,800F). When it's about 11km (7mi) above the ground, the spacecraft will deploy a parachute, slowing the heaviest payload in the history of Mars exploration from a speed of Mach 1.7 (2,099 km/h; 1,304 mph) to about 320 km/h (200 mph).The heat shield subsequently drops away from the backshell and, for a short time, the rover - which is attached to a descent stage - falls freely towards the ground. Eight retrorockets on the descent stage then fire, allowing the ""sky crane"" manoeuvre to be performed. Perseverance is lowered slowly on three nylon ropes and an ""umbilical cord"". When the rover's wheels touch the ground, the tethers are severed and the descent stage flies to a safe distance.The rover's target is a 49km (30 mi) -wide impact depression just north of Mars' equator. More than 3.5 billion years ago, scientists think, river channels spilled over the wall of Jezero Crater to form a lake. The large bowl is also home to one of the best preserved Martian examples of a delta, a sedimentary structure that forms when rivers enter open bodies of water and deposit rocks, sand and - potentially - organic carbon in layers. Microbes could have lived in the crater when water was there. Jezero preserves a record of important geological processes such as impact cratering and volcanism, as well as the action of water. Studying its rocks will shed light on how the planet evolved over time.Jezero's fan-shaped delta is one of the prime targets in the hunt for signs of past life. Scientists also see carbonate minerals deposited around the crater's shoreline like the ring in a bathtub. When carbonates precipitate out of water, they can trap things that are in it, including evidence of life.""We'll be searching for biosignatures - patterns, textures or substances that require the influence of life to form,"" says deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan. We don't know what Martian biosignatures might look like, but the ancient Earth might provide clues. A record of our planet's early life can be found in stromatolites, rocks originally formed by the growth of layer after layer of bacteria. If similar structures exist on Mars, scientists could combine measurements from different instruments to assess the likelihood of a biological origin.Today, Mars is cold and dry, with a thin atmosphere that exposes the surface to harmful levels of cosmic radiation. But billions of years ago, the planet appears to have been wetter, with a thicker atmosphere. Multiple lines of evidence, such as the presence of mudstones and sedimentary bands, show that there was once liquid water on the surface. This is important because water is an essential ingredient for all life on Earth. Curiosity also found organic molecules preserved in three-billion-year-old sedimentary rocks. While tantalising, it's not clear whether these organics preserve a record of ancient life, were their food, or have nothing to do with biological processes.Perseverance is carrying an advanced payload of science instruments to gather information about Mars' geology, atmosphere, environmental conditions and potential biosignatures:Ingenuity is a 1.8kg (4lb) helicopter that will ride to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance. Nasa wants to demonstrate powered flight in Mars' thin atmosphere. The Red Planet's gravity is lower (about one-third that of Earth's), but its atmosphere is just 1% the density of Earth's. This makes it harder to generate the lift required to get off the ground. Equipped with two counter-rotating blades, the autonomous helicopter can take colour images with a 13-megapixel camera, the same type commonly found in smartphones. Rotorcraft could be a useful way to explore other worlds: flying vehicles travel faster than ground-based rovers, and can reach areas that are inaccessible to wheeled vehicles.Perseverance is very similar to its predecessor Curiosity in terms of overall design, but there are key differences. As well as the new science payload, Perseverance has a larger ""hand"", or turret, on the end of its robotic arm to hold a heavier suite of tools, including a coring drill. The system designed to cache samples is also a new feature. Engineers have re-designed the rover's wheels to make them more resistant to wear and tear. Curiosity's wheels sustained damage from driving over sharp, pointed rocks.The rover's Sample Caching System is composed of three robotic elements. The most visible is the 2.1m (7ft) -long, five-jointed robotic arm, which is bolted to the chassis. A rotary percussive drill on the arm's turret is able to cut out intact cores of Martian rock. These cores - about the size of a piece of chalk - go into a sample tube. The main robot arm then places the filled tube on a mechanism at the front of the rover called the bit carousel.This mechanism, which recalls a 1960s slide projector, moves the tube inside the rover where a smaller, 0.5m (1.6ft) -long sample handling arm (also called the T. rex arm) grabs it. An image is taken before the tube is hermetically sealed and placed in a storage rack. It's driven around on the rover until the team finds a suitable place to drop it off.For decades, scientists have wanted to deliver samples of Martian rock and soil to Earth for study in laboratories. Here, scientists could investigate the samples with instruments too large and complex to send to Mars. By leaving rock and soil samples on the surface in sealed tubes, Perseverance will lay the groundwork for that to happen. As part of the programme known as Mars Sample Return, a separate mission will be sent to land on Mars to pick up the tubes using a ""fetch"" rover. A robotic arm will then transfer the tubes from the fetch rover into a rocket called the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The ascent vehicle blasts the samples into Martian orbit where they are captured by an orbiter. This orbiter will then deliver the sample containers to Earth, possibly by 2031.Follow Paul on Twitter.",23 June 2020,science
Nasa's next Mars rover will be called Perseverance,"The American space agency has a new name for the rover it will be sending to the Red Planet this summer.To date, the project has been known only by its code name - Mars 2020.From now on, it will be referred to as the Perseverance rover.The name came out of a schools competition that drew 28,000 entries.The Perseverance rover will begin the process of trying to bring rocks back to Earth for study.It will trundle through an equatorial crater, looking for the best samples it can cache for retrieval by a later mission.Scientists think this will be the best approach to establishing whether or not life has ever existed on Mars.Nasa's naming competition asked children to submit their favoured name along with a supporting 150-word essay. An army of volunteers — educators, professionals and space enthusiasts — was employed to whittle down the avalanche of ideas into a more manageable shortlist of nine on which the public was then asked to vote.Nasa's director of science, Thomas Zurbuchen, announced the winner on Thursday.The name Perseverance was suggested by Alexander Mather, a 13-year-old student from Virginia.The competition follows in the tradition of previous Mars rover missions.Nasa's first wheeled robot, which landed on the planet in 1997, was called the Microrover Flight Experiment until a 12-year-old student from Connecticut suggested the name Sojourner, in honour of abolitionist and women's rights activist Sojourner Truth. The 2004 rovers Spirit and Opportunity got their names from an Arizona student, and the agency's most recent vehicle, Curiosity, received its moniker from an 11-year-old Kansas pupil.Alexander Mather, who wants to be a Nasa engineer when he grows up, had referenced some of these missions in his winning essay.He wrote: ""Curiosity, Insight, Spirit, Opportunity. If you think about it, all of these names of past Mars rovers are qualities we possess as humans. ""We're always curious and seek opportunity. We have the spirit and insight to explore the Moon, Mars and beyond. ""But if rovers are to be the qualities of us as a race, we missed the most important thing: Perseverance.""We as humans evolved as creatures who could learn to adapt to any situation, no matter how harsh. We are a species of explorers, and we will meet many setbacks on the way to Mars. However, we can persevere. We, not as a nation, but as humans will not give up. The human race will always persevere into the future.""The Perseverance rover has recently arrived at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to begin its final preparations for launch. This will take place between 17 July and 5 August. It's a seven-month cruise to the Red Planet. Engineers have targeted a touchdown for shortly after 20:30 GMT on Thursday, 18 February, 2021. Lori Glaze, director of the agency's planetary science division, said: ""The Perseverance rover is going to be collecting samples. It's the first leg of the first round trip from Earth to Mars and back. We're hoping in the 2030s that we will be bringing those samples back here to Earth. That'll be incredibly cool.""Three other missions are due to leave for Mars this year, including a rover from China and an orbiter from the United Arab Emirates. Europe is also supposed to be sending a rover called Rosalind Franklin but there is currently significant uncertainty over whether it will be ready in time.

Nasa's 2020 rover: Can we finally answer the big question about Mars?,"Exactly a year from now, a capsule will come hurtling through the atmosphere of Mars with the Americans' next big rover. If it survives the ""seven minutes of terror"" that describe its descent to the surface, the new robot promises a very different mission to all those that have gone before it. Because although Mars 2020 looks like a simple copy of the Curiosity vehicle of 2012, its goals take a decisive turn towards answering the most fundamental of questions: is there - or has there ever been - life on the Red Planet? Recent investigations have concentrated on characterising the ""habitability"" of Mars.That's to say, these prior missions asked only if past conditions were conducive to biology. A less direct approach. Mars 2020, on the other hand, will be engaged in an explicit hunt for life's traces. Undeniably it'll be a difficult quest. Evidence for life on the early Earth always attracts a degree of scepticism, even controversy, and laboratory equipment the size of a large room is often required to back up a claim. So how will people react if a rover finds something intriguing imprinted in billions-of-years-old rock on another planet? 2020 mission scientist Jim Bell from Arizona State University is candid in his response: ""We can make a claim about a biosignature, but it's not clear to me anyone would believe us,"" he said. ""So, let's bring the samples back. So if those extraordinary claims are made, they can be verified."" This then is the strategy for Mars 2020: Find something remarkable and cache it for later return to one of those big Earth laboratories. The rover will trundle across equatorial Jezero Crater seeking out rocks that look as though they might have been laid down in the presence of biology. The best examples will be drilled and sealed in small tubes the size of whiteboard markers. These canisters will then be placed on the surface for a later mission to pick up and take home. But what would putative biosignatures look like?A good example, says Katie Stack Morgan, might be remnants of finely layered, dome-like structures associated with ancient communities of microbes. On Earth we know such structures as stromatolites, which form at the edges of salty lakes and lagoons. It's all about recognising tell-tale patterns, textures, and chemical compositions, the deputy project scientist told BBC News: ""What [these microbes] leave behind in the rock record are very thin layers, but with concentrations of particular elements or organics at those repeated intervals that represent the ancient fossilised microbial mat. So as those mats grow, they basically form the rock. And so we're looking for those fine laminations with concentrations of organics or certain elements that wouldn't be expected if these things were just abiotic, or didn't involve life.""When Curiosity landed in Gale Crater in 2012, scientists were uncertain about its history, how the mountain at its centre formed and what sort of influence water may have played in the evolution of the deep depression. Jezero carries far more certainty. Satellite pictures clearly illustrate the outline of a once great lake and the delta that fed it. Enticing is the sliver of carbonate rocks that seem to mark what would have been the palaeo-lake's shoreline.""When we think of carbonates on Earth, we think of reefs and we think of shallow warm water,"" said Dr Stack Morgan.""We don't know that we're going to find reefs on Mars but we do think with these shallow waters where carbonates were precipitated, it could be that we had organisms that were making use of that carbonate just like we have here on Earth in shallow water environments.""  Curiosity has astonished us with its discoveries of river-worn pebbles and lake muds that point to periods of abundant water moving across Mars early in its history.But the veteran rover's instrumentation - frustratingly - can only grasp a coarse, or bulk, view of the chemistry that persisted at the time. It must crush up its samples before testing them. 2020, alternatively, will carry instruments that will be able to examine a rock's fine-scale textures while at the same time mapping the detailed elemental distribution within those textures.Indeed, everything about Mars 2020 should be regarded as a step up on what's gone before, believes Dr Bell.The Arizona scientist is leading on the main camera system that sits atop the rover's mast.       ""They look like the MastCams on Curiosity; they're in the same place. But unlike the Curiosity cameras, ours will zoom from wideangle all the way to telephoto. So, we'll collect a lot more stereo and 3D data. All that was possible with Curiosity, but it was a little more cumbersome. ""We also have microphones. We're hopeful that we'll be able to capture some of the sounds of entry, descent and landing; and some of the sounds of driving around, merging that sound with the video that we can take.""The rover has recently arrived at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to begin its final preparations for launch.

Mars mission readies tiny chopper for Red Planet flight,"Engineers preparing the next American Mars rover have installed one of its most exciting experiments - a chopper.The mini-helicopter is regarded as a bonus on the 2020 mission. It will be the first such aircraft deployed on another world. If it works, it'll be amazing, but if it doesn't it won't detract from the overall goals.The US space agency's (Nasa) next Mars rover is a near-copy of the one-tonne Curiosity vehicle that has operated successfully in Gale Crater since 2012.The new mission will be aimed at a different target - a 50km-wide depression called Jezero Crater.Engineers are nearing the end of the rover's assembly at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.They've positioned the 1.8kg ""Scout"" chopper under the big robot. The idea is that the rover will find a safe place to put the aircraft on the ground shortly after landing. That does mean, however, that the twin-rotor device must travel with some protection.The rover's touchdown mechanism uses rockets and these will kick up stones and dust. As a consequence, a shield is being fitted around the helicopter to deflect any debris.There are no scientific instruments on the solar-powered Scout. Its job is merely to demonstrate the practicality of flight on another planet.It will, though, carry a camera and researchers will certainly be interested in the pictures it takes to give context to the rover's exploration. Ultimately, however, small helicopters could become a regular feature of future missions, not just to do reconnaissance but to study the more hard-to-reach places such as cliffs, caves and deep ravines.Nasa recently approved a mission to put a helicopter on Titan, a moon of Saturn. Like the Earth and Mars, Titan has an atmosphere - a thick one - and can support aero-vehicles. The Mars 2020 mission launches in July next year. Its landing is scheduled for 18 February 2021.Although it looks just like Curiosity, the new rover has a separate suite of instruments to ask some different scientific questions.These include the most direct of all questions about Mars: is there, or has there ever been, life on the planet?The 1970s Viking landers aside, all previous surface missions have only really considered the issue of habitability. That is, they investigated only whether life might have found conditions favourable had it been present.Jezero Crater has some very interesting rocks that look from orbit as though they may have formed at the edge of a lake-sized body of water. The Mars 2020 rover will examine the chemistry of these rocks for evidence of past biology.Mission scientists have just returned from a trip to Western Australia where they visited some of the oldest traces of life on Earth.These are the 3.4-billion-year-old remnants of fossilised stromatolites - the carbonate mounds that were built by bacterial communities in calm waters, just like those found at the edge of a lake.The researchers wanted to get a feel for the kind of physical structures that can be left on ancient landscapes by microbial activity.The expedition to the Pilbara Outback included colleagues from Europe who have their own rover set for launch next year, also in July. This vehicle, known as Rosalind Franklin, completed its assembly at an Airbus factory in England on Tuesday. It has now been sent to a test centre in France. Like the American rover, Rosalind Franklin will search for life signs, but it will do this on a flat equatorial plain known as Oxia. Nasa launched a schools essay-writing competition on Wednesday to find an engaging name for its rover. The new name to replace ""Mars 2020"" will be announced in February, exactly a year before landing day.End of Youtube post  by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory",29 August 2019,science
One-fifth of Earth's ocean floor is now mapped,"We've just become a little less ignorant about Planet Earth.The initiative that seeks to galvanise the creation of a full map of the ocean floor says one-fifth of this task has now been completed.When the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project was launched in 2017, only 6% of the global ocean bottom had been surveyed to what might be called modern standards.That number now stands at 19%, up from 15% in just the last year.Some 14.5 million sq km of new bathymetric (depth) data was included in the GEBCO grid in 2019 - an area equivalent to almost twice that of Australia.It does, however, still leave a great swathe of the planet in need of mapping to an acceptable degree.""Today we stand at the 19% level. That means we've got another 81% of the oceans still to survey, still to map. That's an area about twice the size of Mars that we have to capture in the next decade,"" project director Jamie McMichael-Phillips told BBC News.The map at the top of this page illustrates the challenge faced by GEBCO in the coming years. Black represents those areas where we have yet to get direct echosounding measurements of the shape of the ocean floor. Blues correspond to water depth (deeper is purple, shallower is lighter blue). It's not true to say we have no idea of what's in the black zones; satellites have actually taught us a great deal. Certain spacecraft carry altimeter instruments that can infer seafloor topography from the way its gravity sculpts the water surface above - but this only gives a best resolution at over a kilometre, and Seabed 2030 has a desire for a resolution of at least 100m everywhere.Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons.They are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines.They are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water.This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a critical role in moving heat around the planet. And if you want to understand precisely how sea-levels will rise in different parts  of the world, good ocean-floor maps are a must.Much of the data that's been imported into the GEBCO grid recently has been in existence for some time but was ""sitting on a shelf"" out of the public domain. The companies, institutions and governments that were holding this information have now handed it over - and there is probably a lot more of this hidden resource still to be released.But new acquisitions will also be required. Some of these will come from a great crowdsourcing effort - from ships, big and small, routinely operating their echo-sounding equipment as they transit the globe. Even small vessels - fishing boats and yachts - can play their part by attaching data-loggers to their sonar and navigation equipment. One very effective strategy is evidenced by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which operates in the more remote parts of the globe - and that is simply to mix up the routes taken by ships.""Very early on we adopted the ethos that data should be collected on passage - on the way to where we were going, not just at the site of interest,"" explained BAS scientist Dr Rob Larter. ""A beautiful example of this is the recent bathymetric map of the Drake Passage area (between South America and Antarctica). A lot of that was acquired by different research projects as they fanned out and moved back and forth to the places they were going.""New technology will be absolutely central to the GEBCO quest. Ocean Infinity, a prominent UK-US company that conducts seafloor surveys, is currently building a fleet of robotic surface vessels through a subsidiary it calls Armada. This start-up's MD, Dan Hook, says low-cost, uncrewed vehicles may be the only way to close some of the gaps in the more out-of-the-way locations in the 2030 grid.He told BBC News: ""When you look at the the mapping of the seabed in areas closer to shore, you see the business case very quickly. Whether it's for wind farms or cable-laying - there are lots of people that want to know what's down there. But when it's those very remote areas of the planet, the case then is really only a scientific one.""    Jamie McMichael-Phillips is confident his project's target can be met if everyone pulls together.""I am confident, but to do it we will need partnerships. We need governments, we need industry, we need academics, we need philanthropists, and we need citizen scientists. We need all these individuals to come together if we're to deliver an ocean map that is absolutely fundamental and essential to humankind.""GEBCO stands for General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans. It is the only intergovernmental organisation with a mandate to map the entire ocean floor. The latest status of its Seabed 2030 project was announced to coincide with World Hydrography Day.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",21 June 2020,science
"Black women scientists missing from textbooks, study shows","Scientists featured in textbooks are predominantly white men, according to a study.US biology textbooks highlighted seven men for every woman scientist.And black women were not represented a single time in any of the works analysed.Based on the current rate, it will be centuries before the books used to teach undergraduate biology in the US match the diversity of their readers, say researchers.""We didn't see any, for instance, black women scientists across any textbook,"" said Dr Cissy Ballen of Auburn University in Alabama, US.The study analysed more than 1,000 scientific names featured in seven modern biology textbooks used to teach undergraduates entering science and medicine in the US.They ranged from historical figures such as Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel to contemporary scientists such as Jane Goodall.Overall, 13% of the scientists featured were women, while 6.7% were from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds.Previous research has shown the importance of diverse, relatable role models in science, said Dr Ballen.  ""Not to be able to see anyone like them in these kinds of fundamental textbooks that they're using, I think it would have a really negative effect,"" she said.There have been some gains in recent years, particularly where women and Asian men are concerned, said the researchers.Despite this, the scientists portrayed are not representative of their target audience, particularly among Asian and Hispanic women, while black woman were not represented at all. Textbook publishers are ""tasked with balancing an accurate portrayal of history while showcasing contemporary science that reflects a diverse population of learners"", they said.Biology is relatively gender diverse compared with other areas of science, such as physics. In the US, around 60% of biology graduates are women.Previous research has shown the number of women climbing the career ladder in science is ""disappointingly low"".The research is published in the Royal Society journal, Proceedings B.Follow Helen on Twitter.",24 June 2020,science
'Black neutron star' discovery changes astronomy,"Scientists have discovered an astronomical object that has never been observed before.It is more massive than collapsed stars, known as ""neutron stars"", but has less mass than black holes.Such ""black neutron stars"" were not thought possible and will mean ideas for how neutron stars and black holes form will need to be rethought.The discovery was made by an international team using gravitational wave detectors in the US and Italy.Charlie Hoy, a PhD student from Cardiff University, UK, involved in the study,  said the new discovery would transform our understanding.""We can't rule out any possibilities,"" he told BBC News. ""We don't know what it is and this is why it is so exciting because it really does change our field.""Mr Hoy is part of an international team working for the Ligo-Virgo Scientific Collaboration.The international group, which has strong UK involvement backed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council, has laser detectors several kilometres long that are able to detect minute ripples in space-time caused by the collision of massive objects in the Universe. The collected data can be used to determine the mass of those objects involved.Last August, the instruments detected the collision of a black hole 23 times the mass of our Sun with an object of 2.6 solar masses. That makes the lighter object more massive than the heaviest type of dead star, or neutron star, previously observed - of just over two solar masses. But it was also lighter than the lightest black hole previously observed - of around five solar masses.Astronomers have been searching for such objects in what they've come to call the ""mass gap"". Writing in the journal The Astrophysical Journal Letters, the research team believes that of all the possibilities, the object is most likely to be a light black hole, but they are not ruling out any other possibilities.Having collided with the large black hole, the object no longer exists. However, there should be further opportunities to learn more about these mass-gap objects from future collisions, according to Prof Stephen Fairhurst, also at Cardiff.""It is a challenge for us to determine what this is,"" he told BBC News. ""Is this the lightest black hole ever, or is it the heaviest neutron star ever?""If it is a light black hole then there is no established theory for how such an object could develop. But Prof Fairhurst's colleague, Prof Fabio Antonioni, has proposed that a solar system with three stars could lead to the formation of light black holes. His ideas are receiving increased attention following the new discovery.If, however, this new class of object is a heavy neutron star then theories for how they form may also need to be revised, according to Prof Bernard Schutz of the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany.""We don't know a lot about the nuclear physics of neutron stars. So, people who are looking at exotic equations that explain what goes on inside them might be thinking, 'maybe this is evidence that we can get much heavier neutron stars'.""Both black holes and neutron stars are thought to form when stars run out of fuel and die. If it is a very large star, it collapses to form a black hole, an object with such strong gravitational force that not even light can escape its grasp. If the starting star is below a certain mass, one option is for it to collapse into a dense ball composed entirely of particles called neutrons, which are found inside the heart of atoms. The material from which neutron stars are composed is so tightly packed that one teaspoonful would weigh 10 million tonnes.A neutron star also has powerful gravity pulling it together, but a force between the neutrons, caused by a quantum mechanical effect known as degeneracy pressure, pushes the particles apart, counteracting the gravitational force.Current theories suggest that the gravitational force would overcome the degeneracy pressure if the neutron star were much larger than two solar masses - and cause it to collapse into a black hole.According to Prof Nils Andersson of Southampton University, if the mystery object is a heavy neutron star then the theorists will have to rethink what goes on in these objects.""Nuclear physics is not a precise science where we know everything,"" he said. ""We don't know how nuclear forces operate under the extreme conditions you need inside a neutron star. So, every single current theory we currently have of what goes on inside of one has some uncertainty.""Prof Sheila Rowan, director of the University of Glasgow's Institute for Gravitational Research (IGR), said the discovery challenges current theoretical models.""More cosmic observations and research will need to be undertaken to establish whether this new object is indeed something that has never been observed before or whether it may instead be the lightest black hole ever detected.""Follow Pallab on Twitter",23 June 2020,science
