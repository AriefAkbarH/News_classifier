European contract signed for Moon mission hardware,"The European Space Agency has asked the aerospace company Airbus to build another service module for the Americans' Orion crew capsule.This contract, worth around €250m (£225m), is particularly noteworthy, however.That's because the hardware will be part of the mission that returns astronauts to the Moon's surface for the first time in 52 years.The European Service Module (ESM) can be thought of as the back end of Orion.It pushes the capsule through space, is responsible for its power supply and temperature control, and holds all the water and gases needed to sustain those riding onboard.The US space agency (Nasa) asked Esa to source Orion service modules to cement their ongoing partnership at the International Space Station (ISS) and to pull Europe into the missions that are planned to go beyond low-Earth orbit.Nasa has initiated what it calls the Artemis programme to go back to the lunar surface. The Esa/Airbus collaboration has already supplied a service module for the first of this project's missions, Artemis I.This will be an uncrewed test of Orion and its launch rocket, and is likely to take place in 2021.Artemis II will see astronauts board Orion for a loop around the Moon. An ESM for this flight is already under contract and in assembly. Artemis III will be the mission that attempts to make a landing. At the moment this is scheduled for 2024, and the newly contracted service module will be a key piece of mission hardware. The ESM's role will be to get Orion to the vicinity of the Moon and bring it safely back to Earth. Other components will be required for the descent and ascent phases of the surface operation. Airbus assembles the service modules at its Bremen facility in Germany.The design borrows heavily from the uncrewed cargo truck Europe used to run to the space station called the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV).At one time, Europe thought of adapting this truck into a human transportation system of its own, but ultimately baulked at the cost.Nonetheless, the performance and reliability of the ATV made it an ideal template for Orion's service module.Cylindrical in shape, the ESM is about 4m wide and tall, and weighs just over 13 tonnes. Airbus is now able to produce it at a substantially reduced cost. The contract for the very first module, signed in 2014, was valued at €390m.ESMs are given to the Americans as an in-kind contribution to cover the cost of European operations at the space station. But the clear hope from the European perspective is that the integral relationship built up on the capsule will eventually lead to an Esa astronaut being part of an Orion crew that goes to the Moon.The American capsules are developed by Lockheed Martin. Their procurement is separate to the commercial arrangement Nasa has with SpaceX and Boeing who are now contracted to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS. The agency merely purchases seats in these two US companies' vehicles, Dragon and Starliner. Orion, on the other hand, will be purchased, owned and operated by Nasa.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",26 May 2020,science
Space debris: Smart solutions sought to make orbital traffic safer,"The UK Space Agency (UKSA) wants to hear from anyone with novel ideas for how to track all the pieces of debris now moving in orbit.UKSA has £1m to dispense in grants for smart new solutions. There are about 900,000 redundant objects larger than 1cm circling overhead.Even the smallest items are capable of doing immense damage to, or even destroying, an operational satellite in a collision.The funding is designed to seed further entrants to the UK's burgeoning space start-up sector.  ""We're looking to support new companies that want to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to better exploit the data that's already out there,"" explained Jacob Geer, the UKSA's head of space surveillance and tracking (SST). ""But the second theme is around new ways to sense and track space objects - in low-Earth orbit (LEO) in particular, because it's in LEO that a lot of the new missions will be going,"" he told BBC News.  Britain has a long history in SST. RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire, for example, has been using radar to track space objects for more than 50 years. But as the amount of traffic overhead - especially commercial traffic - increases, ever more sophistication is needed to monitor and understand what's going on.Today, satellite operators will sometimes receive a warning that their hardware is at risk of a collision with another object. But this notification can often be either so imprecise in its detail or arrive so close to the moment of possible intersection that it's next to useless. With thousands of new satellites, large and small, to be launched in the coming decade, SST is a field that's ripe for new thinking.Under the UKSA funding stream to be announced on Tuesday, companies will be able to bid for a maximum grant award of £250,000.The international market for space surveillance and tracking has the potential to reach over £100m by 2035, analysts believe.The UKSA hopes that if British businesses are well represented in this sector, it will also give new satellite operators the confidence to choose this country as a base as well.""What's exciting here is that if we can get this right; if we can get some assurance about operating safely, it will enable companies to push the boundaries of innovation even further in the types of new missions they intend to launch. If we're able to give them that support, they'll want to come to, and work from, the UK,"" said Dr Alice Bunn, the UKSA's international director.Britain made space safety a priority for itself at the recent European Space Agency Ministerial Council, by pledging more money to the policy area than any other member state. This included a substantial contribution to the ADRIOS (Active Debris Removal/In orbit servicing) programme, which is backing the Swiss-led ClearSpace-1 mission to grab some old rocket hardware and pull it out of the sky.Britain is also involved in another debris-capture demonstration called ELSA-d organised by the Japanese start-up Astroscale.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",26 May 2020,science
Sir Richard Branson: Virgin Orbit rocket fails on debut flight,"Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit company has tried unsuccessfully to launch a rocket over the Pacific Ocean.The booster was released from under the wing of one of the UK entrepreneur's old jumbos which had been specially converted for the task.The rocket ignited its engine seconds later but an anomaly meant the flight was terminated early.Virgin Orbit's goal is to try to capture a share of the emerging market for the launch of small satellites.It's not clear at this stage precisely what went wrong but the firm had warned beforehand that the chances of success might be only 50:50.The history of rocketry shows that maiden outings very often encounter technical problems.""Test flights are instrumented to yield data and we now have a treasure trove of that. We accomplished many of the goals we set for ourselves, though not as many as we would have liked,"" said Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart. ""Nevertheless, we took a big step forward today. Our engineers are already poring through the data. Our next rocket is waiting. We will learn, adjust, and begin preparing for our next test, which is coming  up soon.""The company is sure to be back for another attempt pretty soon - depending on the outcome of the post-mission analysis. The second rocket is undergoing final integration at the company's Long Beach factory in California and could be ready to fly within weeks.Most publicity about Sir Richard's space activities has focussed on the tourist plane he is developing to take fare-paying passengers on joy rides above the atmosphere. His satellite-launch venture is entirely separate. Orbit is chasing the growing interest in small spacecraft that are being designed for telecommunications and Earth observation. New manufacturing techniques, often involving ""off-the-shelf"" components from the consumer electronics industry, mean these satellites can now be turned out for a fraction of their historic cost. But they need matching, inexpensive means of getting into space - and the air-launched system from Virgin Orbit is intended to meet this demand.Sunday's flight illustrated the basic launch concept. The 747, known as Cosmic Girl, left Mojave Air and Space Port to the north of Los Angeles shortly before midday Pacific time (19:00 GMT / 20:00 BST), carrying the rocket, dubbed LauncherOne, under its left wing. At 35,000ft (10km), just west of the Channel Islands, the jet unlatched the liquid-fuelled booster to let it go into freefall.LauncherOne ignited its NewtonThree engine four seconds later to start the climb to orbit. But it seems it didn't get very far.""LauncherOne maintained stability after release, and we ignited our first-stage engine, NewtonThree. An anomaly then occurred early in first-stage flight. We'll learn more as our engineers analyse the mountain of data we collected today,"" the company's Twitter feed reported.We appreciate that, Elon. We're excited about the data we were able to get today. https://t.co/7fNEIVUdWBEnd of Twitter post  by @Virgin_OrbitSir Richard was not in attendance, but he was following events very closely, Orbit executives said.

At 35,000ft (10km), just west of the Channel Islands, the jet unlatched the liquid-fuelled booster to let it go into freefall.LauncherOne ignited its NewtonThree engine four seconds later to start the climb to orbit. But it seems it didn't get very far.""LauncherOne maintained stability after release, and we ignited our first-stage engine, NewtonThree. An anomaly then occurred early in first-stage flight. We'll learn more as our engineers analyse the mountain of data we collected today,"" the company's Twitter feed reported.Sir Richard was not in attendance, but he was following events very closely, Orbit executives said. Although his space start-up is headquartered in California currently, he is keen to bring it to the UK also.Orbit is working through the possibilities with the US and British governments, the UK Space Agency and the local authorities in the southwest of England. Newquay Airport in Cornwall has been identified as an ideal location from which to base operations.Britain's enthusiasm is tied closely to that of its satellite manufacturing sector. The country is one of the biggest producers in the world of compact spacecraft. Will Whitehorn is president of the trade body UKSpace. He also initiated early design work on an air-launched rocket system when working for Sir Richard in the late 2000s.""Everyone's attention right now is on the astronauts launching this week on a SpaceX rocket, but from an industrial perspective [Virgin Orbit] is just as significant,"" he told BBC News. ""If the coronavirus has taught us anything it is that our world is changing and space is going to be a big part of that. We could put so much industry outside the atmosphere. Take just the example of server farms. We know we could put them in space to harness solar power. It all comes down to the cost of access to space and that will be revolutionised by this kind of system.""",25 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: 10 questions about the mission,"Elon Musk's company SpaceX is about to launch its space vehicle - the Crew Dragon - with astronauts onboard for the first time. Here, we answer some common questions about the mission.Nasa has been planning to hand over the transport of crew to the International Space Station (ISS) since the early 2000s. After the Columbia space shuttle broke up during its return to Earth in 2003, the space agency focused on developing a replacement spaceship that could travel to the Moon. Involving private firms in the transfer of crew and cargo to the ISS was a necessary step to afford that programme. In 2014, entrepreneur Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing were announced as winners of a Nasa contract for crew transport services. SpaceX is launching its spacecraft first; the Crew Dragon spacecraft will lift off on Wednesday atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.SpaceX is an American company that provides commercial and government launch services on its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. Entrepreneur Elon Musk founded the company in 2002, with the goal of reducing space transportation costs, enabling the colonisation of Mars. SpaceX was the first private company to routinely return rocket stages to Earth under propulsive power so they could be re-flown rather than being discarded. It has been conducting regular flights of cargo to the ISS, and will now aim to begin launching astronauts. Musk's company is also developing a bigger spacecraft to carry humans - called Starship - which could begin the process of settling Mars.Born in South Africa, Elon Musk made more than $160m from the sale of online payment service PayPal to eBay. His desire to see humanity become a true space-faring civilisation was a driving factor behind the founding of SpaceX. But he has also been involved in founding a variety of other companies such as the electric car manufacturer Tesla. He also conceived a project called Hyperloop, a high-speed transportation system using pods that travel through a system of tubes. His colourful personality and lifestyle made him the inspiration for Robert Downey Jr's interpretation of Marvel Comics character Tony Stark. Musk is no stranger to controversy: his tweets have triggered lawsuits and led to him being forced out as the chairman of Tesla (though he remained as CEO).Since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011, Nasa has been paying Russia tens of millions of dollars to launch its astronauts on the Soyuz spacecraft. The Crew Dragon launch from Florida marks the first launch of humans from US soil in nine years. As such, it is seen as crucial for restoring American prestige in human spaceflight. This will also be the first time a private company has launched astronauts into orbit.The Crew Dragon is the spacecraft that will transport astronauts to the ISS on Wednesday. It is a sleek evolution of the Dragon spacecraft which was built to ferry cargo to the orbiting outpost. The Crew Dragon is designed to carry a maximum of seven passengers, but Nasa flights will carry four, with the rest of the space taken up by supplies. It is equipped with thrusters that enable it to manoeuvre in space and will dock - or attach - to the space station under autonomous control. Unlike previous spacecraft designed for humans, the crew cabin features touchscreen controls in place of physical buttons.Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley are Nasa astronauts. They were selected in 2000 and have each flown to space twice on the space shuttle. They are among the most experienced members of Nasa's astronaut corps and both trained as test pilots - which has been critical for putting the new spacecraft through its paces. Hurley has spent a total of 28 days and 11 hours in space, while Behnken has accumulated a total of 29 days and 12 hours, including 37 hours of spacewalking time. Both men are also married to astronauts.Spacecraft designed to carry astronauts have to go through a process that ensures they can operate safely. This launch is essentially the final step in that validation process. Once in orbit, Behnken and Hurley will test the Crew Dragon's environmental control system, the displays and controls and the manoeuvring thrusters. They will monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station and will become members of the ISS crew. At the orbiting outpost, they will continue performing tests on the Crew Dragon along with other tasks related to the space station. When it's time to return to Earth, the Crew Dragon will parachute down into the Atlantic Ocean. The capsule and crew will then be recovered by a ship called Go Navigator.The Crew Dragon has a built-in abort system, designed to save the lives of its crew in the event of an emergency. If there's a problem during lift-off, such as a rocket engine cut-off, the Crew Dragon will fire engines to propel the vehicle and its occupants free of the rocket. The capsule will then parachute down to safety. SpaceX successfully conducted a test of its in-flight abort system on 19 January 2020.The flight suits that Behnken and Hurley will wear in the capsule look very different to previous designs. In stark contrast to the bulky pumpkin-coloured suits and round helmets familiar from the space shuttle era, SpaceX's suits are slimline, white, one-piece numbers with sleek, 3D-printed helmets. Each one is custom made for the astronaut. If they look like something from a science fiction movie, that's probably because their look was devised by Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez, who has worked on the Batman, X-Men and Thor movies. But the suits also have to be practical; they're designed to keep the crew alive in the event of a cabin depressurisation - where the air is lost from the inside of the spacecraft.If the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission is successful, SpaceX will proceed with the six ""operational"" missions to the ISS they are required to fly under their $2.6bn contract with Nasa. Boeing holds a similar deal, worth $4.2bn, to transport crew to the space station using its CST-100 Starliner vehicle.Follow Paul on Twitter.",23 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: What's the mission plan?,"On Wednesday, the California company SpaceX will launch a mission to the International Space Station (ISS). It's something the firm has done many times before, taking cargo to the sky-high laboratory. But on this occasion, the firm will be transporting people.It's one of those seminal moments in the history of spaceflight.When Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken lift off atop their Falcon-9 rocket, inside their Crew Dragon capsule, it will mark the first time humans have left US territory to reach low-Earth orbit in almost nine years. But more than that, it sees a shift to the commercialisation of human space transportation - of companies selling ""taxi"" rides to government and anyone else who wants to purchase the service.  This page details the key phases in the mission sequence.Launch will occur from the Kennedy Space Center's Complex 39A. This is the famous Florida pad from where the Apollo 11 moonwalkers and the very first shuttle, Columbia, also began their missions.Timing is precise. The Falcon must leave the ground at 16:33 EDT (20:33 GMT / 21:33 BST), or the astronauts won't be able to catch the ISS which passes overhead at 27,000km/h (17,000mph). Falcon-9 is a two-stage rocket. Its lower-segment will fire for 2.5 minutes before shutting down and separating. This will leave the second stage to burn for a further six minutes to get Dragon into orbit. Once detached, the capsule will then make the rest of the journey to the ISS using its own thrusters.The second stage of the rocket will be commanded to burn up in the atmosphere. The lower-segment of the booster aims to touch down on a drone ship in the Atlantic. This is a SpaceX speciality that sets its Falcon apart from all other orbital rockets in use today.It seems remarkable but Nasa astronauts have not had the use of a brand new spaceship design for 39 years. Not since John Young and Bob Crippen climbed aboard the Columbia orbiter. Their shuttle had dials, switches and a control stick. Dragon is all touchscreen. It's an automated vessel so it plots a path to ISS by itself, but Hurley and Behnken must practise manual flying in case there is some sort of anomaly.Dragon Capsule was conceived to handle every imagined scenario, including a failure of the rocket on the pad or in flight. If this happens, the ship will use a powerful in-built propulsion system to push itself to a safe distance. SpaceX has rehearsed this possibility both on the ground and in mid-air.This mission should see Dragon reach the ISS after about 19 hours of flight. The capsule will line itself up with the bow of the space station and approach at a relative speed of just a few centimetres per second. Once attached, hooks make an airtight seal.The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay aboard the 420km-high ISS is not yet fixed. It should be more than a couple of months but is unlikely to be longer than 120 days. Engineers say the solar cells on the Dragon degrade in orbit and so Nasa is sure to bring the crewmen home well before the hardware's performance is compromised.The descent to Earth won't be rushed. The astronauts plan a two-hour free-flight to further test onboard systems and procedures. When the de-orbit burn is eventually called, Dragon will be protected in its fall through the atmosphere by a heat shield. Four big parachutes will slow the spacecraft to a gentle splashdown in the Atlantic, just off the American coastline.SpaceX teams have gone over the process of retrieving the capsule many times.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",24 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Astronauts get to work ahead of historic flight,"Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have flown into the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare for their historic mission next week.The pair's trip to the International Space Station (ISS) will be made in a rocket and capsule system provided by a commercial company, SpaceX. Nasa has traditionally always owned and operated its space vehicles.But that is a capability it gave up in 2011 when it retired the last of the space shuttles.The agency now intends to contract out all future crew transportation to low-Earth orbit.  Hurley and Behnken flew into Florida from the agency's human spaceflight headquarters in Texas where they have been in quarantine. They'll continue protecting their health at Kennedy as they get ready for next Wednesday's planned lift-off.Thursday will see teams from SpaceX and Nasa hold a flight readiness review to confirm all preparation activities are good to proceed.The astronauts' rocket, a Falcon-9, and capsule, known as Dragon, will be wheeled out to the spaceport's famous launch pad - complex 39A - shortly for its static fire test. This will see the Falcon ignite briefly all nine of its first-stage engines to check they are fit to go. Hurley and Behnken, together with ground-support staff, will also conduct a ""crew dry dress"" rehearsal.This will involve the men suiting up, riding out to the pad and even climbing into their capsule as a dummy run to ensure everyone understands their role.Of the Dragon, Hurley said: ""It's just an amazing vehicle. It's definitely not the space shuttle. It's much smaller; it's a capsule. It's state-of-the-art from a technology standpoint, and we are so excited to be in a real spaceship and not the simulator here in just a week.""Behnken said the pair felt the weight of history. This is only the fifth time American astronauts will have flown to orbit in a brand new spacecraft design.""We certainly take inspiration from all those who've come before us. Whenever we've had a chance to speak with the astronauts who had those opportunities - the thing they've emphasised is, in the moment, being as prepared and ready for whatever may come your way as possible,"" he told reporters at Kennedy.Next week's launch is key moment in Nasa's strategy to change the way it conducts its space activity. Its commercial crew programme, initiated in 2010, selected both SpaceX and aerospace heavyweight Boeing to develop crew transportation services.The arrangement with the companies means they can also sell seats in their vehicles to other space agencies, companies or indeed wealthy individuals.""We are on the cusp of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil yet again,"" explained Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.   ""This time we're doing it differently than we've ever done it before. We are partnering with commercial industry with the intent that they would go get customers that are not Nasa, and drive down our costs and increase the access to space.""For the moment, this model only covers flights to a few hundred kilometres above the Earth, to the ISS. But eventually the aim is to extend the concept to operations in deeper space.In April, Nasa asked three teams to develop ideas for landing its astronauts on the Moon. Again, this would be a service the agency would purchase. Lift-off for Hurley and Behnken next Wednesday is scheduled for 16:33 local time (21:33 BST/20:33 GMT).",21 May 2020,science
Covid recovery could 'tip the balance' for nature,"Environmental scientists have called for the conservation of nature to be at the centre of the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.With countries still ensnared by the crisis, scientists have urged governments to make plans that ""safeguard biodiversity and human health"" as they rebuild. The researchers published an open letter in the journal Science.""How we emerge from lockdowns,"" they say, ""will drive a new world economy."" This is likely to have lasting effects on global biodiversity, the Australian authors argue.The right long-term plans, from governments and international organisations, could ""tip the balance"" in favour of nature. There are some striking examples of upheavals that have had unintended benefits for nature. The catastrophic nuclear accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine, and the resulting exclusion zone around the plant, created an unplanned wilderness that has since been designated an ecological reserve. ""The Colombia Conflict, for example, created unofficial protected areas,"" explained Dr Ryan Pearson from Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. ""This slowed environmental degradation because people were fearful of entering remote areas occupied by rebels.""The more recent ""post-conflict"" increase in deforestation there shows the need for longer-term strategies that can maintain the positive side effects of crises.""There have been many reports of wild animals increasing in numbers and turning up in places they haven't been seen i a long time,"" Dr Pearson told BBC News. "" This carries implications that certain species may be benefiting from the absence of human influence during lockdowns or possibly because of reduced pollution, especially in waterways.""We can't be sure how long such effects will last unless long-term strategies are implemented to encourage them.""There is, the scientists say, a concern that the rush to re-stabilise and grow economies may come ""at the expense of the environment"".This group of environmental scientists are adding their voices to a call for a greener focus as the world rebuilds. Dr Pearson added: ""We hope our letter will encourage positive strategies to support biodiversity into legislation, and the behaviour of people in their choices - in their consumption, investment, and travel.""Follow Victoria on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
Climate change: Top 10 tips to reduce carbon footprint revealed,"Climate change can still be tackled – but only if people are willing to embrace major shifts in the way we live, a report says.The authors have put together a list of the best ways for people to reduce their carbon footprints.The response to the Covid-19 crisis has shown that the public is willing to accept radical change if they consider it necessary, they explain.And the report adds that government priorities must be re-ordered.Protecting the planet must become the first duty of all decision-makers, the researchers argue.The authors urge the public to contribute by adopting the carbon-cutting measures in the report, which is based on an analysis of 7,000 other studies.Top of the list is living car-free, which saves an average of 2.04 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually. This is followed by driving a battery electric car - 1.95 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually - and taking one less long-haul flight each year - 1.68 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person.Switching to a vegan diet will help - but less than tackling transport, the research shows.It says popular activities such as recycling are worthwhile, but don’t cut emissions by as much.The lead author, Dr Diana Ivanova from Leeds University, told BBC News: “We need a complete change of mindset. “We have to agree how much carbon we can each emit within the limits of what the planet can bear – then make good lives within those boundaries.“The top 10 options are available to us now, without the need for controversial and expensive new technologies.” Dr Ivanova said the coronavirus lockdown has shown that many people could live without cars if public transport, walking and cycling were improved.Her research highlights rich people who typically take more flights, drive bigger cars and consume the most. She said: “All the world suffers from climate change, but it’s not the average person who flies regularly – it’s a small group, yet aviation is under-taxed. It’s a moral issue.”In her league table, buying renewable power and using public transport rank fourth and fifth.Sixth is insulating your home well, which saves 0.895 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.Seventh is switching to a vegan diet, which saves 0.8 tonnes. Other top actions are using heat pumps; switching from polluting cookstoves (in developing countries) to better methods of cooking, and heating buildings with renewable energy. Dr Ivanova said that if people implemented the measures, it would save around nine tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per person per year.Current annual household emissions are around 10 tonnes in the UK, and 17 in the US.The study, out soon in the journal Environmental Research Letters, says the following are worthwhile, but of lesser benefit to the climate: green roofs; using less paper; buying more durable items; turning down the thermostat - and recycling, which saves 0.01 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to Dr Ivanova.Some of the findings will be questioned. Polls suggest some people think climate is as important as the virus, for instance, but some don’t.Professor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “This is a valuable study. But it only looks at the carbon footprint and not at other impacts like water scarcity because of lithium mining for electric car batteries.Libby Peake, from the Green Alliance think tank, told BBC News: “People shouldn’t stop good habits like recycling, which saves some carbon while preventing waste and conserving resources.”  “Better design allows people to buy fewer but higher-quality things and to live in buildings with lower carbon footprints. These savings aren’t necessarily covered by this study.” Follow Roger on Twitter.",20 May 2020,science
Climate change: Scientists fear car surge will see CO2 rebound,"Daily global emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to Covid-19, say scientists.The most comprehensive account yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys. But the authors are worried that, as people return to work, car use will soar again.They fear CO2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis.They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real, durable changes on transport and personal mobility.In the UK, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged £250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure. Other countries are also looking at similar plans.The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to Covid-19 have had a significant impact on the carbon-producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do.Road transport has declined hugely, as has aviation. However, now that the UK is beginning to return to work, Mr Shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport, should walking or cycling not be an option.""If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than travelling by bus, train or tram,"" he said.Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed. Now in detailed analysis, researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of CO2.They've calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97% of global emissions.During the peak of the crisis in early April, daily emissions dropped by 17% compared to the previous year, meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day.The key to the fall has been cars. Surface transport emissions have declined by 43%, the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined. While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact, it only accounts for 10% of the decrease during the pandemic. China has been responsible for the biggest drop, followed by the US, Europe and India.If some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year, then global emissions will likely drop by 7%. If pre-pandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by mid-June, the annual fall would be around 4%. But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound, especially on the roads, could see a carbon surge.Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants, too. One of the UK's leading experts, Prof Frank Kelly, from King's College London, said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two years before US authorities exposed the scandal.He told Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road.Prof Kelly said he reported it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they didn't publish his findings. He said work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal action against car makers that had installed ""defeat devices"" to fool regulators.The government didn't deny the account. A spokesperson said: ""We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the World Health Organization as an 'example for the rest of the world to follow'"".Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 crisis, he said levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60% in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown.Levels of another pollutant, sooty particles, remained at harmful concentrations.""A big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work, and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before, once everybody goes back,"" said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia, who led the analysis.The researchers say that fundamental, systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change. When it comes to transportation, there are huge opportunities, according to Prof Le Quéré. She says that after the global financial crisis in 2008, some governments like China, US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables. ""Here now in 2020 we're very close to the same situation in electric mobility,"" she told BBC News.""Battery prices have come down, we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies.""""So if these two things can align, then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow.""Grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change. A letter signed by 155 major companies, representing $2.4 trillion (£1.96 trillion) in market capitalisation, calls for a net-zero emissions response to the covid crisis. Corporations including Carlsberg, Iberdrola, EDF and Coca Cola Europe say they want governments to ""prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy"".The authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action. They point to the fact that while emissions of CO2 may be temporarily reduced, all the while CO2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet.It will take a a dramatic shift to change that. ""I think very much that we are at a crossroads. And at this point, like the UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, it could go either way.""""He was talking about his own health, but here we're talking about the health of the planet.""""It could go either way.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Follow Matt on Twitter.",19 May 2020,science
Antarctic algal blooms: 'Green snow' mapped from space,"UK scientists have created the first wide-area maps of microscopic algae growing in coastal Antarctica.Satellite observations were used to count nearly 1,700 patches where large blooms had turned snow cover green.The team says the photosynthesising organisms are an important ""sink"" for pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.They are also key actors in the cycling of nutrients in what is one the most remote regions on Earth.""These are primary producers at the bottom of a food chain. If there are changes in the algae, it obviously has knock-on effects further up the food chain,"" explained study leader Dr Matt Davey from Cambridge University.""And even though the numbers we're talking about are small on a global scale, on an Antarctic scale they're substantially important,"" the ecologist, who has since joined the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban, told BBC News.Detecting the green algae from space was a tricky task. While it's easy to spot the organisms' discolouration when walking in the snow on the ground, from orbit it becomes much harder to tease out the blooms' signal against what is a highly reflective surface.Fortunately for the team, the European Union's Sentinel-2 spacecraft have high-fidelity detectors that are sensitive in just the right part of the light spectrum to make the observation. The study mapped the Antarctic Peninsula, the finger of land which points up from the White Continent towards South America. The blooms are seen predominantly to be on the western side of this feature. Two-thirds were on the many islands that dot the coastline. Totalled, the microscopic algae covered an area of almost 2 sq km. It means they're tying up roughly 500 tonnes of carbon a year. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon that would be emitted by about 875,000 average petrol car journeys in the UK, the team calculates.These numbers are an underestimate because the Sentinel-2 system is only picking up green algae and missing their red and orange counterparts - an issue of the satellite camera detectors' spectral bands not being sensitive at just the right wavelengths for those particular blooms.""It's frustrating because we've shown how to do it on the WorldView-3 spacecraft but its imagery is just too expensive. Sentinel is free,"" explained Dr Andrew Gray, who is affiliated to both Cambridge and the NERC Field Spectroscopy Facility in Edinburgh.The problem would be resolved in time as more open-data satellites were launched, the remote-sensing specialist added. Algal blooms in the Antarctic were first described by expeditions in the 1950s and 1960s. They can look spectacular when they tinge slopes with a broad swathe of colour to contrast the surrounding white. This makes them a popular subject for cruise ship tourists and their cameras.To flourish, the organisms need an available supply of liquid water and that's to be found in snowy areas just above freezing, as opposed to those places of deep cold and ice.The blooms' distribution is also heavily influenced by the proximity of seals, penguins and other Antarctic birds, such as skuas and kelp gulls. The ""poop"" from these creatures is a source of essential nitrogen and other elements. The interesting question is what happens to the blooms as the Antarctic warms. Temperatures on the peninsula rose rapidly in the latter half of the 20th Century, and climate models expect this trend to continue in coming decades.Many of the algal fields on low-lying islands could simply disappear if their snows are completely removed. On the other hand, new opportunities are likely to open up on the mainland, further to the south and at higher elevations.""There are probably many different species of algae, all with quite different niches. Some will live right at the top of the snow surface, others quite a bit deeper - and their numbers will change depending on the temperature,"" observed Prof Alison Smith, a biologist at Cambridge.       ""But we don't know yet whether their numbers will increase or decrease. And if you don't monitor the situation, you'll never know,"" she told BBC News.The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, involved additional team-members from the British Antarctic Survey and Edinburgh University.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",20 May 2020,science
Project seeks super view of Earth's mantle,"Some of the most sophisticated models of the Earth's interior ever constructed will be produced in a new project led from Cardiff University. Researchers want to simulate the behaviour of the mantle.This solid rock layer, which resides between the planet's core and crust, moves very slowly over time - roughly at the speed that a fingernail grows.The scientists will investigate its complex pattern of upwellings and downwellings.The team hopes its new circulation models will provide fresh insights into how the mantle has influenced the Earth's surface over hundreds of millions of years.""In the same way that the study of DNA has given us a whole new framework to understand biology, evolution and even this coronavirus we now face - so I want to look to the interior of the Earth to better understand how our planet, our single and sole 'spaceship', really works,"" project leader Prof Huw Davies told BBC News.Everyone is now familiar with plate tectonics - the description of how the rigid outer shell of our planet (its lithosphere) moves and is recycled.Great strides have been made in developing this theory in the 50 years since it came to prominence.For example, early ideas suggested the plates simply rode convection cells in the mantle like groceries on a supermarket check-out belt.   But we can now see that it's actually the weight of the ocean plates where they underthrust the continents that plays the major role in driving this remarkable system.Cold, dense rock at plate margins pulls on everything behind as it sinks into the mantle. And like the slinky dog that's started its journey downstairs, it needs little encouragement to maintain the momentum.Nonetheless, what goes down is coming back up because the heat of the interior has to be managed and redistributed.The new project will focus on the where and how of the upwellings, mapping the different regions of temperature, density, and velocity. Its supercomputer simulations will be constrained by state of the art knowledge in rock physics, chemistry and magnetism. Thanks to seismology, the study of how waves of energy from quakes move through the Earth, we have a very good picture of what the planet's interior looks like today. And the team's models, when they're run forwards and backwards, will have to reproduce this anchoring snapshot.The goal, says Prof Davies, is to get an accurate representation of behaviour back to about one billion years into the past.A key target is to understand the upwellings that ultimately result in ""hotspots"" at the Earth's surface - the places where there have been colossal outpourings of lava and gas through geologic history.""These are what we call the Large Igneous Provinces, or LIPs,"" explained Prof Davies. ""There hasn't been anything like this since the Columbia River flood basalts in North America just over 10 million years ago. So, they're rare. And thank goodness, because they can be absolutely catastrophic. ""The Siberian Traps which cover a large part of west Siberia match up with the largest extinction on Earth.

Social distancing: When extreme weather and coronavirus collide,"People being displaced by extreme weather events around the world are being forced to break Covid-19 social distancing safety guidelines, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and other humanitarian agencies.“Social distancing is no longer possible when displaced people are in evacuation centres,” Marshal Makavure, emergency operations co-ordinator of IFRC in Eastern Africa told the BBC.“People have been forced to break the Covid-19 protocol and guidelines under such circumstances.”The BBC has spoken with people living in areas affected by extreme weather events.Subrat Kumar Padhihary, a 38-year-old farmer in Odisha state on India’s east coast, is worried.Indian officials are on alert as Cyclone Amphan, due to hit West Bengal and Odisha on Wednesday, looks likely to intensify into a ""very severe"" storm.Subrat’s village is nearly 40 kilometres from the sea. The house that he shares with his wife, three daughters and mother was badly damaged by Cyclone Fani last year, so he isn’t convinced it can withstand Cyclone Amphan.But even if his house survives, he’s worried about having to leave his village if the authorities say people must evacuate.Subrat feels that might be even more dangerous.“My fear is that we will be taken to nearby schools that have already been turned into Covid-19 quarantine shelters.“There are not many centres in our village, and that means we will have to share the space with people [who may have Covid-19] which will be full of risks.”“West Bengal state has been struggling with Covid-19 cases and that is a cause of concern when it comes to cyclone preparedness,” according to Siddarth Srinivas, food and climate policy lead for Oxfam in Asia.“In the past, some states in India have rescued people by sheltering them in schools and public buildings, but this time doing that is not ideal because of the pandemic.”The Kasese district in western Uganda has been one of the worst hit by recent floods, with hundreds of people displaced.Joseline Kabugho is six months pregnant. The 23 year old has been forced to shelter with her two children in one of the school-turned-camps in the district.She’s staying at the shelter, even though her pregnancy means she is in a high-risk group when it comes to Covid-19 infection. There are nearly 200 displaced people with her at the shelter.“We are so vulnerable now,” she said from a class shared with three other families, which is now her family’s temporary home. “I can’t stay away from other people because of the limited space.“I am worried that I may get the virus, and I am worried about my kids, and my unborn baby,” she told the BBC.Joseline was sleeping next to her two children on the night of 7 May, when she heard other people in her village screaming.“I realised later on that my neighbours were actually telling me to run for my life. The entire village had been hit by a massive flood.“I grabbed my two kids and ran away, I had no time to take anything else.""She had bought some clothes for her unborn baby before the floods. “I could not even save those clothes. The floods took them all.“Whatever we had was swept away.""Her husband works in another district and he has been unable to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions. “I have nowhere to go and I don’t know what to do next.”Relief workers with the Red Cross say thousands of people are now sheltering in churches and schools in flood-hit East Africa with limited access to water and soap.Hundreds have died and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the floods in more than a half a dozen countries.More than 2,700 Covid-19 deaths and nearly 82,000 confirmed cases have been recorded in Africa, according to John Hopkins University.Among the flood affected countries in East Africa, Somalia has the highest death figure of 55, followed by 50 in Kenya and 21 in Tanzania.Tropical cyclone Harold hit Pacific island countries more than a month ago.Some affected countries had to lift Covid-19 restrictions to allow people to take refuge in evacuation centres. Some people are still in evacuation centres now because the pandemic is affecting aid efforts.The worst-hit country, Vanuatu, has extended the state of emergency as more than 92,000 people have been affected, according to Unicef.In Fiji, about 10 evacuation centres are operating because recovery has been very slow and many houses are yet to be rebuilt.“Access to water is still a big challenge as the cyclone has destroyed water supply infrastructures,” said Vani Catanasiga, director of Fiji Council of Social Services.“Without adequate water supply, following Covid-19 hygiene guidelines is very difficult, although the Fijian government has been successful in flattening the Covid-19 infection curve.”Humanitarian agencies say relief operations can help in enforcing Covid-19 guidelines.Red Cross relief worker Irene Nakasiits is distributing water and soap as essentials to the flood-displaced communities in western Uganda.“Although it is challenging to do so, we can still remind affected communities to follow the guidelines,” according to Marshal Mukuvare of the IFRC.“We can have messages written on food and other relief materials, which we distribute in affected places.“This helps people do what they can, even in such adverse conditions.”It’s uncharted territory, according to Siddarth Srinivas, Food and Climate policy lead for Oxfam in Asia. “When it comes to how to deal with extreme weather and a pandemic like Covid-19, the debate has just started.“It needs much more thinking before we come up with solid measures.”  ",20 May 2020,science
Space Plane: Mysterious US military aircraft launches,"The US Air Force has successfully launched its Atlas V rocket, carrying a X-37B space plane for a secretive mission.The rocket launched on Sunday from Cape Canaveral, a day after bad weather halted plans for a Saturday launch. The aircraft, also known as an Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), will deploy a satellite into orbit and also test power-beaming technology.It is the plane's sixth mission in space. The launch was dedicated to front line workers and those affected by the pandemic. A message including the words ""America Strong"" was written on the rocket's payload fairing. X-37B is a classified programme and United Launch Alliance, which operates the Atlas rocket, was required to end its webcast earlier in the flight than it would normally do.The Pentagon has revealed very few details about the reusable vehicle's missions and capabilities in the past, but Secretary of the Air Force, Barbara Barrett, said earlier this month: ""This X-37B mission will host more experiments than any other prior mission.""It's known that one of the onboard experiments will test the effect of radiation on seeds and other materials. The X-37B programme started in 1999. The vehicle (the project has two) resembles a smaller version of the crewed space shuttles that were retired by the US space programme in 2011. It can glide back down through the atmosphere to land on a runway, just as the shuttle did. Built by Boeing, the plane uses solar panels for power in orbit, measures over 29ft (9m) long, has a wingspan of nearly 15ft and a weight of 11,000lbs (5,000kg).The first plane flew in April 2010 and returned after an eight-month mission. The most recent mission ended in October 2019, after 780 days in orbit, bringing the X-37B programme's time in space to more than seven years.The length of this latest mission is currently unclear.

'Billions of years of evolutionary history' under threat,"Scientists say more than 50 billion years of cumulative evolutionary history could be lost as humans push wildlife to the brink.""Weird and wonderful"" animals unlike anything else on Earth are sliding silently toward extinction, they say.And regions home to the greatest amounts of unique biodiversity are facing unprecedented human pressures.They include the Caribbean, Western Ghats of India and large parts of Southeast Asia. The study, published in Nature Communications, highlights priority species for conservation, based on their evolutionary distinctiveness.""These species are weird and wonderful and there is nothing like them on Earth,"" said Rikki Gumbs of ZSL's EDGE of Existence programme and Imperial College London.He said the analysis reveals ""the incomprehensible scale of the losses we face if we don't work harder to save global biodiversity"".The researchers calculated the amount of evolutionary history - branches on the tree of life - that are currently threatened with extinction, using extinction risk data for more than 25,000 species. They found a combined 50 billion years of evolutionary heritage, at least, were under threat from human impacts such as urban development, deforestation and road building.Animals at risk include tapirs and pangolins, which have ancient lineages and have changed little over time; and fascinating little-known reptiles, from legless lizards to tiny blind snakes.Many carry out vital functions in the habitats in which they live. For example, tapirs in the Amazon disperse seeds in their droppings that can help regenerate the rainforest. And pangolins, which are specialist eaters of ants and insects, play an essential role in balancing the food web.Co-researcher Dr James Rosindell, from Imperial College London, UK, said the findings highlight the importance of acting urgently to conserve these extraordinary species and the remaining habitat that they occupy, ""in the face of intense human pressures"".New goals for protecting the natural world are due to be agreed in October in what was set to be a critical year for nature.Conservation groups say the pandemic has disrupted conservation work and funding, with potential repercussions for years to come, but we can seize the opportunity to push for stronger action to protect the natural world.Last year an intergovernmental panel of scientists said one million animal and plant species were now threatened with extinction.Follow Helen on Twitter.",26 May 2020,science
European contract signed for Moon mission hardware,"The European Space Agency has asked the aerospace company Airbus to build another service module for the Americans' Orion crew capsule.This contract, worth around €250m (£225m), is particularly noteworthy, however.That's because the hardware will be part of the mission that returns astronauts to the Moon's surface for the first time in 52 years.The European Service Module (ESM) can be thought of as the back end of Orion.It pushes the capsule through space, is responsible for its power supply and temperature control, and holds all the water and gases needed to sustain those riding onboard.The US space agency (Nasa) asked Esa to source Orion service modules to cement their ongoing partnership at the International Space Station (ISS) and to pull Europe into the missions that are planned to go beyond low-Earth orbit.Nasa has initiated what it calls the Artemis programme to go back to the lunar surface. The Esa/Airbus collaboration has already supplied a service module for the first of this project's missions, Artemis I.This will be an uncrewed test of Orion and its launch rocket, and is likely to take place in 2021.Artemis II will see astronauts board Orion for a loop around the Moon. An ESM for this flight is already under contract and in assembly. Artemis III will be the mission that attempts to make a landing. At the moment this is scheduled for 2024, and the newly contracted service module will be a key piece of mission hardware. The ESM's role will be to get Orion to the vicinity of the Moon and bring it safely back to Earth. Other components will be required for the descent and ascent phases of the surface operation. Airbus assembles the service modules at its Bremen facility in Germany.The design borrows heavily from the uncrewed cargo truck Europe used to run to the space station called the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV).At one time, Europe thought of adapting this truck into a human transportation system of its own, but ultimately baulked at the cost.Nonetheless, the performance and reliability of the ATV made it an ideal template for Orion's service module.Cylindrical in shape, the ESM is about 4m wide and tall, and weighs just over 13 tonnes. Airbus is now able to produce it at a substantially reduced cost. The contract for the very first module, signed in 2014, was valued at €390m.ESMs are given to the Americans as an in-kind contribution to cover the cost of European operations at the space station. But the clear hope from the European perspective is that the integral relationship built up on the capsule will eventually lead to an Esa astronaut being part of an Orion crew that goes to the Moon.The American capsules are developed by Lockheed Martin. Their procurement is separate to the commercial arrangement Nasa has with SpaceX and Boeing who are now contracted to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS. The agency merely purchases seats in these two US companies' vehicles, Dragon and Starliner. Orion, on the other hand, will be purchased, owned and operated by Nasa.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",26 May 2020,science
Space debris: Smart solutions sought to make orbital traffic safer,"The UK Space Agency (UKSA) wants to hear from anyone with novel ideas for how to track all the pieces of debris now moving in orbit.UKSA has £1m to dispense in grants for smart new solutions. There are about 900,000 redundant objects larger than 1cm circling overhead.Even the smallest items are capable of doing immense damage to, or even destroying, an operational satellite in a collision.The funding is designed to seed further entrants to the UK's burgeoning space start-up sector.  ""We're looking to support new companies that want to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to better exploit the data that's already out there,"" explained Jacob Geer, the UKSA's head of space surveillance and tracking (SST). ""But the second theme is around new ways to sense and track space objects - in low-Earth orbit (LEO) in particular, because it's in LEO that a lot of the new missions will be going,"" he told BBC News.  Britain has a long history in SST. RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire, for example, has been using radar to track space objects for more than 50 years. But as the amount of traffic overhead - especially commercial traffic - increases, ever more sophistication is needed to monitor and understand what's going on.Today, satellite operators will sometimes receive a warning that their hardware is at risk of a collision with another object. But this notification can often be either so imprecise in its detail or arrive so close to the moment of possible intersection that it's next to useless. With thousands of new satellites, large and small, to be launched in the coming decade, SST is a field that's ripe for new thinking.Under the UKSA funding stream to be announced on Tuesday, companies will be able to bid for a maximum grant award of £250,000.The international market for space surveillance and tracking has the potential to reach over £100m by 2035, analysts believe.The UKSA hopes that if British businesses are well represented in this sector, it will also give new satellite operators the confidence to choose this country as a base as well.""What's exciting here is that if we can get this right; if we can get some assurance about operating safely, it will enable companies to push the boundaries of innovation even further in the types of new missions they intend to launch. If we're able to give them that support, they'll want to come to, and work from, the UK,"" said Dr Alice Bunn, the UKSA's international director.Britain made space safety a priority for itself at the recent European Space Agency Ministerial Council, by pledging more money to the policy area than any other member state. This included a substantial contribution to the ADRIOS (Active Debris Removal/In orbit servicing) programme, which is backing the Swiss-led ClearSpace-1 mission to grab some old rocket hardware and pull it out of the sky.Britain is also involved in another debris-capture demonstration called ELSA-d organised by the Japanese start-up Astroscale.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",26 May 2020,science
