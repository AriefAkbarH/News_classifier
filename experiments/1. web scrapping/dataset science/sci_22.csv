Fossil tracks left by an ancient crocodile that 'ran like an ostrich',"Scientists have been stunned to find that some ancient crocodiles might have moved around on two feet.The evidence comes from beautifully preserved fossil tracks in South Korea.Nearly a hundred of these 18-24cm-long indentations were left in what were likely the muddy sediments that surrounded a lake in the Early Cretaceous, 110-120 million years ago.The international team behind the discovery says it will probably challenge our perception of crocodiles. ""People tend to think of crocodiles as animals that don't do very much; that they just laze around all day on the banks of the Nile or next to rivers in Costa Rica. Nobody automatically thinks I wonder what this [creature] would be like if it was bipedal and could run like an ostrich or a T. rex,"" Martin Lockley, an emeritus professor at the University of Colorado, US, told BBC News.The study is sure to provoke a lively debate. Not all researchers will necessarily accept the team's interpretation. Prof Lockley and colleagues have assigned the name Batrachopus grandis to the animal that made the tracks, although no physical remains of it have yet been uncovered.The acknowledgement of the creature's existence rests solely on the fossil prints themselves. These look very similar in shape, albeit much larger, to those made by Batrachopus crocs that lived tens of millions of years earlier in the Jurassic. Except those older beasts very evidently were quadrupeds - they did walk on all fours. A bipedal interpretation for the new Korean trace fossils is the only explanation, claims Prof Lockley.""We can see all the digits, all the ridges in the skin - just as if you were looking at your hands,"" he explained. ""They put one foot in front of another; they could pass a sobriety test walking on a straight line. And there are no front footprints.""The depth of the impressions made by the heel also supports the idea of a more upright posture, said team-leader Prof Kyung Soo Kim from South Korea's Chinju National University of Education.""Our trackways are very narrow-looking - more like a crocodile balancing on a tight-rope,"" he remarked.""When combined with the lack of any tail-drag marks, it became clear that these creatures were moving bipedally.""They were moving in the same way as many dinosaurs, but the footprints were not made by dinosaurs. Dinosaurs and their bird descendants walk on their toes.""Crocodiles walk on the flat of their feet leaving clear heel impressions, like humans do.""For Prof Lockley, the new prints also help re-interpret a South Korean trackway he and other colleagues described eight years ago. In 2012, this group thought a set of less-well defined and slightly younger indentations might have been left by giant versions of the flying reptiles known as pterosaurs. These animals are broadly recognised to have shuffled forwards when on the ground using their feet and hands - rather like a bat. This enigmatic trackway, however, had looked bipedal - perhaps the consequence of a pterosaur wading through water with just its feet in contact with the sediment.Prof Lockley now believes this trackway was also very probably a bipedal Batrachopus.Prof Phil Manning from the University of Manchester, UK, was not part of the discovery team. As a fossil trackway specialist himself, he described the prints as ""very interesting"" and welcomed their publication to begin a discussion - but he doubted the interpretation.""For me, the tracks just don't fit the overall geometry a crocodilian and what it's capable of producing,"" he told BBC News.""Look at any videos of living crocs and the rotation of their feet when they're galloping: it's outwards, not inwards towards the midline of the trackway. Just from their orientation, it looks more like some kind of dinosaurian track-maker to me. But whether it's a croc - unfortunately, we just don't have the fossil bones to tell us.""The tracks of Batrachopus grandis are reported in the journal Scientific Reports.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",11 June 2020,science

Planet's satellites aim for still sharper view of Earth,"When SpaceX puts up another batch of its Starlink satellites in the coming days, there'll be three spacecraft from the Planet company catching the same Falcon rocket ride to orbit.These companies - SpaceX and Planet - now operate the largest commercial constellations above our heads. SpaceX at over 450 satellites; Planet at more than 150.SpaceX is targeting broadband communications; Planet is all about Earth observation, and this next launch marks a big milestone in the San Francisco outfit's plans.These next three platforms that go up with SpaceX will go into Planet's SkySat network. Already this comprises 15 spacecraft. The satellites were lowered in recent months from 500km in altitude to 450km, to increase their resolution. They now see any feature on the Earth's surface larger than 50cm.With the addition of the soon-to-launch threesome, and a further three about a month later, Planet will then have 21 of the high-resolution imagers circling the globe. At that point, the SkySats will be able to see any spot on the ground (cloud permitting) on average up seven times a day.And mid-latitudes - eg, the UK - will be in a particular sweetspot. Super-sharp pictures will be available up to 12 times a day. No other network comes close to this in terms of repeat visit at 50cm resolution. And with Planet's ""string of pearls"" small sats, called Doves, which picture the entire Earth's surface once a day at 3.7m resolution - the company is now very much in the era of ""constant watch"".""They're both cool systems,"" says Will Marshall, the British CEO and co-founder of Planet. ""The Doves scan the Earth and are used to monitor large-scale phenomena, such as for agriculture and deforestation; while the SkySats are for pointing and tasking, where you need higher resolution imagery for things like making maps, hence our partnership with Google.""Planet is now updating the portal, or Dashboard, that customers use to order the imagery they want. It's taking the human out of the loop. Where previously a staffer at the company would pick up the request and task the satellite, the Dashboard will in future do the job directly.""Google is working on these self-healing maps where if anyone notices a map is out of date, it will automatically trigger a new SkySat collect that will bring a new image down, automatically recognise the buildings and roads and then automatically bring the map up to date. We want to enable that kind of 'tips' system and the automated provision of imagery to more people than just the very sophisticated clients like Google,"" Dr Marshall told BBC News.There is an astonishing amount of data now being returned by Earth observation (EO) satellites. The archives of the big space agencies and companies are filling up with petabytes of information (one petabyte is roughly equivalent to 200,000 commonly used DVDs).Optical and near-infrared imagery (essentially, what we see with our eyes and just beyond at the longer wavelengths of light) is the cornerstone of EO, and increasingly it will feature in everyday applications on the web and on people's smartphones.The future will be in using all this information in ever smarter ways; in using machine learning to pull out yet more relevant insights into the changes taking place across the surface of the globe. Planet's current 150 shoebox-sized Doves are being superseded by a new generation of small satellites that double, from four to eight, the number of colour bands recorded on their camera sensors. More than 20 of these new ""Super Doves"" will go up next week on a European Vega rocket. Dr Marshall says Planet is in a state of constant iteration, exploiting the very latest processors, sensors, radios, and other component technologies to push the satellites' capabilities. Spacecraft are launched and retired at a high cadence.""Just as you don't what a smartphone in your pocket that's older than three years, we don't want spacecraft in orbit older than three years,"" he said.""I definitely think this is Earth observation's moment,"" he added. ""We're moving towards this concept of a queryable Earth."" Dr Marshall told BBC News: ""We have cool satellites, and it's fun to talk about them. And, obviously, it gets me excited as a space geek. ""But this is an information business. This is about providing insights that help people to make decisions, and that's what matters. ""Most of our users don't care what satellite the information comes from or how it got to them. They just care about how it helps them - as a farmer to help them optimise and reduce the amount of fertiliser on their land; or as a civil government to monitor regulations and enforcement; or as a coast guard to help stop illegal fishing.""We're trying to make EO easier and easier... to democratise its use and get benefit from it.""",9 June 2020,science

Could the coronavirus crisis finally finish off coal?,"The coronavirus crisis has changed the way we use energy, at least for now. But could the global pandemic finally finish off coal, the most polluting of all fossil fuels?The Covid-19 crisis has been an extraordinary and terrifying time for us all, but it has been a fascinating period to cover environmental issues.We've all enjoyed the unusually clean air and clear skies. They are the most obvious evidence that we have been living through a unique experiment in energy use.Locking hundreds of millions of us down in our homes around the world has led to an unprecedented fall in energy demand, including for electricity.And that has, in turn, revealed something very striking about the economics of the energy industry: the underlying vulnerability of coal, the fuel that powered the creation of the modern world.Like a tide withdrawing, the Covid-19 crisis has exposed just how fragile the financial foundations of this dirtiest of all fossil fuels have become.Some industry observers are even saying that coal may never recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Let's look at the evidence stacking up around the world.Britain's electricity grid will not have burnt any coal for 60 days - as of midnight on Wednesday 10 June. That is by far the longest period since the Industrial Revolution began more than 200 years ago.  When I spoke to the National Grid, they said they weren't expecting a coal generator to be turned back on anytime soon.In the US, more energy was consumed from renewables than from coal for the first time ever this year, despite President Donald Trump's efforts to support the industry. By contrast, only a decade ago, almost half of US electricity came from coal.Even in India, one of the fastest growing users of coal, demand for the fuel has fallen dramatically, helping deliver the first reduction in the country's carbon dioxide emissions for 37 years.The proximate cause is the lockdown. But what has been fascinating energy economists is that coal has overwhelmingly borne the brunt of the collapse in electricity demand.And this is a global phenomenon.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), we have seen the largest worldwide decline in coal consumption since World War Two.Only renewables have managed to hold their ground, says Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA.The trend was underway even before the coronavirus pandemic. Last year saw the largest fall in coal-powered electricity production on record worldwide.  What is striking is the shift away from the fuel isn't down to the efforts of well-meaning environmentalists - though they have played a role.The key issue is what economists call the ""marginal cost"" of different sources of energy.The idea is simple: once you've built your power stations, it is more expensive to run those that require fuel than ones that rely on wind, rain or sunshine.Think about it. You need to keep buying coal to burn. But once you have installed your wind turbine, solar panel or hydropower plant, the electricity it produces comes pretty much free of charge.Adding momentum is the fact that renewables are now often cheaper to build than new coal. And every year they are getting cheaper still.This month, the Indian government put out a tender for round-the-clock electricity supply, and the price for solar with battery storage was lower than the price for power generated from coal, says energy analyst Sunil Dahiya.If that is replicated around the world, then coal is dead.Think of it like a ratchet.If electricity demand rises, then in more and more countries the cheapest energy plant to build is renewables.But if there is a sudden shortfall in electricity demand - because of a pandemic, or just because a windy day produces more electricity than expected - then it's the coal-fired power station that gets switched off. Now imagine you are an investor considering splashing out on a new coal plant. Typically, you would expect it to operate for 30, even 40 years.Do you really want to make that investment knowing that every passing year it is likely to spend more and more time sitting idle, at the whim of the weather forecast? Thought not.And now add into your calculation the knowledge that the voice of the clean energy lobby is only going to grow in volume and force.After all, coal is the biggest carbon emitter of all fuels, and it also fills our air with carcinogenic particles and toxic chemicals - none of which is currently priced into the cost of burning the stuff.Many countries already give renewables priority access to their electricity grids. And it is not just new coal investments that look set to be squeezed out of the market. According Mr Dahiya, the virus has revealed the fact that much of the Indian coal industry is already effectively bankrupt.""Our coal-based power plants are operating at less than 60% of capacity"", he told me. ""They can't pay back the money they have been lent.""No surprise then that international investors are fleeing the sector.In the last few weeks, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund - the world's biggest - and the French bank BNP Paribas have joined financial giants like Blackrock, Standard Chartered and JP Morgan Chase to blacklist coal investments.What that means, says the IEA's Mr Birol, is that increasingly it will be governments that decide the future of coal.He urges them to continue to support renewables and shun coal investments.But here the picture is less bright.Coal plays a big part in China's latest five-year plan, with a potential 20% increase in the size of the coal sector.It is also helping fund coal-fired power stations in many developing countries as part of the so-called belt and road initiative.In India, the government is finalising a multi-billion-dollar coronavirus stimulus package that will include assistance for some parts of the coal sector.Which leaves us in a strange limbo.Global coal consumption may well have peaked in 2019, say many analysts, but the fuel is likely to wheeze on into the 2030s.Not an encouraging idea for anyone anxious about the world's climate.So here is a final thought for you.Governments don't face the same pressure to make money as companies, but they rarely want to subsidise failing industries forever - especially very polluting ones.Follow Justin on Twitter.",9 June 2020,science
Five key questions about energy after Covid-19,"The pandemic has seen carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fall as fossil fuel use has collapsed. But will these changes be permanent?From electricity giveaways to the virtual end of fracking, the global lockdown has seen huge changes in the way we create and consume energy.Carbon emissions have dropped dramatically and the air is clearer over major cities as car traffic has disappeared. But as demand for energy picks up once again, there are some large, unresolved questions about how we power our lives in the years to come. Many experts believe this is the moment to shift our power generation and transport system to sustainable, climate-friendly alternatives. To get to that place, some key questions need to be resolved. One of the most extreme changes brought about by the Covid-19 crisis is the glimpse it has given us of how our electricity systems might work in years to come.  An important aspect of that is the idea, seen during the pandemic, that there are times when consumers are paid to use energy. During the coronavirus lockdown, electricity consumption was down across Europe by around 15%. But because of a very sunny and windy spring, supplies of renewable energy boomed.Wholesale electricity across Europe is priced on an hourly basis for the day ahead, so abundant supplies and weak demand saw prices go below zero at times. Negative prices were once a rarity, but they plunged into the negative 66 times in April in the UK.  On Tuesday 21 April, UK prices were in the negative from 09:00 to 16:00. They dipped to just under minus £84 per Megawatt hour at one o'clock. For grid operators worried about too much power in the system, it's often easier for them to pay customers to use the power than to shut down the generators.Consumers who had signed up to flexible, real time tariffs with one UK energy supplier found themselves encouraged to use electricity when it went negative.""You're doing a service to the National Grid,"" says Greg Jackson from Octopus Energy, the company who encouraged their customers to use more during negative pricing episodes. ""The grid is going to pay someone to deal with this problem of oversupply. They will pay a company to build batteries, or they will pay companies to stop generating or you can pay customers to use electricity at those times.""""These are all different ways of providing the service of balancing the grid.""On that April Tuesday, Octopus Energy customers were getting around 4p per unit of electricity they used. Not a fortune, but perhaps a sign of things to come.The transition to a greener future means that grids will face huge influxes of power from intermittent suppliers, while demand will probably fall. Flexible pricing will likely remain a feature. ""This is a clear signal that the era of big, centralised 'base-load' generation is over, and that the future will be powered by renewables, energy storage and flexible power plants,"" said Björn Ullbro, from Wärtsilä Energy Business, a power sector company. So how have the grids coped with conditions during the Covid-19 crisis that many believed wouldn't occur for years?""Much better than I would have ever thought they would,"" is the verdict of Dave Jones, an electricity analyst with climate change think tank, Ember.""Across Europe, they're coping remarkably well. They have less of an isolated electricity system because they have interconnectors, so you don't have quite the same highs and lows as you do within the UK."" ""But faced with this, and the challenges of staff getting ill and having to go off into isolation, just keeping the lights on and keeping the electricity system operating through this is a minor miracle in itself.""One of the most significant potential outcomes from the Covid-19 crisis has been the disruption to shale oil drilling in many parts of the US.Hydraulic fracturing or fracking has become the main plank of a massive shift in US energy production over the past decade. Fracking uses of a mixture of water, sand and chemicals under high pressure to crack open oil- and gas-bearing rocks.When combined with horizontal drilling technology, production of oil and gas soared.According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2019, shale oil accounted for 63% of America's total crude oil production. Shale even saw the US become the world's number one exporter of oil for a brief period last year.But the coronavirus pandemic and the consequent drop in demand for oil has hit fracking very hard indeed.According to EIA figures, the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the US has fallen by 56%. In the Permian basin, North America's largest shale region, the number of rigs fell from 405 in March to 175 in early May.So does this dramatic drop signal the end of fracking?""People have called doom on the fracking industry many times,"" said Bethany McLean, an author and expert on the business. ""But there are a few things that are different right now.""""I do think oil production will be significantly lower than it was because I don't think the capital is going to return to the degree that it did in the past.""""And I think public market investors are disillusioned with the sector."" ""But to call the death of fracking, just because the economics don't work, might be going too far.""One major factor that might help revive the fracking industry after Covid-19 is politics.President Trump has so far shown little interest in bailing out fracking directly. His administration has been more focused on supporting Saudi Arabia and Russia in their efforts to cut oil production and drive up prices. But higher oil prices may hit US consumers at the petrol pump. Not a great idea in an election year.""Right now, when oil is such a significant part of US industry, especially in Republican states, it is very challenging for the government,"" said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, an oil market analyst with Rystad Energy in Oslo, Norway.""They are trying to balance the low oil prices they have always liked, with having an oil price that is high enough to prevent their domestic industry from dying.""That balancing act could very tricky for fracking.It is highly likely that after the pandemic, governments will be asking themselves if atomic energy makes sense, given the challenges the world is facing. Supporters say that, during the crisis, nuclear plants provided around 40-45% of the low carbon electricity used in Europe. Because of the existing focus on safety in the industry, they have coped well with Covid-19, say sources. And they are well placed to cope with an ongoing health crisis.""Safety is already embedded into the culture, so embracing some of the additional safety required to deal with Covid-19 has been something I think that was very easily taken on by the nuclear industry,"" said Jonathan Cobb, from the World Nuclear Association.""And there hasn't been a situation where, because of infections or people self-isolating on a precautionary basis, there's had to be a close down of a nuclear power station.""What makes the industry bullish about the future is that governments will want to invest in large infrastructure projects to provide employment, while at the same time greening their energy systems.While much of the investment in nuclear has taken place in China and Russia in recent years, the time could now be right for more reactors in Europe and the US.""We have got the first power stations under construction in the UK, we've got construction in Finland, in France, but also in Eastern Europe, there's been continuing new build,"" said Jonathan Cobb.""So we've got a high level of new build already with more than 50 reactors being built around the world. And, yeah, the hope is that this will now accelerate and increase.""While there are worries about accidents and nuclear waste, some electricity experts believe nuclear energy is not flexible enough for modern grids, made up of lots of different energy sources. ""The flexibility of nuclear has always been a problem in this,"" said Dave Jones, an electricity analyst at Ember.""It runs 24/7 with very little ability to be able to reduce load around the outside of that, which is what the National Grid would actually need.""Coming out of the crisis, there is a great deal of hope - and indeed quite a deal of hype - around hydrogen as an energy source.Hydrogen can be made from natural gas, but as that's a fossil fuel, it needs to have its carbon captured in some way to make it  sustainable.However a ""greener"" version can be produced from water, by using renewable energy to power a process of electrolysis.As well as not producing any CO2, the resulting gas doesn't contribute to air pollution when it's burned.Advocates believe it could be the answer to one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, heavy transport such as lorries and buses.""As good as batteries are in lighter, smaller vehicles, they are less applicable in larger vehicles, generally because of the weight,"" said Eamonn Ives, from the Centre for Policy Studies, who has published a report on how hydrogen could be key to decarbonising transport.""At the scale of something like a bus or a truck, you could be talking at least a couple to a few tonnes in weight, purely in the batteries themselves.""""When you get to have that sort of size, hydrogen does appear to be quite an elegant solution to decarbonise lots of vehicles.""Hydrogen's strength is its versatility - as well as powering lorries and buses, it can be used in the mix for gas to heat our homes.And in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, the EU and Germany are both keen on increasing investments in this future fuel.The gas does come with some big challenges - making it with green energy is not hugely efficient as yet. It also needs to be kept under pressure to use in vehicles, which right now are very expensive.For energy campaigners, hydrogen has great potential, as long as it is made from renewables, and doesn't become a smokescreen for the continued use of fossil fuels. ""The fact that there's currently so much focus on hydrogen gives us hope that the hard-to-decarbonise sectors like aviation and shipping will finally find a solution to their decarbonisation dilemma. So in that sense, we are positively welcoming this hydrogen discussion,"" said Laura Buffet from Transport & Environment, a Brussels based campaign group.""We don't want to see a situation where we ended up supporting fossil-based technologies and that really would be counter-productive.  We need to be careful and make sure that we have the right safety safeguards in place to ensure that the hydrogen roadmap focuses on renewables-based hydrogen.""Perhaps one of the strongest positives for hydrogen is that it attracts support from across the political spectrum, unlike wind or solar. ""I think it appeals to the conservative side of the political divide because in many ways hydrogen is kind of like diesel or petrol but without the bad stuff,"" said Eamonn Ives.""And so you can quite easily transition, say, the transport fleet over to hydrogen without making an awful lot of change to behavioural patterns.""My colleague Justin Rowlatt has taken a look at the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on coal in a separate article. Like coal, the future for other fossil fuels is now uncertain and depends to a large extent on how governments spend their stimulus packages. One of the most critical questions is over oil.Over the last 10 years, the rise of the diesel- and petrol-powered SUVs around the world has really helped CO2 emissions ramp up.In fact, SUVs were the second-largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions since 2010 - after the power sector.Thanks to the drop in car travel and aviation, fuel oil demand has now fallen away dramatically. Initially, there were concerns that the world would run out of storage, as producers were determined to keep pumping. But Opec (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) agreed to reduce output just in time.""If Opec had not cut, we would be in huge trouble,"" said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, with Rystad Energy. ""But because they did cut production, the Armageddon situation - where the world storage space was not enough to handle the volume - didn't happen.""Now, experts are expecting a rise in demand, as countries emerge from the Covid-19 crisis, and if Opec maintains the same level of production cuts, prices will start to rise. Longer term, analysts believe there will be a strong rebound in oil prices, as many oil drilling projects that were due to start this year and next have been put on ice. ""It basically means that we will have less supply than we will otherwise need,"" said Paolo Rodriguez-Masiu. ""So for the last part of 2021, and the beginning of 2022, our prices [will be] quite bullish."" But even if prices rise, some experts say the writing is on the wall.""We have seen the oil majors reiterate their commitment to clean energy and spare renewables from any cost cuts,"" said Dr Valentina Kretzschmar, from global energy research consultancy, Wood Mackenzie. ""Recovery in oil and gas prices is unlikely to slow down the transition. However, what is likely to slow it down is increasing demand for oil and gas products, as economies start to come back to life.""""It is now more important than ever for governments to act and commit to rebuilding economies on green principles. The EU is leading the way with its Green Deal. We also need to see stimulus packages being tied to companies' commitments to carbon reductions, following the example of Canada.""""Equally, financial regulators need to step up pressures with mandatory reporting on climate-related issues.""Follow Matt on Twitter.",9 June 2020,science
Homes to be heated by warm water from flooded mines,"Burning coal has contributed to the over-heating of our planet. But can abandoned British coal mines help tackle the climate crisis?A new garden village in County Durham will soon be getting its heat from a surprising source: it will be warmed by water from a disused mine. The temperatures are raised naturally, by heat from the Earth's crust. The water is then pumped up from flooded shafts and used to heat the whole district using a single system. The 1,500 residents of South Seaham Garden Village shouldn’t notice that the warmth from the radiators derives from the dust-smeared sweat of their forebears.Surveying work for the scheme is due to happen soon. If the project succeeds, it’ll help meet the UK target of virtually zero carbon emissions by 2050. The potential is large because around a quarter of Britain’s homes sit on coalfields. Although some mines won’t be suitable, it’s hoped that many will supply consistent warm water. For the Coal Authority, which manages disused pits, the idea could turn a liability into a profit.Selling warm water might cover the costs of pumping mines, which has to be done anyway to prevent them burping dirty mine water up to the surface. It would be good news for the environment too, because heat for homes, business and industry is the single biggest contributor to UK emissions – producing almost 40% of Britain's CO2.The energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, told BBC News: “I think it’s potentially transformational. We have this huge historic legacy in terms of coal, and being able to use that footprint and turn it into a source of green energy –  that’s incredibly positive.” Jeremy Crooks from the Coal Authority, which is responsible for closed mines, told us: “The mines are an asset that’s been seen as a liability. Now, with people being much more aware of the damage to climate, other opportunities are being seen.”He said in the right circumstances the costs could compare with gas – which warms 95% of UK homes that have central heating.Minewater heating is low-carbon, but not carbon-free because the water has to be further warmed using a heat pump, which operates like a fridge in reverse. The Coal Authority said electricity to run the pumps would be sourced from renewables where possible.There are other caveats too, according to Dave Banks, a hydrogeologist at Holymoor Consultancy. These include:Mr Banks said one small trial heating scheme in Scotland had closed after it became too costly to maintain.He said maintenance could be better handled by a large project such as one underway in Gateshead town centre.It will heat council buildings, a new care home, and up to 1,250 new homes.Plans are also underway at Rugeley in Staffordshire, where a former coal-fired power station will be turned into a village of 2,300 homes heated partly by water from disused shafts. Currently 14 minewater heat schemes are planned for the north, with seven in the rest of England. Five are planned for Scotland and four for Wales - with a scheme at Caerau, Bridgend the furthest progressed.The technology could prove important in countries such as Poland, which suffer cold winters but have plentiful coal mines. The developments come as campaigners in the UK complain that the government is poised to end grants for commercial users of heat pumps extracting warmth for buildings from sewage farms and industrial plants.

Demands grow for 'green industrial revolution',"Greenpeace has joined a growing list of organisations demanding that the UK government puts protecting the environment at the heart of any post-Covid-19 economic stimulus package.The campaign group has produced a detailed ""manifesto"" with measures to boost clean transport and smart power.The document follows a comparable call from some of Britain's most powerful business leaders earlier this week. Last week, the prime minister also expressed a similar ambition.Boris Johnson said he wanted to see a ""fairer, greener and more resilient global economy"" after Covid-19 and that ""we owe it to future generations to build back better"". The manifesto also contains measures to support the protection of nature, green buildings and the creation of an economy in which virtually everything is reused.Greenpeace says the crisis has given Britain a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to transform life, travel and work.It added that the plan would create hundreds of thousands of secure jobs.On Monday, more than 200 chief executives of some of the UK's top firms - including HSBC, National Grid, and Heathrow airport - signed a letter to the prime minister asking him to use the Covid-19 lockdown as a springboard to ""deliver a clean, just recovery"".Many people may be surprised how similar the recommendations of these two very different interest groups are. Greenpeace's manifesto is, however, considerably more detailed.It is a 62-page document with specific policy, spending and tax measures covering most of the British economy.It calls on the government to deliver its 2050 net zero emissions goal before 2045.Many voters say they support tackling climate change when polled.However, lots of the policies Greenpeace proposes would prove very controversial. For example, motorists say they are ready to change their behaviour to improve air quality, according to a recent AA survey.  But many drivers may balk at Greenpeace's proposals to radically redesign the road network to favour walking and cycling, at the suggestion that petrol and diesel cars are banned by 2030 or that fuel duty is steadily increased.Many homeowners might be reluctant to spend money to upgrade their properties to meet tough energy efficiency standards.At the same time, many local communities are likely to resist the plan for a big increase in onshore wind and solar power to complement a proposed massive expansion of offshore wind farms - few things unite local communities like a proposal to put in an array of wind turbines.But, says Greenpeace, tough policies like these are essential if the government is going to take meaningful action to tackle climate change.""The choices our government makes now will define… whether or not we succeed in the fight against the climate emergency"", says John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace.""If we fail to get this right, we may never get another chance. Now is the time for a green recovery, and for that we need action not words.""It says there would be huge dividends in terms of job creation, should its programme be adopted.Greenpeace calculates that its plans would create hundreds of thousands of new high-skilled jobs as well as helping to level up inequalities between communities in the UK.The UK government has already indicated that protecting the environment will feature heavily in any stimulus package.Back in April, Boris Johnson said a post-Covid-19 recovery plans should include efforts to ""turn the tide on climate change"".Meanwhile, the European Union has unveiled what it called the biggest ""green"" stimulus in history.Last week, it said it planned to commit a whopping €750bn (£667bn; $841bn) to its recovery package.Add in spending from future budgets and the total financial firepower the European Commission says it will be wielding is almost €2tn (£1.8tn; $2.2tn).Fighting climate change is at the heart of the bloc's recovery from the pandemic. There will be tens of billions of euros to make homes more energy efficient, to de-carbonise electricity and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.The idea is to turbo-charge the European effort to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.""If we do not do it, we will be taking much more risk,"" Teresa Ribera, deputy prime minister of Spain, told the BBC.""The recovery should be green or it will not be a recovery, it will just be a shortcut into the kind of problems we are facing right now.""Follow Justin on Twitter.",4 June 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: What is the Crew Dragon?,"The Crew Dragon  launched astronauts from US soil for the first time since the last Shuttle flight in 2011. But it's a very different type of vehicle to Nasa's retired spaceplane.Elon Musk says human spaceflight had always been the fundamental goal for his pioneering company SpaceX.The entrepreneur achieved that ambition on Saturday 30 May 2020, when the Crew Dragon spacecraft carried Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS).But the company had to walk before it could run. Crew Dragon evolved from an earlier design, called Dragon 1, which launched 20 times on missions to deliver cargo to the ISS between May 2012 and March 2020.In May 2014, Musk unveiled the seven-seat Crew Dragon concept during an event at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Like Dragon 1, the crewed version is a capsule design, making it more similar to the Apollo command modules that carried astronauts to the Moon than the winged space shuttle concept, which was conceived to carry both a crew and a large payload.From launch up until shortly before re-entry, the capsule is attached to a section called the trunk which has solar panels, heat-removal radiators and fins to provide stability during emergency aborts. Together, the capsule and trunk stand around 8.1m (26.7ft) tall, with a diameter of 4m (13ft).The Crew Dragon is equipped with 16 Draco thrusters that are used to manoeuvre the vehicle in orbit. Each Draco is capable of producing 90 pounds of force in the vacuum of space.SpaceX engineer John Federspiel, explains: ""When we wanted to take Dragon and make it human-rated, I think we took a different approach to spaceship design than has previously been done, because we wanted this to feel like a 21st Century spaceship.""Probably one of the biggest features of Dragon are the touchscreens on the inside. We designed them not just to be very functional, but with a user experience in mind.""The three large displays that allow Hurley and Behnken to monitor systems and control the spacecraft are a world away from the analogue buttons, dials and control stick that featured in the cockpit of the shuttle, which flew from 1981 to 2011.The two Nasa astronauts have been working with SpaceX to get the vehicle ready for its first crewed flight. Hurley admits that the ""glass cockpit"" took a bit of getting used to. ""As far as actual physical feedback, you certainly don't get that from the touchscreen,"" he says.""But what you do get is an indication of where you touched and that's part of the process of flying the vehicle manually is... I touched that button and that made the vehicle go up and I got the return flash that that's what the vehicle recognised as my input.""For the types of scenarios where astronauts might need to assume manual control of the normally autonomous craft, such as finishing off a docking sequence with the space station, the touchscreen controls are ""much more than adequate"", Hurley adds.""It just might not be the same thing you'd want to use if you were suited up and trying to fly an entry or descent, for example, like we could do with the space shuttle,"" says Behnken.But tailoring the spacecraft to the user experience involved more than just the design of the controls. ""When I think of comfort for the astronauts, it's really every aspect of how you could interact with the spaceship that comes to mind,"" says John Federspiel.""We have three different seat sizes, we even go so far as moulding the foam around the astronaut's body so there's not any pressure points and it's just generally a pleasurable journey into space.""When the astronaut gets ready to strap in, they plug an ""umbilical"" line from their seat into a port on the right thigh of their space suit. The umbilical provides the suit with life support systems, including air and power connections.""The suit is really one part of the bigger Dragon system... we think of it as a suit-seat system,"" says Chris Trigg, space suits and crew equipment manager at SpaceX.But in case anything goes wrong on the pad or during the climb to orbit, SpaceX has designed an innovative abort system for the capsule. The launch escape system (LES) consists of a set of SpaceX-designed SuperDraco engines that fire in the event of an emergency to propel the capsule and its crew safely away from the rocket.Commenting on the LES, Doug Hurley says: ""That perspective for me is huge compared to shuttle, where there were what we call 'black zones'... scenarios where it didn't really matter if you had the right combination of failures, you were likely not going to survive.""Hurley adds that the capsule design is safer than a winged vehicle under most circumstances.Crew Dragon is also designed to be ""two-fault tolerant"". This means that any two things can fail, such as a flight computer and a thruster, and the spacecraft can still bring the crew home safely.The vehicle is designed to dock with the space station autonomously - that is, without having to be guided in by a human. Jessica Jensen, director of Starship mission hardware and operation at SpaceX, says: ""We have GPS sensors on Dragon, but also cameras and imaging sensors such as Lidar on the nosecone as it's approaching the space station.""All these sensors are feeding data back to our flight computer to say: 'Hey, how far away am I from the space station? What's my relative velocity to the space station?'""The flight computer then uses algorithms that determine - based on this information - how to fire the thrusters to most effectively get to the docking target.When it returns to Earth, the Crew Dragon can't simply land on a runway like the space shuttle. ""I think there's an argument that the return is more dangerous in some ways than the ascent,"" says Elon Musk.During re-entry, the heat shield must survive temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sun, as the Crew Dragon screams through the atmosphere at up to 25 times the speed of sound.There's a minor chance that the spacecraft's asymmetric design - driven by the placement of its emergency escape system - could cause it to roll too much. Musk has said in the past that the issue, known as roll instability, has been extensively studied, but that it still worries him.Then, after the fiery re-entry phase, the spacecraft needs to deploy four parachutes to slow its descent. Finally, the Crew Dragon splashes down in the Atlantic Ocean, 450km off the coast of Florida, where recovery ships will take the astronauts to safety and retrieve the capsule. Hurley says that while he and Behnken - along with others at Nasa - provided input, ""this spacecraft - Crew Dragon - is SpaceX's design, from start to finish. Make no mistake about that"".He adds: ""Just to see the vehicle come from not very much, a preliminary design, to where it is today, the operability of the vehicle, the clean lines, how it is inside the vehicle, how it is for a crew... we're just excited to put it through its paces.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",31 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Evolution of the spacesuit,"The spacesuits worn by astronauts for the Crew Dragon mission have been getting a lot of attention. How do they differ from other astronaut attire down the years?The futuristic flight suits worn by Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken during Saturday's successful launch look a world away from the bulky orange shuttle flight suits worn when astronauts last launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.The helmets are 3D-printed and the gloves are touchscreen-sensitive.But their primary purpose remains the same - to protect crew members from depressurisation, where air is lost from the capsule. The suits also ensure astronauts have sufficient oxygen and regulate their temperature. A communications link and breathable air are provided via a single ""umbilical"" cable in the seat that plugs in to the suit.The Starman suits, as they've been called, are all in one piece and customised for the astronaut. Their look was conceived by Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez, who has worked on Captain America: Civil War and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.But they are just designed for use inside the SpaceX capsule, known as the Crew Dragon, and are not suitable for use on spacewalks.Aerospace giant Boeing also has a contract with Nasa to carry astronauts to the space station in its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. It has developed a pressure suit to protect astronauts during the key phases of launch and re-entry.The Boeing Blue suits are about 40% lighter than earlier generations of spacesuits worn by American astronauts - and more flexible.They contain different internal layers to keep astronauts cool. The suit also has touchscreen-sensitive gloves - so astronauts can work with tablets in the spacecraft. The soft, hood-like helmet features a wide polycarbonate visor to give Starliner passengers better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space.Zips in the torso area will make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing.In October 2019, Nasa shared a close-up look at two next-generation suits for the agency's Artemis programme. Under this effort, Nasa will seek to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024, using the agency's Orion spacecraft.One of the suits is called the Orion Crew Survival System, and is comparable to the suits used by SpaceX and Boeing. It recalls the so-called Pumpkin suits used by space shuttle astronauts, but is more lightweight.The other suit, called the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) suit is designed to be worn on the surface of the Moon. It is much bulkier than the pressure suits designed to be worn inside spacecraft.This is because it needs to protect the wearer from temperature extremes outside the walls of the spacecraft. It is also designed to provide some shielding against micrometeorites and other small particles of space debris. In these respects, it is similar to suits previously used for spacewalking at the International Space Station (ISS).There are two suits used for spacewalking at the ISS. One is the Russian Orlan type, which was first used in December 1977.The Orlan is a one-piece spacesuit. The ""backpack"" opens like a fridge door, allowing the spacewalker to climb inside.Nasa's Extravehicular Mobility Suit (EMU) was introduced in 1981 and is the other suit used at the space station.Unlike the Orlan, the EMU comes in separate pieces, with a bottom and top half. The semi-rigid suit provides around 8.5 hours of life support for its wearer outside in the vacuum of space. Astronauts travelling to the ISS train with both suits.The suit worn by Apollo astronauts on the Moon was also called the EMU - though it's different from the modern design. It was the result of years of development.Spacesuits have come a long way since the first spacewalk by the late cosmonaut Alexei Leonov in March 1965.Leonov's suit inflated after he stepped out into the vacuum, so that his hands came out of his gloves. Only by bleeding air out of the suit, which put the cosmonaut at risk of the bends, was he able to get back inside the spacecraft..",28 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Who are the astronauts?,"Two US astronauts have achieved a world first by launching to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a spacecraft built by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Here, BBC News profiles the crew members.Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have broken a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011. In the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz.But officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program.Musk's vehicle was first to fly; Hurley and Behnken travelled to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft.""It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it,"" Hurley, 53, said at the beginning of May, before the flight.Behnken, 49, added: ""On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him.""Nasa chose two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends.""Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that,"" says Hurley.When they launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses knew exactly what they were going through. That's because they're astronauts too.Marine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel.Nyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas.""Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was,"" Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013.Air Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. As an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six.Hurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport.They ""can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be,"" Behnken told CNN before the launch. ""We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands.""Hurley says of Behnken: ""I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face."" But Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two.The older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. ""It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college,"" Hurley said in 2009.Behnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010, he described it as ""a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood"", adding: ""I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person.""He took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him. Both men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines.They both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven.""When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker',"" said Hurley. ""But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table.""Hurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms.Thus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay.When the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as the prime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard.""Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point,"" Hurley said this month.They've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels.Hurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX.""That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them,"" he explained.Setbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016. ""We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made,"" explained Hurley.Despite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remained undimmed: ""It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship.""Hurley told CNN: ""From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree.""But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",31 May 2020,science
Fossil tracks left by an ancient crocodile that 'ran like an ostrich',"Scientists have been stunned to find that some ancient crocodiles might have moved around on two feet.The evidence comes from beautifully preserved fossil tracks in South Korea.Nearly a hundred of these 18-24cm-long indentations were left in what were likely the muddy sediments that surrounded a lake in the Early Cretaceous, 110-120 million years ago.The international team behind the discovery says it will probably challenge our perception of crocodiles. ""People tend to think of crocodiles as animals that don't do very much; that they just laze around all day on the banks of the Nile or next to rivers in Costa Rica. Nobody automatically thinks I wonder what this [creature] would be like if it was bipedal and could run like an ostrich or a T. rex,"" Martin Lockley, an emeritus professor at the University of Colorado, US, told BBC News.The study is sure to provoke a lively debate. Not all researchers will necessarily accept the team's interpretation. Prof Lockley and colleagues have assigned the name Batrachopus grandis to the animal that made the tracks, although no physical remains of it have yet been uncovered.The acknowledgement of the creature's existence rests solely on the fossil prints themselves. These look very similar in shape, albeit much larger, to those made by Batrachopus crocs that lived tens of millions of years earlier in the Jurassic. Except those older beasts very evidently were quadrupeds - they did walk on all fours. A bipedal interpretation for the new Korean trace fossils is the only explanation, claims Prof Lockley.""We can see all the digits, all the ridges in the skin - just as if you were looking at your hands,"" he explained. ""They put one foot in front of another; they could pass a sobriety test walking on a straight line. And there are no front footprints.""The depth of the impressions made by the heel also supports the idea of a more upright posture, said team-leader Prof Kyung Soo Kim from South Korea's Chinju National University of Education.""Our trackways are very narrow-looking - more like a crocodile balancing on a tight-rope,"" he remarked.""When combined with the lack of any tail-drag marks, it became clear that these creatures were moving bipedally.""They were moving in the same way as many dinosaurs, but the footprints were not made by dinosaurs. Dinosaurs and their bird descendants walk on their toes.""Crocodiles walk on the flat of their feet leaving clear heel impressions, like humans do.""For Prof Lockley, the new prints also help re-interpret a South Korean trackway he and other colleagues described eight years ago. In 2012, this group thought a set of less-well defined and slightly younger indentations might have been left by giant versions of the flying reptiles known as pterosaurs. These animals are broadly recognised to have shuffled forwards when on the ground using their feet and hands - rather like a bat. This enigmatic trackway, however, had looked bipedal - perhaps the consequence of a pterosaur wading through water with just its feet in contact with the sediment.Prof Lockley now believes this trackway was also very probably a bipedal Batrachopus.Prof Phil Manning from the University of Manchester, UK, was not part of the discovery team. As a fossil trackway specialist himself, he described the prints as ""very interesting"" and welcomed their publication to begin a discussion - but he doubted the interpretation.""For me, the tracks just don't fit the overall geometry a crocodilian and what it's capable of producing,"" he told BBC News.""Look at any videos of living crocs and the rotation of their feet when they're galloping: it's outwards, not inwards towards the midline of the trackway. Just from their orientation, it looks more like some kind of dinosaurian track-maker to me. But whether it's a croc - unfortunately, we just don't have the fossil bones to tell us.""The tracks of Batrachopus grandis are reported in the journal Scientific Reports.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",11 June 2020,science
Britain goes coal free as renewables edge out fossil fuels,"Britain is about to pass a significant landmark - at midnight on Wednesday it will have gone two full months without burning coal to generate power.A decade ago about 40% of the country's electricity came from coal; coronavirus is part of the story, but far from all. When Britain went into lockdown, electricity demand plummeted; the National Grid responded by taking power plants off the network.The four remaining coal-fired plants were among the first to be shut down.The last coal generator came off the system at midnight on 9 April. No coal has been burnt for electricity since. The current coal-free period smashes the previous record of 18 days, 6 hours and 10 minutes which was set in June last year.The figures apply to Britain only, as Northern Ireland is not on the National Grid.But it reveals just how dramatic the transformation of our energy system has been in the last decade.That the country does not need to use the fuel that used to be the backbone of the grid is thanks to a massive investment in renewable energy over the last decade.Two examples illustrate just how much the UK's energy networks have changed.A decade ago just 3% of the country's electricity came from wind and solar, which many people saw as a costly distraction.Now the UK has the biggest offshore wind industry in the world, as well as the largest single wind farm, completed off the coast of Yorkshire last year.At the same time Drax, the country's biggest power plant, has been taking a different path to renewable energy.The plant, which is also in Yorkshire, generates 5% of the country's electricity.A decade ago, it was the biggest consumer of coal in the UK but has been switching to compressed wood pellets. Drax plans to phase out coal entirely by March next year.""We here at Drax decided that coal was no longer the future,"" explains Will Gardiner, the chief executive of the power group.""It has been a massive undertaking and then the result of all that is we've reduced our CO2 emissions from more than 20 million tonnes a year to almost zero.""That is a controversial claim. Environmental activists point out that wood actually produces more carbon dioxide per unit of power generated than coal when it is burnt to generate electricity. They also say it will take many years for the trees in US forests where Drax sources the seven million tonnes of wood pellets it now burns each year to absorb the CO2 the power plant and its wood processing operations produce each year.And it is not just coal that is being eclipsed by renewables.So far this year, renewables have generated more power than all fossil fuels put together.Breaking it down, renewables were responsible for 37% of electricity supplied to the network versus 35% for fossil fuels. Nuclear accounted for about 18% and imports for the remaining 10% or so, according to figures from the online environmental journal, Carbon Brief.""So far this year renewables have generated more electricity than fossil fuels and that's never happened before"", says Dr Simon Evans of Carbon Brief.""With gas also in decline, there's a real chance that renewables will overtake fossil fuels in 2020 as a whole."" Setting the figures for this year context shows just how quickly this turnaround has happened.The first day when renewable power out-generated fossil fuels was in December 2016.Before this year, there had been a total of 154 days when the combined power created from renewable sources exceeded those from fossil fuels.Carbon Brief says that 91 of those days occurred in 2019.The decline in the role of fossil fuels in general and coal in particular looks set to continue.The remaining three coal plants in the UK will be shut down within five years. Then the fuel that sparked the industrial revolution here in Britain almost two centuries ago will be a thing of the past.Follow Justin on Twitter.",10 June 2020,science
