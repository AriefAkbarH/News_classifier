Coronavirus puts spotlight on landmark year for nature,"The pandemic has disrupted conservation work and funding, with potential repercussions for years to come, according to conservation groups.But we can seize the opportunity to push for stronger action to protect the natural world, say Dr Diogo Veríssimo and Dr Nisha Owen from campaign group On The Edge Conservation.The pandemic struck in what was meant to be a landmark year for biodiversity.New goals for protecting the natural world are due to be agreed in October.While lockdown has been linked to a number of positive environmental changes, including wildlife reclaiming urban spaces, we know very little about how large areas of the world that host vast quantities of biodiversity have been faring, said Dr Owen.""There's reports coming in of illegal activities happening on the ground that are not being patrolled for or monitored or counted because of the effects of coronavirus lockdown or reduced staff or reduced funds,"" she said. ""We're not going to know the scale of what that impact may have been on wildlife and biodiversity until we're able to systematically assess that, and that's probably not going to be until we come out of lockdown."" Loss of funding for conservation work is a growing concern, particularly for lesser-known endangered species, such as pangolins, which already receive a ""smaller slice of the cake"".""It is not just the case that organisations in far flung places are feeling difficulties,"" said Dr Veríssimo, who is also a scientist at the University of Oxford. ""It is also right here in the UK where environmental charities are being gravely affected by all the changes that Covid-19 is producing."" The Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of more than 50 environment and wildlife groups in England, recently warned in a report that UK environment charities are facing a dramatic loss of income, which will have an impact on their ability to care for our land, protect wildlife and tackle climate change and nature's decline for years to come.It comes in what was set to be a ""Super Year for Biodiversity"", as coined by the UN, culminating in a global biodiversity conference in October, where new goals for tackling biodiversity over the next decade were due to be drawn up.Though the timetable has changed, this is a key opportunity for world leaders to set strong goals and highlight that biodiversity is integral to human health and well-being, and the planet that we live on, said Dr Owen.Dr Veríssimo added: ""This pandemic had its biological source in a wild animal.

MPs urge UK ban on chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef,"Hormone-fed beef and chlorine-washed chicken should remain banned in England after Brexit, the government has been warned.Ministers say the issue will be dealt with in the upcoming Trade Bill. But opponents of these practices say that could lead to farm standards being bargained away in negotiations.Instead, they want ministers to guarantee food standards in the Agriculture Bill, which returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday.Some Conservative MPs have joined up with the opposition to demand protection for England's farmers from lower standard produce from countries like the US.Farmers there are allowed to feed beef with hormones and wash chickens with chlorine solution in order to maximise productivity. But both of these practices are currently banned in the EU. The US demands that ban should be lifted.A government spokesperson said existing protections would not be compromised in trade negotiations.The issue is part of a great upheaval in UK farm and countryside policy – the biggest since World War II. The UK government wants to shift farm grants to reward activities that enhance the environment.Its opponents are concerned at the lack of clarity over exactly how the transformation will happen, and want the changes to be delayed.Minsters are likely to suffer huge pressure in the Commons on the question of food import standards.They face almost identical amendments to the Bill from some Conservative back-benchers; the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Select Committee; and the Labour and Liberal Democrat front benches. They are all calling for a level playing field on food standards.Jyoti Fernandes, from the Landworkers' Alliance, a union of farmers and other land-based workers, said: ""The Agriculture Bill is a historic moment to make or break our food system. “If we don’t protect our farms from being undercut by cheap imports and make a firm commitment to supporting our farmers through this transition, we can wave goodbye to a humane and ecological domestic food supply for future generations.""Sally-Ann Spence, from the Nature Friendly Farming Network, runs a farm in Wiltshire. She said: “As a farmer doing my best to protect our precious natural environment and heritage, the prospect of low-standard imports fills me with dread. “In the UK, we are striving to deliver healthy food at world-leading standards whilst managing the land for wildlife and public goods.“I urge MPs to safeguard our high environmental and animal welfare standards in trade law.”With its huge majority, the government is not thought to be in danger of losing key votes.But Neil Parish, Conservative chair of the Efra committee, said: “We (Tories) put high welfare standards in our manifesto so people will be expecting us to deliver on that. “The government mustn’t allow any trade deal with the US, or anyone else, to undermine British food standards.”A government spokesperson said: ""The UK is renowned for its high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards.

Nature crisis: Moths have 'secret role' as crucial pollinators,"Long seen as annoying creatures that can leave holes in your clothes, moths have been badly misjudged, say scientists.New research suggests they play a vital role as overnight pollinators of a wide range of flowers and plants. The study says that the moths' transport networks are larger and more complex than those of daytime pollinators like bees.The authors believe there is an urgent need to stem declines in moth numbers. Over the past decade, public anxiety about the role of our pollinators has focused squarely on bees. The fall-off in their numbers, linked to changes in land and widespread use of pesticides, has helped raise environmental awareness of the critical role these creatures play in the food chain. Moths, though, have not evoked similar sympathies. ""There's this big misconception that all moths come and eat my clothes. That's not what happens at all,"" said Dr Richard Walton, from University College London (UCL), the lead author of the new study.""Some of them happen to be visiting flowers and can be an important part of the pollination process.""To find out how vital a part the moths play, Dr Walton and colleagues monitored moth activity around ponds in agricultural areas of Norfolk. They found that 45% of the moths they tested were transporting pollen, which originated from 47 different plant species, including several that were rarely visited by bees, hoverflies and butterflies. The scientists found that while bumblebees and honeybees are critically important, they tended to target the most prolific nectar and pollen sources. Not so with moths.""From what we see from our work, moths tend to be generalists, meaning they're not specifically visiting a narrow group of flowers,"" said Dr Walton.""They're kind of visiting any type of flower that they can access. These tend to be the open cup-shaped flowers like bramble, they can access things from the legume family, the clover family was also very important.""Previous studies on moths have tended to focus on their ability to transport pollen via their proboscis or nose. This new work looked at the pollen collected on the moths' distinctly hairy bodies when they sit on flowers while feeding. The researchers believe their study shows that moths complement the work of daytime pollinators and help keep plant populations diverse and abundant. They serve as a form of back-up for biodiversity, which in turn supports crop yields.The vital role played by the moths has come under increasing threat as they have suffered steep declines in numbers since the 1970s. This is largely due to changes in land use and the increasing use of pesticides. ""This has a knock-on effect for birds that feed on moths, such as the cuckoo. Its decline is kind of tied to moth declines,"" said Dr Walton.""Bats will feed on moths as well, so there's ties to other creatures having declines in their own populations, because their food supply, the moths, are going down as well. You can see this kind of linkage play out.""Helping the moths will require the use of less pesticide and encouraging a wider diversity of plants in the landscape. But perhaps more importantly, the public perception of moths needs to change. ""Something that's out of sight, is often out of mind,"" said Dr Walton.""We just see bees in the daytime and we see them visiting the flower so they've got the better shift when when it comes to work, in terms of being visible.""""But moths are by no means less important. I think it's vital to raise the profile of moths to help the public at large see the important part they play in our ecology.""The study has been published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters.

Climate change: Study pours cold water on oil company net zero claims,"Claims by oil and gas companies that they are curbing their carbon emissions in line with net zero targets are overstated, according to a new review. The independent analysis of six large European corporations acknowledges they have taken big steps on CO2 recently.In April, Shell became the latest to announce ambitious plans to be at net zero for operational emissions by 2050.But the authors say none of the companies are yet aligned with the 1.5C temperature goal.  Scientists argue that the global temperature must not rise by more than 1.5C by the end of the century if  the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.The research has been carried out by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), an investor-led group which investigates how companies are preparing for the move to a low-carbon economy. Going net zero means removing as many emissions as are produced.TPI found that the relationship between the oil and gas industry and climate change has evolved rapidly over the last three years. In Europe, in 2017, no European company had set targets to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it supplied. Today, all six companies assessed by the analysis have targets and plans. Over the last six months, say the authors of the report, climate ambitions among these companies have risen markedly. In February, the new head of BP, Bernard Looney, committed to cutting net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 or sooner. Going further than his predecessor, Mr Looney said BP would cut the emissions intensity of its sold products by 50% by the middle of this century. But according to this new analysis, BP and Austrian company OMV are the only two oil and gas companies of the six assessed who have failed to align with the pledges made under the Paris climate agreement.""Is it sufficient? No, it's not,"" said Adam Matthews, co-chair of TPI.""There are ones that have more comprehensive commitments that put them on a path much closer to two degrees than some of the others.""Shell is classed as the most ambitious of the companies assessed and are the closest to a 2C warming scenario.However, despite Shell's stated commitment to having a net-zero energy business by 2050, TPI says that ""the claim that it will be aligned with a 1.5C climate scenario is not consistent with our analysis.""The authors say that they have not been able to assess Shell's plan to sell only its energy products to companies that are committed to net zero.""We can't yet quantify that,"" said Adam Matthews.""But that potentially is very significant. And does get them to a sort of one and a half degree of warming kind of commitment, which is equivalent to net zero.""According to the authors, a genuine net zero strategy for the average European oil and gas company would require 100% emissions cuts between now and 2050. TPI point out that all of the plans they have assessed are, to some degree, dependent on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and nature-based solutions such as planting trees. ""There are very significant assumptions that need further probing,"" said Adam Matthews.""And we obviously need greater understanding of the role that that these will play in delivering these strategies.""Four of the companies assessed, Shell, Eni, Total and Repsol, are now aligned with the pledges made under the Paris climate agreement.  However, the authors draw a sharp contrast between the actions of these European companies and oil and gas producers in the US.None of the dozens of American fossil fuel corporations have public disclosures on climate change comparable to Europe, which TPI says is a concern. ""We simply don't know what their intentions are on this issue, that poses a greater financial risk to us,"" said Adam Matthews. ""We're continuing to engage, but engagements are finite, there comes a point at which you have to draw very clear conclusions.""Follow Matt on Twitter.",12 May 2020,science
Longer overlap for modern humans and Neanderthals,"Modern humans began to edge out the Neanderthals in Europe earlier than previously thought, a new study shows.Tests on remains from a cave in northern Bulgaria suggest Homo sapiens was there as early as 46,000 years ago.This is up to 2,000 years older than evidence from Italy and the UK.Around this time, Europe was populated by sparse groups of Neanderthals - a distinct type of human that vanished shortly after modern humans appeared on the scene.There's considerable debate about the length of time that modern humans overlapped with Neanderthals in Europe and other parts of Eurasia.This has implications for the nature of contact between the two groups - and perhaps clues to why Neanderthals went extinct.Two new scientific papers (here and here) describe the finds at Bacho Kiro cave.A tooth and four bone fragments were identified as broadly human based on their anatomical features. Helen Fewlass, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and colleagues determined their ages using scientific techniques. Their analysis, in Nature Ecology & Evolution, says the remains yielded ages between 46,000 and 43,000 years ago, assigning them to a stage known as the Initial Upper Palaeolithic.In the other paper, published in Nature journal, Jean-Jacques Hublin, also from the Max Planck Institute, and team members, detail features of the tooth that are found in modern humans but are absent from Neanderthals.Furthermore, they were able to retrieve DNA from these remains, demonstrating that they belonged to Homo sapiens and not their evolutionary cousins.Prof Chris Stringer, research leader for human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not involved with the latest study, said: ""In my view, this is the oldest and strongest published evidence for an IUP (Initial Upper Palaeolithic) presence of H. sapiens in Europe, several millennia before the Neanderthals disappeared.""The bones were found associated with stone tools and artefacts, such as pendants made from cave bear teeth.These resemble examples found at later sites believed to have been occupied by Neanderthals.This could suggest the two groups interacted sufficiently for modern humans to influence Neanderthal behaviour.On this point, Prof Stringer explained: ""That is certainly possible, although evidence suggests that Neanderthals were producing jewellery made from eagle talons and shells long before the IUP.""Dr Matt Pope, from the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, UK, and was not involved in either study, said: ""If Neanderthals are living - as we tend to think from the genetic evidence - in relatively small dispersed groups of extended families, there may not be that need for complex social coding and symbolism.""This for me is the exciting thing - Neanderthals may pick up these kinds of symbolisms as they become enmeshed and entangled in the social networks of contact that Homo sapiens will be carrying with them as they colonise Europe.""The upper date for the Bacho Kiro remains is older than previous evidence of early Homo sapiens settlement from Kents Cavern in Britain (a jawbone dating to between 44,200 and 41,500 years ago) and from the Italian site of Grotta del Cavallo (two teeth dating to 43,000-45,000 years ago and associated with artefacts belonging to the Uluzzian culture). However, both the British and Italian evidence has been dated using material from the soil layers they were found in. The new paper relied on dating the bones and teeth themselves.Prof Stringer said the Kents Cavern and Cavallo evidence was ""not generally accepted because of uncertainties about their dating or morphology"".A scientific paper published in 2014 proposed that Neanderthals disappeared from Europe between 41,000 and 39,000 years ago with a 95% probability. However, other scientists have found evidence that Neanderthals may have survived later in some areas.At the least, the new finds suggest there was around 5,000 years of chronological overlap between Neanderthals and modern humans in Europe.Dr Pope said there was ""no sudden disappearance"" of Neanderthals in Europe.""The new dates, if they're correct, are pushing back the co-existence of Neanderthals and modern humans a couple of thousand years even further than the evidence from Kents Cavern and the Uluzzian dates,"" he explained.""In some places, we're getting direct evidence for interbreeding events, which could be evidence of social networking and cohesion... but in other examples, we can still see evidence of clear Neanderthal morphologies, suggesting populations that aren't - to any degree - hybridising or being absorbed.""Prof Stringer said initial dispersals of modern humans into Europe may have been by small bands which could not sustain their presence in the face of a larger Neanderthal presence. Indeed, DNA evidence suggests some of these early settlers contributed minimally to the gene pools of later populations.There is even earlier evidence of Homo sapiens in Europe. In 2019, researchers published evidence that a skull fragment from Apidima cave in Greece, dated to 210,000 years ago, belonged to Homo sapiens.However, scientists say this very early foray into Europe was not permanent, and the Apidima Homo sapiens population was later replaced by Neanderthals.Follow Paul on Twitter.",11 May 2020,science

That's not what happens at all,"" said Dr Richard Walton, from University College London (UCL), the lead author of the new study.""Some of them happen to be visiting flowers and can be an important part of the pollination process.""To find out how vital a part the moths play, Dr Walton and colleagues monitored moth activity around ponds in agricultural areas of Norfolk. They found that 45% of the moths they tested were transporting pollen, which originated from 47 different plant species, including several that were rarely visited by bees, hoverflies and butterflies. The scientists found that while bumblebees and honeybees are critically important, they tended to target the most prolific nectar and pollen sources. Not so with moths.""From what we see from our work, moths tend to be generalists, meaning they're not specifically visiting a narrow group of flowers,"" said Dr Walton.""They're kind of visiting any type of flower that they can access. These tend to be the open cup-shaped flowers like bramble, they can access things from the legume family, the clover family was also very important.""Previous studies on moths have tended to focus on their ability to transport pollen via their proboscis or nose. This new work looked at the pollen collected on the moths' distinctly hairy bodies when they sit on flowers while feeding. The researchers believe their study shows that moths complement the work of daytime pollinators and help keep plant populations diverse and abundant. They serve as a form of back-up for biodiversity, which in turn supports crop yields.The vital role played by the moths has come under increasing threat as they have suffered steep declines in numbers since the 1970s. This is largely due to changes in land use and the increasing use of pesticides. ""This has a knock-on effect for birds that feed on moths, such as the cuckoo. Its decline is kind of tied to moth declines,"" said Dr Walton.""Bats will feed on moths as well, so there's ties to other creatures having declines in their own populations, because their food supply, the moths, are going down as well.

Climate change: Study pours cold water on oil company net zero claims,"Claims by oil and gas companies that they are curbing their carbon emissions in line with net zero targets are overstated, according to a new review. The independent analysis of six large European corporations acknowledges they have taken big steps on CO2 recently.In April, Shell became the latest to announce ambitious plans to be at net zero for operational emissions by 2050.But the authors say none of the companies are yet aligned with the 1.5C temperature goal.  Scientists argue that the global temperature must not rise by more than 1.5C by the end of the century if  the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.The research has been carried out by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), an investor-led group which investigates how companies are preparing for the move to a low-carbon economy. Going net zero means removing as many emissions as are produced.TPI found that the relationship between the oil and gas industry and climate change has evolved rapidly over the last three years. In Europe, in 2017, no European company had set targets to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it supplied. Today, all six companies assessed by the analysis have targets and plans. Over the last six months, say the authors of the report, climate ambitions among these companies have risen markedly. In February, the new head of BP, Bernard Looney, committed to cutting net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 or sooner. Going further than his predecessor, Mr Looney said BP would cut the emissions intensity of its sold products by 50% by the middle of this century. But according to this new analysis, BP and Austrian company OMV are the only two oil and gas companies of the six assessed who have failed to align with the pledges made under the Paris climate agreement.""Is it sufficient? No, it's not,"" said Adam Matthews, co-chair of TPI.""There are ones that have more comprehensive commitments that put them on a path much closer to two degrees than some of the others.""Shell is classed as the most ambitious of the companies assessed and are the closest to a 2C warming scenario.However, despite Shell's stated commitment to having a net-zero energy business by 2050, TPI says that ""the claim that it will be aligned with a 1.5C climate scenario is not consistent with our analysis.""The authors say that they have not been able to assess Shell's plan to sell only its energy products to companies that are committed to net zero.""We can't yet quantify that,"" said Adam Matthews.""But that potentially is very significant. And does get them to a sort of one and a half degree of warming kind of commitment, which is equivalent to net zero.""According to the authors, a genuine net zero strategy for the average European oil and gas company would require 100% emissions cuts between now and 2050. TPI point out that all of the plans they have assessed are, to some degree, dependent on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and nature-based solutions such as planting trees. ""There are very significant assumptions that need further probing,"" said Adam Matthews.""And we obviously need greater understanding of the role that that these will play in delivering these strategies.""Four of the companies assessed, Shell, Eni, Total and Repsol, are now aligned with the pledges made under the Paris climate agreement.  However, the authors draw a sharp contrast between the actions of these European companies and oil and gas producers in the US.None of the dozens of American fossil fuel corporations have public disclosures on climate change comparable to Europe, which TPI says is a concern.

Longer overlap for modern humans and Neanderthals,"Modern humans began to edge out the Neanderthals in Europe earlier than previously thought, a new study shows.Tests on remains from a cave in northern Bulgaria suggest Homo sapiens was there as early as 46,000 years ago.This is up to 2,000 years older than evidence from Italy and the UK.Around this time, Europe was populated by sparse groups of Neanderthals - a distinct type of human that vanished shortly after modern humans appeared on the scene.There's considerable debate about the length of time that modern humans overlapped with Neanderthals in Europe and other parts of Eurasia.This has implications for the nature of contact between the two groups - and perhaps clues to why Neanderthals went extinct.Two new scientific papers (here and here) describe the finds at Bacho Kiro cave.A tooth and four bone fragments were identified as broadly human based on their anatomical features. Helen Fewlass, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and colleagues determined their ages using scientific techniques. Their analysis, in Nature Ecology & Evolution, says the remains yielded ages between 46,000 and 43,000 years ago, assigning them to a stage known as the Initial Upper Palaeolithic.In the other paper, published in Nature journal, Jean-Jacques Hublin, also from the Max Planck Institute, and team members, detail features of the tooth that are found in modern humans but are absent from Neanderthals.Furthermore, they were able to retrieve DNA from these remains, demonstrating that they belonged to Homo sapiens and not their evolutionary cousins.Prof Chris Stringer, research leader for human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not involved with the latest study, said: ""In my view, this is the oldest and strongest published evidence for an IUP (Initial Upper Palaeolithic) presence of H. sapiens in Europe, several millennia before the Neanderthals disappeared.""The bones were found associated with stone tools and artefacts, such as pendants made from cave bear teeth.These resemble examples found at later sites believed to have been occupied by Neanderthals.This could suggest the two groups interacted sufficiently for modern humans to influence Neanderthal behaviour.On this point, Prof Stringer explained: ""That is certainly possible, although evidence suggests that Neanderthals were producing jewellery made from eagle talons and shells long before the IUP.""Dr Matt Pope, from the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, UK, and was not involved in either study, said: ""If Neanderthals are living - as we tend to think from the genetic evidence - in relatively small dispersed groups of extended families, there may not be that need for complex social coding and symbolism.""This for me is the exciting thing - Neanderthals may pick up these kinds of symbolisms as they become enmeshed and entangled in the social networks of contact that Homo sapiens will be carrying with them as they colonise Europe.""The upper date for the Bacho Kiro remains is older than previous evidence of early Homo sapiens settlement from Kents Cavern in Britain (a jawbone dating to between 44,200 and 41,500 years ago) and from the Italian site of Grotta del Cavallo (two teeth dating to 43,000-45,000 years ago and associated with artefacts belonging to the Uluzzian culture). However, both the British and Italian evidence has been dated using material from the soil layers they were found in. The new paper relied on dating the bones and teeth themselves.Prof Stringer said the Kents Cavern and Cavallo evidence was ""not generally accepted because of uncertainties about their dating or morphology"".A scientific paper published in 2014 proposed that Neanderthals disappeared from Europe between 41,000 and 39,000 years ago with a 95% probability. However, other scientists have found evidence that Neanderthals may have survived later in some areas.At the least, the new finds suggest there was around 5,000 years of chronological overlap between Neanderthals and modern humans in Europe.Dr Pope said there was ""no sudden disappearance"" of Neanderthals in Europe.""The new dates, if they're correct, are pushing back the co-existence of Neanderthals and modern humans a couple of thousand years even further than the evidence from Kents Cavern and the Uluzzian dates,"" he explained.""In some places, we're getting direct evidence for interbreeding events, which could be evidence of social networking and cohesion... but in other examples, we can still see evidence of clear Neanderthal morphologies, suggesting populations that aren't - to any degree - hybridising or being absorbed.""Prof Stringer said initial dispersals of modern humans into Europe may have been by small bands which could not sustain their presence in the face of a larger Neanderthal presence. Indeed, DNA evidence suggests some of these early settlers contributed minimally to the gene pools of later populations.There is even earlier evidence of Homo sapiens in Europe. In 2019, researchers published evidence that a skull fragment from Apidima cave in Greece, dated to 210,000 years ago, belonged to Homo sapiens.However, scientists say this very early foray into Europe was not permanent, and the Apidima Homo sapiens population was later replaced by Neanderthals.Follow Paul on Twitter.",11 May 2020,science
Coronavirus puts spotlight on landmark year for nature,"The pandemic has disrupted conservation work and funding, with potential repercussions for years to come, according to conservation groups.But we can seize the opportunity to push for stronger action to protect the natural world, say Dr Diogo Veríssimo and Dr Nisha Owen from campaign group On The Edge Conservation.The pandemic struck in what was meant to be a landmark year for biodiversity.New goals for protecting the natural world are due to be agreed in October.While lockdown has been linked to a number of positive environmental changes, including wildlife reclaiming urban spaces, we know very little about how large areas of the world that host vast quantities of biodiversity have been faring, said Dr Owen.""There's reports coming in of illegal activities happening on the ground that are not being patrolled for or monitored or counted because of the effects of coronavirus lockdown or reduced staff or reduced funds,"" she said. ""We're not going to know the scale of what that impact may have been on wildlife and biodiversity until we're able to systematically assess that, and that's probably not going to be until we come out of lockdown."" Loss of funding for conservation work is a growing concern, particularly for lesser-known endangered species, such as pangolins, which already receive a ""smaller slice of the cake"".""It is not just the case that organisations in far flung places are feeling difficulties,"" said Dr Veríssimo, who is also a scientist at the University of Oxford. ""It is also right here in the UK where environmental charities are being gravely affected by all the changes that Covid-19 is producing."" The Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of more than 50 environment and wildlife groups in England, recently warned in a report that UK environment charities are facing a dramatic loss of income, which will have an impact on their ability to care for our land, protect wildlife and tackle climate change and nature's decline for years to come.It comes in what was set to be a ""Super Year for Biodiversity"", as coined by the UN, culminating in a global biodiversity conference in October, where new goals for tackling biodiversity over the next decade were due to be drawn up.Though the timetable has changed, this is a key opportunity for world leaders to set strong goals and highlight that biodiversity is integral to human health and well-being, and the planet that we live on, said Dr Owen.Dr Veríssimo added: ""This pandemic had its biological source in a wild animal. It's about our relationship with nature, and how we have now put animals in contexts and situations where these types of diseases are more likely to not only cross species within wildlife but also cross to humans.""Follow Helen on Twitter.",14 May 2020,science
MPs urge UK ban on chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef,"Hormone-fed beef and chlorine-washed chicken should remain banned in England after Brexit, the government has been warned.Ministers say the issue will be dealt with in the upcoming Trade Bill. But opponents of these practices say that could lead to farm standards being bargained away in negotiations.Instead, they want ministers to guarantee food standards in the Agriculture Bill, which returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday.Some Conservative MPs have joined up with the opposition to demand protection for England's farmers from lower standard produce from countries like the US.Farmers there are allowed to feed beef with hormones and wash chickens with chlorine solution in order to maximise productivity. But both of these practices are currently banned in the EU. The US demands that ban should be lifted.A government spokesperson said existing protections would not be compromised in trade negotiations.The issue is part of a great upheaval in UK farm and countryside policy – the biggest since World War II. The UK government wants to shift farm grants to reward activities that enhance the environment.Its opponents are concerned at the lack of clarity over exactly how the transformation will happen, and want the changes to be delayed.Minsters are likely to suffer huge pressure in the Commons on the question of food import standards.They face almost identical amendments to the Bill from some Conservative back-benchers; the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Select Committee; and the Labour and Liberal Democrat front benches. They are all calling for a level playing field on food standards.Jyoti Fernandes, from the Landworkers' Alliance, a union of farmers and other land-based workers, said: ""The Agriculture Bill is a historic moment to make or break our food system. “If we don’t protect our farms from being undercut by cheap imports and make a firm commitment to supporting our farmers through this transition, we can wave goodbye to a humane and ecological domestic food supply for future generations.""Sally-Ann Spence, from the Nature Friendly Farming Network, runs a farm in Wiltshire. She said: “As a farmer doing my best to protect our precious natural environment and heritage, the prospect of low-standard imports fills me with dread. “In the UK, we are striving to deliver healthy food at world-leading standards whilst managing the land for wildlife and public goods.“I urge MPs to safeguard our high environmental and animal welfare standards in trade law.”With its huge majority, the government is not thought to be in danger of losing key votes.But Neil Parish, Conservative chair of the Efra committee, said: “We (Tories) put high welfare standards in our manifesto so people will be expecting us to deliver on that. “The government mustn’t allow any trade deal with the US, or anyone else, to undermine British food standards.”A government spokesperson said: ""The UK is renowned for its high environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards. ""We have been clear that in all of our trade negotiations we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards.""Agricultural policies in the UK are devolved.Follow Roger on Twitter.",13 May 2020,science
Nature crisis: Moths have 'secret role' as crucial pollinators,"Long seen as annoying creatures that can leave holes in your clothes, moths have been badly misjudged, say scientists.New research suggests they play a vital role as overnight pollinators of a wide range of flowers and plants. The study says that the moths' transport networks are larger and more complex than those of daytime pollinators like bees.The authors believe there is an urgent need to stem declines in moth numbers. Over the past decade, public anxiety about the role of our pollinators has focused squarely on bees. The fall-off in their numbers, linked to changes in land and widespread use of pesticides, has helped raise environmental awareness of the critical role these creatures play in the food chain. Moths, though, have not evoked similar sympathies. ""There's this big misconception that all moths come and eat my clothes.

Climate change: Could the coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery?,"The Covid-19 lockdown has cut climate change emissions - for now. But some governments want to go further by harnessing their economic recovery plans to boost low-carbon industries. Their slogan is ""Build Back Better"", but can they succeed? I've just had a light bulb moment. The feisty little wren chirping loudly in the matted ivy outside my back door is telling us something important about global climate change.That's because, intertwined with the melodious notes of a robin, I can actually hear its song clearly.Normally, both birds are muffled by the insistent rumble of traffic, but the din has been all but extinguished in the peace of lockdown.The drop in traffic is a major contributor to the fall in planet-warming CO2 emissions we've witnessed globally.Before the Covid-19 crisis, we accepted the dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living. Now, we have sampled an alternative urban ambience. Governments currently face a stark choice: bail out polluting businesses, using that as leverage to impose environmentally-minded reforms, or let them return to their carbon-intensive activities as an economic quick fix.But many members of the public have little desire to return to the state of affairs before lockdown.In a poll, a fifth of members of the motoring group the AA, said they would work more from home in future. This has implications for the UK government's £28bn road-building programme which assumes that traffic will rise by 1% per year - a conjecture that now looks unlikely.The stay-at-home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous public transport users shunning trains for fear of infection, and by long-distance commuters who might decide that if they only need to visit the office three days a week, they'll buy a home even further away.The AA, which for years was seen as the voice of motorists, has asked the government to think again about its £28bn road expansion. Its president, Edmund King, has suggested the money would be better spent on improving broadbandAnother likely winner from the crisis is the movement fighting to turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists. This has already happened in places like Paris, which is rolling out 650km of ""corona cycle-ways"", and Milan, which has a programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists.The determination to seize the moment for environmental change stretches further than the transport sector.The UK is one of several nations looking to reboot its environmental strategy by calling in favours from private industry. After all, it was government which bailed out employers when the crunch came in March. The catchphrase is ""Build Back Better"".But it would seem to face a direct challenge in the shape of China and the US. The economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by the effects of coronavirus. They are desperate to get back to pre-virus levels of output, so their leaders may think the surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted climate warming fossil fuels.For those seeking a greener way out of the Covid-19 slump, renewable energy will help, along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband.Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, is on the same track. He is leading work on a Green Deal to make the EU's economy sustainable and says that not a single Euro should be spent propping up old, dirty industries. All Covid-19 recovery investment should go towards commerce that either helps reduce carbon emissions or promotes digital business, he insists.But some MEPs from parties on the right warn that the pandemic will have ""far-reaching"" economic and social consequences.They insist the EU must scale back its pre-crisis climate ambitions. That's led some governments, like Germany and the UK, to offer hand-outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions.In the UK, the issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving the planet.MPs from the Liberal Democrats - thought of as one of the ""greenest"" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for the airline industry. They say that if ministers don't step in, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost.But the firms should promise to off-set their emissions by, for example, planting trees.Off-setting is hugely contentious. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, argues: ""Any government bailout should focus on workers, not the industry itself.""It should be conditional on the industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low-carbon technology is available - which isn't now.""That begs a question: which industries should qualify for support? Should cash go exclusively to self-evidently green sectors like solar power - or to dirty firms trying to clean up?Take the fossil fuel firms that pay our pension dividends by drilling for the stuff that's over-heating the world.The UK's oil and gas industry warns that 30,000 jobs could be lost because of the pandemic and the current low oil price. But why would governments support a commodity that's fuelling the climate crisis, which is judged by the UN to be deeper than the Covid-19 crisis?Perhaps it's not that simple. Lord Stern, the former Treasury chief who's now a climate expert, told me each firm should be judged on its trajectory, not on its current state.""The oil and gas industries are producing stuff you want to run down very quickly,"" he said. ""But you do see some companies - like BP and Shell - which are declaring they are moving in a direction where they want to be going zero carbon. ""So, you can't be indiscriminate or dogmatic. You have to look where the industry is going.""At least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms that agree on the need to tackle climate change. In the US, some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue government bail-outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future.The Democratic Party has a long-standing proposal for a ""Green New Deal"" to promote clean technology. But President Donald Trump has minimised the importance of climate change. He has promised to help struggling fossil fuel firms, although his efforts have not taken root in a major way.He tweeted:  Then there's China. In 2015, its leaders were persuaded by President Barack Obama to make major climate change commitments as part of the Paris climate agreement. Since then, China has suffered job losses and fuel shortages. Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for the economy by building coal-fired power plants.The green think tank Global Energy Monitor says the number of plants China approved in the first three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts (MW) - was more than the number agreed in the whole of 2019 (6,310 MW).That doesn't take into account China's estimated $1 trillion investment in its ""Belt and Road"" initiative to build huge, carbon-intensive infrastructure projects across developing countries.Unless China and President Trump change their spots (or the Democratic candidate wins the US election), Europe's Build Back Better campaign won't be enough to protect the increasingly fragile climate, even if it does engineer a green recovery.And we have a lesson from history. Nick Robins from the London School of Economics (LSE) estimates that in the global financial crisis of 2008 just 16% of global stimulus plans were green - mainly because China invested massively in fossil fuel projects.He tells me: ""If we have any hope of combating climate change, we must make absolutely sure we do it better this time.""Follow Roger on Twitter.What questions do you have about the environment and Covid-19?In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

What is climate change? A really simple guide,"While Covid-19 has shaken much of human society, the threat posed by global warming has not gone away.Human activities have increased carbon dioxide emissions, driving up temperatures. Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. This heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. This is known as climate change or global warming.The greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.Carbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.Most man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. Since the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.Other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.The world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.The 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.Across the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  Most of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.However, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.And satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. Satellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  The effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.The change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.The WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.Temperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer.An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"".The UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.But even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. There is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. It could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.As the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.Poorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. Plant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.As more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.Global warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts. Responding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.What questions do you have about changes in our climate?In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Scientists explain magnetic pole's wanderings,"European scientists think they can now describe with confidence what's driving the drift of the North Magnetic Pole. It's shifted in recent years away from Canada towards Siberia.And this rapid movement has required more frequent updates to navigation systems, including those that operate the mapping functions in smartphones.A team, led from Leeds University, says the behaviour is explained by the competition of two magnetic ""blobs"" on the edge of the Earth's outer core.Changes in the flow of molten material in the planet's interior have altered the strength of the above regions of negative magnetic flux. ""This change in the pattern of flow has weakened the patch under Canada and ever so slightly increased the strength of the patch under Siberia,"" explained Dr Phil Livermore.""This is why the North Pole has left its historic position over the Canadian Arctic and crossed over the International Date Line. Northern Russia is winning the 'tug of war', if you like,"" he told BBC News. Earth has three poles at the top of the planet. A geographic pole which is where the planet's rotation axis intersects the surface. The geomagnetic pole is the location which best fits a classic dipole (its position alters little). And then there is the North Magnetic, or dip, Pole, which is where field lines are perpendicular to the surface.It is this third pole that has been doing all the movement. When first identified by explorer James Clark Ross in the 1830s, it was in Canada's Nunavut territory.Back then it didn't wander very far, very fast. But in the 1990s, it took off, racing to ever higher latitudes and crossing the date line in late 2017. In the process, it came to within just a few hundred kilometres of the geographic pole.Using data from satellites that have measured the evolving shape of Earth's magnetic field over the past 20 years, Dr Livermore and colleagues have attempted to model the North Magnetic Pole's wanderings.Two years ago when they first presented their ideas at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Washington DC, they suggested there might be a connection with a westward-accelerating jet of molten material in the outer core. But the models were a complex fit and the team has now revised its assessment to align with a different flow regime.""The jet is tied to quite high northern latitudes and the alteration in the flow in the outer core that's responsible for the change in the position of the pole is actually further south,"" Dr Livermore said. ""There's also a timing issue. The jet acceleration occurs in the 2000s, whereas the pole acceleration begins in the 1990s.""The team's latest modelling indicates the pole will continue to move towards Russia but will in time begin to slow. At top speed, it's been making 50-60km a year.""Whether or not it will move back again in the future is anyone's guess,"" the Leeds scientist told BBC News.The pole's recent race across the top of the world prompted the US National Geophysical Data Center and the British Geological Survey to issue an early update to the World Magnetic Model last year. This model is a representation of Earth's magnetic field across the entire globe. It is incorporated into all navigation devices, including modern smartphones, to correct for any local compass errors.Dr Livermore and colleagues leaned heavily on the data acquired by the European Space Agency's Swarm satellites. The team has published its research in the journal Nature Geoscience.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",6 May 2020,science
Methane observing firm eyes UK for key base,"The Canadian-based space company GHGSat says it intends to set up a global centre in the UK to analyse the emissions of greenhouse gases.The firm currently flies the spacecraft making the highest resolution measurements of methane (CH4) in the atmosphere.This satellite is the first in a planned network of orbiting observers. The British centre's job will be to take their data and assess the sources of emissions worldwide.For methane - an extremely potent greenhouse gas - these sources could be oil and gas facilities, agriculture, hydro-electric dams, coal mines and landfills.Already, GHGSat is working with operators to identify and plug leaks.It is estimated that 10 million homes could be heated with the methane escaping - largely undetected - from US oil and gas production plants alone. In time, GHGSat wants to fly sensors to monitor carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide as well. The latter is a significant emission from international shipping.Adina Gillespie, a business development director with GHGSat, said the coronavirus pandemic had complicated the company's search for a European HQ, but wouldn't slow it.She hoped to have it set up by the end of the year, she told BBC News.""We're well anchored in North America with offices in Canada and in Houston, Texas. The UK would be our global analytics hub,"" she explained.The company launched its first satellite, called ""Claire"", in 2016. It delivers 12km by 12km spot measurements of methane in the air. Features larger than 50m across can be sensed. This is sufficient to identify point sources.The next generation of spacecraft will have sharper vision still, down to 25m per pixel. The first of these enhanced sensors, ""Iris"", is booked to go up in June, with a third, ""Hugo"", to follow later in 2020.Ten more satellites should fill out the network in 2021 and 2022.GHGSat has been working closely with the European Space Agency (Esa), using the data from its wide-swath Sentinel-5P/Tropomi mission to make the initial identification of methane ""hotspots"" in the atmosphere before then following up with high-resolution observations from the Claire platform to interrogate the sources further.This Esa partnership is about to be extended further in an agency-funded project with the UK's National Physical Laboratory. NPL is Britain's national standards lab and is a world leader in high-fidelity measurement. It has a mobile system operated from a truck that will go to sites to assess the composition of the local air and look for pollutants. It uses differential absorption lidar and other instruments.Esa and NPL see a future for this system as a way to calibrate and validate satellite observations; to provide ""ground truth"" against which the space observations can be compared. ""NPL is looking to provide 'cal-val' services to different satellite operators and for us there is a really attractive opportunity around their trucks,"" Adina Gillespie said.""We've lined up a project with them and Esa. Once the new satellite is launched this summer, we'll use a landfill in the UK to collect some coincident measurements of methane.""Rod Robinson, principal research scientist from NPL, added: ""Satellite measurements of methane will provide an important element in the suite of tools to enable us to monitor progress towards net zero goals. It is important that the data from them is reliable. ""This project is using NPL's unique range of methane measurement capabilities, including Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL), to provide high quality calibrated measurements to characterise an existing source of methane, in this case a landfill,"" he told BBC News.

Surge' in illegal bird of prey killings since lockdown,"The wildlife charity the RSPB says it has been ""overrun"" by reports of birds of prey being illegally killed since the lockdown started six weeks ago.Species of raptors (birds of prey) that had been targeted include hen harriers, peregrine falcons, red kites, goshawks, buzzards and a barn owl.The wildlife charity described the crimes as ""orchestrated"".It said the ""vast majority"" had connections with shooting estates, or land managed for shooting.Some raptors are known to feed on pheasant and grouse chicks.The head of the RSPB's investigations unit, Mark Thomas, told the BBC it was like ""the Wild West"" out in the countryside. He said people who wanted to kill birds of prey had been ""emboldened"" by the absence of walkers and hikers. He said the surge correlated exactly with the date the lockdown was imposed.At this time of year he said that the RSPB would normally be getting three or four reports of the killing of protected bird species each week. They now have three or four reports of a killing each day, and they are coming from across the country. The wildlife charity alleges that the incidents are overwhelmingly connected with land managed for sport shoots. Raptors prey on bird species that have been specifically reared for be killed for sport, like grouse or pheasant.Mr Thomas said, ""I am genuinely disturbed. in more than 20 years of investigating, I've never seen anything like it. We are having to put ongoing investigations on hold in order to triage all these reports... This isn't youngsters with air rifles but orchestrated wildlife crime.""According to the RSPB, on 29 March a buzzard was found shot at Shipton, near York. Its wing was fractured in two places and an X-ray revealed several pieces of shot within the bird's body. The buzzard recovered and was released.Over the Easter Weekend, a red kite was found shot dead near Leeds. It had 12 shotgun pellets lodged in its body.  The following weekend, a dead red kite was found in Powys, which had been shot. There were also reports of another two shot red kites in the area, which is managed for pheasant shooting. In another case in South West England, ten buzzards were found, all thought to have been poisoned.The Investigation Unit suspects that the true number of incidents could be much higher, as there are fewer people out in the countryside who might report cases, with walkers and specialist raptor groups under lockdown. All birds of prey are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981).The Moorland Association (MA), whose members include many shooting estates in England and Wales, said it condemned illegal activity. The MA's Director, Amanda Anderson, said: ""The reports we have from our members in the uplands have suggested that many birds of prey are in fact benefiting from the lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reduction in disturbance from members of the public.

Ozone layer: Concern grows over threat from replacement chemicals,"Substances used for air conditioning in almost all new cars are building up in the environment and may pose a threat to human health, researchers say.These ""ozone friendly"" chemicals have been introduced to replace products that were damaging the ozone layer.Now widely used across industry, these alternatives do not break down in the environment.Scientists have now found increasing levels of these chemicals in Arctic ice samples dating back to the 1990s. The Montreal Protocol is regarded as one of the most successful environmental treaties ever adopted.Signed back in 1987, it committed countries to regulate their use of chlorofluorocarbon chemicals (CFCs) that had recently been found to be depleting the ozone layer. A growing hole in the ozone over Antarctica had been detected in the mid-1980s and there was serious concern about the threat it posed to human health.CFCs were then widely used in refrigeration, in air conditioning, as solvents and in aerosol sprays.In the intervening decades, alternative products that are less harmful to the ozone layer were introduced. As a result, researchers have reported progress in reducing the size of the hole.However, there are now concerns that the solution may be inadvertently damaging the environment and threatening human health.Canadian researchers, studying ice samples from the Arctic dating back to the 1990s, have found ""dramatically"" increasing levels of ozone replacements called short chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (scPFCAs).""We're seeing much, much larger levels, on the order of 10 times higher now than we saw before the Montreal Protocol,"" said Prof Cora Young, from York University in Toronto, the study's corresponding author.""We don't know a lot about them and their potential toxicity, but we do know that we are committing the environment to a great deal of contamination.""The compounds being detected in the Arctic are in the same class as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, sometimes called the ""forever chemicals"".These long-lasting chemicals are found in everything, from furniture to clothing to food wrapping to drinking water. There is growing concern about the role of PFAS in serious health conditions including cancer, liver damage and decreased fertility.The related products, found in the Arctic ice samples, do not break down in the environment and current water filtration technology is unable to remove them.The scientists expect levels of scPFCAS to increase markedly in the future.As part of the efforts to replace CFCs, car manufacturers around the world agreed to use a different coolant in air conditioning called HFC-134a which was introduced in 1992. While HFC-134a was less damaging to the ozone layer, it was unfortunately a very powerful greenhouse gas, around 1,400 times more warming that CO2. So manufacturers in the US and Europe agreed to phase out HFC-134a and by 2017 all new cars had to use a different coolant for air conditioning called HFO-1234yf.While this chemical doesn't damage ozone, and is not a greenhouse gas, it does unfortunately break down to produce short chain PFCAs.""It has a very low global warming potential, but has a much higher propensity to form these persistent products,"" said Prof Young. ""It will be again another shift, where we see an even more dramatic increase.""According to the researchers, these chemicals can travel a long distance in the atmosphere and often end up in lakes and rivers. They cause ""irreversible contamination"" and can impact the health of freshwater creatures including crustaceans and worms. There is growing concern that these compounds may impact human health as well.""They've been found in the bodies of people in China, so it is likely to be found in the bodies of people around the world,"" said Prof Young.""We have done a good job in trying to save the ozone layer but the unintended consequences are the release of these other chemicals, which have some concerns.""""They're toxic, and then they don't get filtered out in various ways.""The study has been published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.Follow Matt on Twitter.",14 May 2020,science

MPs urge UK ban on chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef,"Hormone-fed beef and chlorine-washed chicken should remain banned in England after Brexit, the government has been warned.Ministers say the issue will be dealt with in the upcoming Trade Bill. But opponents of these practices say that could lead to farm standards being bargained away in negotiations.Instead, they want ministers to guarantee food standards in the Agriculture Bill, which returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday.Some Conservative MPs have joined up with the opposition to demand protection for England's farmers from lower standard produce from countries like the US.Farmers there are allowed to feed beef with hormones and wash chickens with chlorine solution in order to maximise productivity. But both of these practices are currently banned in the EU.

Surge' in illegal bird of prey killings since lockdown,"The wildlife charity the RSPB says it has been ""overrun"" by reports of birds of prey being illegally killed since the lockdown started six weeks ago.Species of raptors (birds of prey) that had been targeted include hen harriers, peregrine falcons, red kites, goshawks, buzzards and a barn owl.The wildlife charity described the crimes as ""orchestrated"".It said the ""vast majority"" had connections with shooting estates, or land managed for shooting.Some raptors are known to feed on pheasant and grouse chicks.The head of the RSPB's investigations unit, Mark Thomas, told the BBC it was like ""the Wild West"" out in the countryside. He said people who wanted to kill birds of prey had been ""emboldened"" by the absence of walkers and hikers. He said the surge correlated exactly with the date the lockdown was imposed.At this time of year he said that the RSPB would normally be getting three or four reports of the killing of protected bird species each week. They now have three or four reports of a killing each day, and they are coming from across the country. The wildlife charity alleges that the incidents are overwhelmingly connected with land managed for sport shoots. Raptors prey on bird species that have been specifically reared for be killed for sport, like grouse or pheasant.Mr Thomas said, ""I am genuinely disturbed. in more than 20 years of investigating, I've never seen anything like it. We are having to put ongoing investigations on hold in order to triage all these reports... This isn't youngsters with air rifles but orchestrated wildlife crime.""According to the RSPB, on 29 March a buzzard was found shot at Shipton, near York. Its wing was fractured in two places and an X-ray revealed several pieces of shot within the bird's body. The buzzard recovered and was released.Over the Easter Weekend, a red kite was found shot dead near Leeds. It had 12 shotgun pellets lodged in its body.  The following weekend, a dead red kite was found in Powys, which had been shot. There were also reports of another two shot red kites in the area, which is managed for pheasant shooting. In another case in South West England, ten buzzards were found, all thought to have been poisoned.The Investigation Unit suspects that the true number of incidents could be much higher, as there are fewer people out in the countryside who might report cases, with walkers and specialist raptor groups under lockdown. All birds of prey are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981).The Moorland Association (MA), whose members include many shooting estates in England and Wales, said it condemned illegal activity. The MA's Director, Amanda Anderson, said: ""The reports we have from our members in the uplands have suggested that many birds of prey are in fact benefiting from the lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reduction in disturbance from members of the public. ""Estates across the country have reported a number of raptors including peregrine, merlin and hen harriers nesting and living on those landscapes.""",15 May 2020,science
Ozone layer: Concern grows over threat from replacement chemicals,"Substances used for air conditioning in almost all new cars are building up in the environment and may pose a threat to human health, researchers say.These ""ozone friendly"" chemicals have been introduced to replace products that were damaging the ozone layer.Now widely used across industry, these alternatives do not break down in the environment.Scientists have now found increasing levels of these chemicals in Arctic ice samples dating back to the 1990s. The Montreal Protocol is regarded as one of the most successful environmental treaties ever adopted.Signed back in 1987, it committed countries to regulate their use of chlorofluorocarbon chemicals (CFCs) that had recently been found to be depleting the ozone layer. A growing hole in the ozone over Antarctica had been detected in the mid-1980s and there was serious concern about the threat it posed to human health.CFCs were then widely used in refrigeration, in air conditioning, as solvents and in aerosol sprays.In the intervening decades, alternative products that are less harmful to the ozone layer were introduced. As a result, researchers have reported progress in reducing the size of the hole.However, there are now concerns that the solution may be inadvertently damaging the environment and threatening human health.Canadian researchers, studying ice samples from the Arctic dating back to the 1990s, have found ""dramatically"" increasing levels of ozone replacements called short chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (scPFCAs).""We're seeing much, much larger levels, on the order of 10 times higher now than we saw before the Montreal Protocol,"" said Prof Cora Young, from York University in Toronto, the study's corresponding author.""We don't know a lot about them and their potential toxicity, but we do know that we are committing the environment to a great deal of contamination.""The compounds being detected in the Arctic are in the same class as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, sometimes called the ""forever chemicals"".These long-lasting chemicals are found in everything, from furniture to clothing to food wrapping to drinking water. There is growing concern about the role of PFAS in serious health conditions including cancer, liver damage and decreased fertility.The related products, found in the Arctic ice samples, do not break down in the environment and current water filtration technology is unable to remove them.The scientists expect levels of scPFCAS to increase markedly in the future.As part of the efforts to replace CFCs, car manufacturers around the world agreed to use a different coolant in air conditioning called HFC-134a which was introduced in 1992. While HFC-134a was less damaging to the ozone layer, it was unfortunately a very powerful greenhouse gas, around 1,400 times more warming that CO2. So manufacturers in the US and Europe agreed to phase out HFC-134a and by 2017 all new cars had to use a different coolant for air conditioning called HFO-1234yf.While this chemical doesn't damage ozone, and is not a greenhouse gas, it does unfortunately break down to produce short chain PFCAs.""It has a very low global warming potential, but has a much higher propensity to form these persistent products,"" said Prof Young. ""It will be again another shift, where we see an even more dramatic increase.""According to the researchers, these chemicals can travel a long distance in the atmosphere and often end up in lakes and rivers. They cause ""irreversible contamination"" and can impact the health of freshwater creatures including crustaceans and worms. There is growing concern that these compounds may impact human health as well.""They've been found in the bodies of people in China, so it is likely to be found in the bodies of people around the world,"" said Prof Young.""We have done a good job in trying to save the ozone layer but the unintended consequences are the release of these other chemicals, which have some concerns.""""They're toxic, and then they don't get filtered out in various ways.""The study has been published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.Follow Matt on Twitter.",14 May 2020,science
Methane observing firm eyes UK for key base,"The Canadian-based space company GHGSat says it intends to set up a global centre in the UK to analyse the emissions of greenhouse gases.The firm currently flies the spacecraft making the highest resolution measurements of methane (CH4) in the atmosphere.This satellite is the first in a planned network of orbiting observers. The British centre's job will be to take their data and assess the sources of emissions worldwide.For methane - an extremely potent greenhouse gas - these sources could be oil and gas facilities, agriculture, hydro-electric dams, coal mines and landfills.Already, GHGSat is working with operators to identify and plug leaks.It is estimated that 10 million homes could be heated with the methane escaping - largely undetected - from US oil and gas production plants alone. In time, GHGSat wants to fly sensors to monitor carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide as well. The latter is a significant emission from international shipping.Adina Gillespie, a business development director with GHGSat, said the coronavirus pandemic had complicated the company's search for a European HQ, but wouldn't slow it.She hoped to have it set up by the end of the year, she told BBC News.""We're well anchored in North America with offices in Canada and in Houston, Texas. The UK would be our global analytics hub,"" she explained.The company launched its first satellite, called ""Claire"", in 2016. It delivers 12km by 12km spot measurements of methane in the air. Features larger than 50m across can be sensed. This is sufficient to identify point sources.The next generation of spacecraft will have sharper vision still, down to 25m per pixel. The first of these enhanced sensors, ""Iris"", is booked to go up in June, with a third, ""Hugo"", to follow later in 2020.Ten more satellites should fill out the network in 2021 and 2022.GHGSat has been working closely with the European Space Agency (Esa), using the data from its wide-swath Sentinel-5P/Tropomi mission to make the initial identification of methane ""hotspots"" in the atmosphere before then following up with high-resolution observations from the Claire platform to interrogate the sources further.This Esa partnership is about to be extended further in an agency-funded project with the UK's National Physical Laboratory. NPL is Britain's national standards lab and is a world leader in high-fidelity measurement. It has a mobile system operated from a truck that will go to sites to assess the composition of the local air and look for pollutants. It uses differential absorption lidar and other instruments.Esa and NPL see a future for this system as a way to calibrate and validate satellite observations; to provide ""ground truth"" against which the space observations can be compared. ""NPL is looking to provide 'cal-val' services to different satellite operators and for us there is a really attractive opportunity around their trucks,"" Adina Gillespie said.""We've lined up a project with them and Esa. Once the new satellite is launched this summer, we'll use a landfill in the UK to collect some coincident measurements of methane.""Rod Robinson, principal research scientist from NPL, added: ""Satellite measurements of methane will provide an important element in the suite of tools to enable us to monitor progress towards net zero goals. It is important that the data from them is reliable. ""This project is using NPL's unique range of methane measurement capabilities, including Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL), to provide high quality calibrated measurements to characterise an existing source of methane, in this case a landfill,"" he told BBC News. ""This will provide a known emission source against which satellites can be regularly checked. This is part of a demonstrator project for Esa, which we then intend to roll out to an ongoing calibration service in the future.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",14 May 2020,science
Coronavirus puts spotlight on landmark year for nature,"The pandemic has disrupted conservation work and funding, with potential repercussions for years to come, according to conservation groups.But we can seize the opportunity to push for stronger action to protect the natural world, say Dr Diogo Veríssimo and Dr Nisha Owen from campaign group On The Edge Conservation.The pandemic struck in what was meant to be a landmark year for biodiversity.New goals for protecting the natural world are due to be agreed in October.While lockdown has been linked to a number of positive environmental changes, including wildlife reclaiming urban spaces, we know very little about how large areas of the world that host vast quantities of biodiversity have been faring, said Dr Owen.""There's reports coming in of illegal activities happening on the ground that are not being patrolled for or monitored or counted because of the effects of coronavirus lockdown or reduced staff or reduced funds,"" she said. ""We're not going to know the scale of what that impact may have been on wildlife and biodiversity until we're able to systematically assess that, and that's probably not going to be until we come out of lockdown."" Loss of funding for conservation work is a growing concern, particularly for lesser-known endangered species, such as pangolins, which already receive a ""smaller slice of the cake"".""It is not just the case that organisations in far flung places are feeling difficulties,"" said Dr Veríssimo, who is also a scientist at the University of Oxford. ""It is also right here in the UK where environmental charities are being gravely affected by all the changes that Covid-19 is producing."" The Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of more than 50 environment and wildlife groups in England, recently warned in a report that UK environment charities are facing a dramatic loss of income, which will have an impact on their ability to care for our land, protect wildlife and tackle climate change and nature's decline for years to come.It comes in what was set to be a ""Super Year for Biodiversity"", as coined by the UN, culminating in a global biodiversity conference in October, where new goals for tackling biodiversity over the next decade were due to be drawn up.Though the timetable has changed, this is a key opportunity for world leaders to set strong goals and highlight that biodiversity is integral to human health and well-being, and the planet that we live on, said Dr Owen.Dr Veríssimo added: ""This pandemic had its biological source in a wild animal.

Climate change: Could the coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery?,"The Covid-19 lockdown has cut climate change emissions - for now. But some governments want to go further by harnessing their economic recovery plans to boost low-carbon industries. Their slogan is ""Build Back Better"", but can they succeed? I've just had a light bulb moment. The feisty little wren chirping loudly in the matted ivy outside my back door is telling us something important about global climate change.That's because, intertwined with the melodious notes of a robin, I can actually hear its song clearly.Normally, both birds are muffled by the insistent rumble of traffic, but the din has been all but extinguished in the peace of lockdown.The drop in traffic is a major contributor to the fall in planet-warming CO2 emissions we've witnessed globally.Before the Covid-19 crisis, we accepted the dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living. Now, we have sampled an alternative urban ambience. Governments currently face a stark choice: bail out polluting businesses, using that as leverage to impose environmentally-minded reforms, or let them return to their carbon-intensive activities as an economic quick fix.But many members of the public have little desire to return to the state of affairs before lockdown.In a poll, a fifth of members of the motoring group the AA, said they would work more from home in future. This has implications for the UK government's £28bn road-building programme which assumes that traffic will rise by 1% per year - a conjecture that now looks unlikely.The stay-at-home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous public transport users shunning trains for fear of infection, and by long-distance commuters who might decide that if they only need to visit the office three days a week, they'll buy a home even further away.The AA, which for years was seen as the voice of motorists, has asked the government to think again about its £28bn road expansion. Its president, Edmund King, has suggested the money would be better spent on improving broadbandAnother likely winner from the crisis is the movement fighting to turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists. This has already happened in places like Paris, which is rolling out 650km of ""corona cycle-ways"", and Milan, which has a programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists.The determination to seize the moment for environmental change stretches further than the transport sector.The UK is one of several nations looking to reboot its environmental strategy by calling in favours from private industry. After all, it was government which bailed out employers when the crunch came in March. The catchphrase is ""Build Back Better"".But it would seem to face a direct challenge in the shape of China and the US. The economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by the effects of coronavirus. They are desperate to get back to pre-virus levels of output, so their leaders may think the surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted climate warming fossil fuels.For those seeking a greener way out of the Covid-19 slump, renewable energy will help, along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband.Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, is on the same track. He is leading work on a Green Deal to make the EU's economy sustainable and says that not a single Euro should be spent propping up old, dirty industries. All Covid-19 recovery investment should go towards commerce that either helps reduce carbon emissions or promotes digital business, he insists.But some MEPs from parties on the right warn that the pandemic will have ""far-reaching"" economic and social consequences.They insist the EU must scale back its pre-crisis climate ambitions. That's led some governments, like Germany and the UK, to offer hand-outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions.In the UK, the issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving the planet.MPs from the Liberal Democrats - thought of as one of the ""greenest"" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for the airline industry. They say that if ministers don't step in, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost.But the firms should promise to off-set their emissions by, for example, planting trees.Off-setting is hugely contentious. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, argues: ""Any government bailout should focus on workers, not the industry itself.""It should be conditional on the industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low-carbon technology is available - which isn't now.""That begs a question: which industries should qualify for support? Should cash go exclusively to self-evidently green sectors like solar power - or to dirty firms trying to clean up?Take the fossil fuel firms that pay our pension dividends by drilling for the stuff that's over-heating the world.The UK's oil and gas industry warns that 30,000 jobs could be lost because of the pandemic and the current low oil price. But why would governments support a commodity that's fuelling the climate crisis, which is judged by the UN to be deeper than the Covid-19 crisis?Perhaps it's not that simple. Lord Stern, the former Treasury chief who's now a climate expert, told me each firm should be judged on its trajectory, not on its current state.""The oil and gas industries are producing stuff you want to run down very quickly,"" he said. ""But you do see some companies - like BP and Shell - which are declaring they are moving in a direction where they want to be going zero carbon. ""So, you can't be indiscriminate or dogmatic. You have to look where the industry is going.""At least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms that agree on the need to tackle climate change. In the US, some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue government bail-outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future.The Democratic Party has a long-standing proposal for a ""Green New Deal"" to promote clean technology. But President Donald Trump has minimised the importance of climate change. He has promised to help struggling fossil fuel firms, although his efforts have not taken root in a major way.He tweeted:  Then there's China. In 2015, its leaders were persuaded by President Barack Obama to make major climate change commitments as part of the Paris climate agreement. Since then, China has suffered job losses and fuel shortages. Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for the economy by building coal-fired power plants.The green think tank Global Energy Monitor says the number of plants China approved in the first three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts (MW) - was more than the number agreed in the whole of 2019 (6,310 MW).That doesn't take into account China's estimated $1 trillion investment in its ""Belt and Road"" initiative to build huge, carbon-intensive infrastructure projects across developing countries.Unless China and President Trump change their spots (or the Democratic candidate wins the US election), Europe's Build Back Better campaign won't be enough to protect the increasingly fragile climate, even if it does engineer a green recovery.And we have a lesson from history. Nick Robins from the London School of Economics (LSE) estimates that in the global financial crisis of 2008 just 16% of global stimulus plans were green - mainly because China invested massively in fossil fuel projects.He tells me: ""If we have any hope of combating climate change, we must make absolutely sure we do it better this time.""Follow Roger on Twitter.What questions do you have about the environment and Covid-19?In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

What is climate change? A really simple guide,"While Covid-19 has shaken much of human society, the threat posed by global warming has not gone away.Human activities have increased carbon dioxide emissions, driving up temperatures. Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. This heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. This is known as climate change or global warming.The greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.Carbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.Most man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. Since the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.Other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.The world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.The 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.Across the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  Most of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.However, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.And satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. Satellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  The effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.The change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.The WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.Temperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer.An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"".The UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.But even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. There is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. It could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.As the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.Poorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. Plant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.As more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.Global warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts. Responding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.What questions do you have about changes in our climate?In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Scientists explain magnetic pole's wanderings,"European scientists think they can now describe with confidence what's driving the drift of the North Magnetic Pole. It's shifted in recent years away from Canada towards Siberia.And this rapid movement has required more frequent updates to navigation systems, including those that operate the mapping functions in smartphones.A team, led from Leeds University, says the behaviour is explained by the competition of two magnetic ""blobs"" on the edge of the Earth's outer core.Changes in the flow of molten material in the planet's interior have altered the strength of the above regions of negative magnetic flux. ""This change in the pattern of flow has weakened the patch under Canada and ever so slightly increased the strength of the patch under Siberia,"" explained Dr Phil Livermore.""This is why the North Pole has left its historic position over the Canadian Arctic and crossed over the International Date Line. Northern Russia is winning the 'tug of war', if you like,"" he told BBC News. Earth has three poles at the top of the planet. A geographic pole which is where the planet's rotation axis intersects the surface. The geomagnetic pole is the location which best fits a classic dipole (its position alters little). And then there is the North Magnetic, or dip, Pole, which is where field lines are perpendicular to the surface.It is this third pole that has been doing all the movement. When first identified by explorer James Clark Ross in the 1830s, it was in Canada's Nunavut territory.Back then it didn't wander very far, very fast. But in the 1990s, it took off, racing to ever higher latitudes and crossing the date line in late 2017. In the process, it came to within just a few hundred kilometres of the geographic pole.Using data from satellites that have measured the evolving shape of Earth's magnetic field over the past 20 years, Dr Livermore and colleagues have attempted to model the North Magnetic Pole's wanderings.Two years ago when they first presented their ideas at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Washington DC, they suggested there might be a connection with a westward-accelerating jet of molten material in the outer core. But the models were a complex fit and the team has now revised its assessment to align with a different flow regime.""The jet is tied to quite high northern latitudes and the alteration in the flow in the outer core that's responsible for the change in the position of the pole is actually further south,"" Dr Livermore said. ""There's also a timing issue. The jet acceleration occurs in the 2000s, whereas the pole acceleration begins in the 1990s.""The team's latest modelling indicates the pole will continue to move towards Russia but will in time begin to slow. At top speed, it's been making 50-60km a year.""Whether or not it will move back again in the future is anyone's guess,"" the Leeds scientist told BBC News.The pole's recent race across the top of the world prompted the US National Geophysical Data Center and the British Geological Survey to issue an early update to the World Magnetic Model last year. This model is a representation of Earth's magnetic field across the entire globe. It is incorporated into all navigation devices, including modern smartphones, to correct for any local compass errors.Dr Livermore and colleagues leaned heavily on the data acquired by the European Space Agency's Swarm satellites.

Surge' in illegal bird of prey killings since lockdown,"The wildlife charity the RSPB says it has been ""overrun"" by reports of birds of prey being illegally killed since the lockdown started six weeks ago.Species of raptors (birds of prey) that had been targeted include hen harriers, peregrine falcons, red kites, goshawks, buzzards and a barn owl.The wildlife charity described the crimes as ""orchestrated"".It said the ""vast majority"" had connections with shooting estates, or land managed for shooting.Some raptors are known to feed on pheasant and grouse chicks.The head of the RSPB's investigations unit, Mark Thomas, told the BBC it was like ""the Wild West"" out in the countryside. He said people who wanted to kill birds of prey had been ""emboldened"" by the absence of walkers and hikers. He said the surge correlated exactly with the date the lockdown was imposed.At this time of year he said that the RSPB would normally be getting three or four reports of the killing of protected bird species each week. They now have three or four reports of a killing each day, and they are coming from across the country. The wildlife charity alleges that the incidents are overwhelmingly connected with land managed for sport shoots. Raptors prey on bird species that have been specifically reared for be killed for sport, like grouse or pheasant.Mr Thomas said, ""I am genuinely disturbed. in more than 20 years of investigating, I've never seen anything like it. We are having to put ongoing investigations on hold in order to triage all these reports... This isn't youngsters with air rifles but orchestrated wildlife crime.""According to the RSPB, on 29 March a buzzard was found shot at Shipton, near York. Its wing was fractured in two places and an X-ray revealed several pieces of shot within the bird's body. The buzzard recovered and was released.Over the Easter Weekend, a red kite was found shot dead near Leeds. It had 12 shotgun pellets lodged in its body.  The following weekend, a dead red kite was found in Powys, which had been shot. There were also reports of another two shot red kites in the area, which is managed for pheasant shooting. In another case in South West England, ten buzzards were found, all thought to have been poisoned.The Investigation Unit suspects that the true number of incidents could be much higher, as there are fewer people out in the countryside who might report cases, with walkers and specialist raptor groups under lockdown. All birds of prey are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981).The Moorland Association (MA), whose members include many shooting estates in England and Wales, said it condemned illegal activity. The MA's Director, Amanda Anderson, said: ""The reports we have from our members in the uplands have suggested that many birds of prey are in fact benefiting from the lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reduction in disturbance from members of the public. ""Estates across the country have reported a number of raptors including peregrine, merlin and hen harriers nesting and living on those landscapes.""",15 May 2020,science
Ozone layer: Concern grows over threat from replacement chemicals,"Substances used for air conditioning in almost all new cars are building up in the environment and may pose a threat to human health, researchers say.These ""ozone friendly"" chemicals have been introduced to replace products that were damaging the ozone layer.Now widely used across industry, these alternatives do not break down in the environment.Scientists have now found increasing levels of these chemicals in Arctic ice samples dating back to the 1990s. The Montreal Protocol is regarded as one of the most successful environmental treaties ever adopted.Signed back in 1987, it committed countries to regulate their use of chlorofluorocarbon chemicals (CFCs) that had recently been found to be depleting the ozone layer. A growing hole in the ozone over Antarctica had been detected in the mid-1980s and there was serious concern about the threat it posed to human health.CFCs were then widely used in refrigeration, in air conditioning, as solvents and in aerosol sprays.In the intervening decades, alternative products that are less harmful to the ozone layer were introduced. As a result, researchers have reported progress in reducing the size of the hole.However, there are now concerns that the solution may be inadvertently damaging the environment and threatening human health.Canadian researchers, studying ice samples from the Arctic dating back to the 1990s, have found ""dramatically"" increasing levels of ozone replacements called short chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (scPFCAs).""We're seeing much, much larger levels, on the order of 10 times higher now than we saw before the Montreal Protocol,"" said Prof Cora Young, from York University in Toronto, the study's corresponding author.""We don't know a lot about them and their potential toxicity, but we do know that we are committing the environment to a great deal of contamination.""The compounds being detected in the Arctic are in the same class as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, sometimes called the ""forever chemicals"".These long-lasting chemicals are found in everything, from furniture to clothing to food wrapping to drinking water. There is growing concern about the role of PFAS in serious health conditions including cancer, liver damage and decreased fertility.The related products, found in the Arctic ice samples, do not break down in the environment and current water filtration technology is unable to remove them.The scientists expect levels of scPFCAS to increase markedly in the future.As part of the efforts to replace CFCs, car manufacturers around the world agreed to use a different coolant in air conditioning called HFC-134a which was introduced in 1992. While HFC-134a was less damaging to the ozone layer, it was unfortunately a very powerful greenhouse gas, around 1,400 times more warming that CO2. So manufacturers in the US and Europe agreed to phase out HFC-134a and by 2017 all new cars had to use a different coolant for air conditioning called HFO-1234yf.While this chemical doesn't damage ozone, and is not a greenhouse gas, it does unfortunately break down to produce short chain PFCAs.""It has a very low global warming potential, but has a much higher propensity to form these persistent products,"" said Prof Young. ""It will be again another shift, where we see an even more dramatic increase.""According to the researchers, these chemicals can travel a long distance in the atmosphere and often end up in lakes and rivers. They cause ""irreversible contamination"" and can impact the health of freshwater creatures including crustaceans and worms. There is growing concern that these compounds may impact human health as well.""They've been found in the bodies of people in China, so it is likely to be found in the bodies of people around the world,"" said Prof Young.""We have done a good job in trying to save the ozone layer but the unintended consequences are the release of these other chemicals, which have some concerns.""""They're toxic, and then they don't get filtered out in various ways.""The study has been published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.Follow Matt on Twitter.",14 May 2020,science
