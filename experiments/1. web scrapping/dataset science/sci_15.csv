Nasa SpaceX launch: Big day called off because of weather,"Poor weather has forced SpaceX to call off the launch of Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the International Space Station (ISS).The two men were due to go up from the Kennedy Space Center in what would have been the first orbital mission from the US in nine years.But unfavourable atmospheric conditions prompted controllers to call a stop just 16 minutes before lift-off.The next opportunity for SpaceX and Nasa will come on Saturday.If that's no good, there would be a third opportunity on Sunday.The frustration was that conditions just an hour after the designated launch time of 16:33 EDT were probably acceptable.But this was an instantaneous launch window where the SpaceX Falcon rocket and its Dragon crew capsule had to leave on time or they wouldn't be able to catch the space station. It meant everyone had to stand down, including President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, and VP Mike Pence and his wife, Karen. They'd all flown in to watch the historic launch.""I know there's a lot of disappointment today. The weather got us,"" reflected Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.  ""But this was a great day for Nasa and for SpaceX. Our teams worked together in a really impressive way, making good decisions all along. So, let's go; let's go get this done. Saturday is going to be a great day.""There is great interest in this mission. Not since the retirement of the shuttles in 2011 has America been able to launch its own astronauts into space - a big gap in which the US has had to rely on Russian Soyuz vehicles.But Hurley's and Behnken's mission is about more than just pride.Nasa is giving up its past practice of owning and operating the space systems it uses in low-Earth orbit and intends in future simply to buy crew transport services from the private sector - much like a company might outsource its payroll or HR needs. SpaceX is the first of these new service providers.Mr Bridenstine believes the approach will save his agency money that can then be spent on missions to the Moon and Mars.""We envision a future where low-Earth orbit is entirely commercialised, where Nasa is one customer of many customers, where we have numerous providers that are competing on cost, on innovation and safety,"" he said.""We are proving out a business model that ultimately will enable us to go to the Moon, this time sustainably. In other words, we're going to go to the Moon to stay.""Wednesday's launch attempt went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the site.As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks.Saturday's opportunity, if taken, will be at 15:22 EDT.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",27 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: What's the mission plan?,"On Wednesday, the California company SpaceX will launch a mission to the International Space Station (ISS). It's something the firm has done many times before, taking cargo to the sky-high laboratory. But on this occasion, the firm will be transporting people.It's one of those seminal moments in the history of spaceflight.When Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken lift off atop their Falcon-9 rocket, inside their Crew Dragon capsule, it will mark the first time humans have left US territory to reach low-Earth orbit in almost nine years. But more than that, it sees a shift to the commercialisation of human space transportation - of companies selling ""taxi"" rides to government and anyone else who wants to purchase the service.  This page details the key phases in the mission sequence.Launch will occur from the Kennedy Space Center's Complex 39A. This is the famous Florida pad from where the Apollo 11 moonwalkers and the very first shuttle, Columbia, also began their missions.Timing is precise. The Falcon must leave the ground at 16:33 EDT (20:33 GMT / 21:33 BST), or the astronauts won't be able to catch the ISS which passes overhead at 27,000km/h (17,000mph). Falcon-9 is a two-stage rocket. Its lower-segment will fire for 2.5 minutes before shutting down and separating. This will leave the second stage to burn for a further six minutes to get Dragon into orbit. Once detached, the capsule will then make the rest of the journey to the ISS using its own thrusters.The second stage of the rocket will be commanded to burn up in the atmosphere. The lower-segment of the booster aims to touch down on a drone ship in the Atlantic. This is a SpaceX speciality that sets its Falcon apart from all other orbital rockets in use today.It seems remarkable but Nasa astronauts have not had the use of a brand new spaceship design for 39 years. Not since John Young and Bob Crippen climbed aboard the Columbia orbiter. Their shuttle had dials, switches and a control stick. Dragon is all touchscreen. It's an automated vessel so it plots a path to ISS by itself, but Hurley and Behnken must practise manual flying in case there is some sort of anomaly.Dragon Capsule was conceived to handle every imagined scenario, including a failure of the rocket on the pad or in flight. If this happens, the ship will use a powerful in-built propulsion system to push itself to a safe distance. SpaceX has rehearsed this possibility both on the ground and in mid-air.This mission should see Dragon reach the ISS after about 19 hours of flight. The capsule will line itself up with the bow of the space station and approach at a relative speed of just a few centimetres per second. Once attached, hooks make an airtight seal.The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay aboard the 420km-high ISS is not yet fixed. It should be more than a couple of months but is unlikely to be longer than 120 days. Engineers say the solar cells on the Dragon degrade in orbit and so Nasa is sure to bring the crewmen home well before the hardware's performance is compromised.The descent to Earth won't be rushed. The astronauts plan a two-hour free-flight to further test onboard systems and procedures. When the de-orbit burn is eventually called, Dragon will be protected in its fall through the atmosphere by a heat shield. Four big parachutes will slow the spacecraft to a gentle splashdown in the Atlantic, just off the American coastline.SpaceX teams have gone over the process of retrieving the capsule many times.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",24 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Key questions about the mission,"Elon Musk's company SpaceX is about to launch its space vehicle - the Crew Dragon - with astronauts onboard for the first time. Here, we answer some common questions about the mission.Nasa has been planning to hand over the transport of crew to the International Space Station (ISS) since the early 2000s. After the Columbia space shuttle broke up during its return to Earth in 2003, the space agency focused on developing a replacement spaceship that could travel to the Moon. Involving private firms in the transfer of crew and cargo to the ISS was a necessary step to afford that programme. In 2014, entrepreneur Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing were announced as winners of a Nasa contract for crew transport services. SpaceX is launching its spacecraft first; the Crew Dragon spacecraft will lift off on Wednesday atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.Nasa SpaceX launch: How we got to this pointSpaceX is an American company that provides commercial and government launch services on its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. Entrepreneur Elon Musk founded the company in 2002, with the goal of reducing space transportation costs, enabling the colonisation of Mars. SpaceX was the first private company to routinely return rocket stages to Earth under propulsive power so they could be re-flown rather than being discarded. It has been conducting regular flights of cargo to the ISS, and will now aim to begin launching astronauts. Musk's company is also developing a bigger spacecraft to carry humans - called Starship - which could begin the process of settling Mars.Born in South Africa, Elon Musk made more than $160m from the sale of online payment service PayPal to eBay. His desire to see humanity become a true space-faring civilisation was a driving factor behind the founding of SpaceX. But he has also been involved in founding a variety of other companies such as the electric car manufacturer Tesla. He also conceived a project called Hyperloop, a high-speed transportation system using pods that travel through a system of tubes. His colourful personality and lifestyle made him the inspiration for Robert Downey Jr's interpretation of Marvel Comics character Tony Stark. Musk is no stranger to controversy: his tweets have triggered lawsuits and led to him being forced out as the chairman of Tesla (though he remained as CEO).Since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011, Nasa has been paying Russia tens of millions of dollars to launch its astronauts on the Soyuz spacecraft. The Crew Dragon launch from Florida marks the first launch of humans from US soil in nine years. As such, it is seen as crucial for restoring American prestige in human spaceflight. This will also be the first time a private company has launched astronauts into orbit.The Crew Dragon is the spacecraft that will transport astronauts to the ISS on Wednesday. It is a sleek evolution of the Dragon spacecraft which was built to ferry cargo to the orbiting outpost. The Crew Dragon is designed to carry a maximum of seven passengers, but Nasa flights will carry four, with the rest of the space taken up by supplies. It is equipped with thrusters that enable it to manoeuvre in space and will dock - or attach - to the space station under autonomous control. Unlike previous spacecraft designed for humans, the crew cabin features touchscreen controls in place of physical buttons.Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley are Nasa astronauts. They were selected in 2000 and have each flown to space twice on the space shuttle. They are among the most experienced members of Nasa's astronaut corps and both trained as test pilots - which has been critical for putting the new spacecraft through its paces. Hurley has spent a total of 28 days and 11 hours in space, while Behnken has accumulated a total of 29 days and 12 hours, including 37 hours of spacewalking time. Both men are also married to astronauts.Spacecraft designed to carry astronauts have to go through a process that ensures they can operate safely. This launch is essentially the final step in that validation process. Once in orbit, Behnken and Hurley will test the Crew Dragon's environmental control system, the displays and controls and the manoeuvring thrusters. They will monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station and will become members of the ISS crew. At the orbiting outpost, they will continue performing tests on the Crew Dragon along with other tasks related to the space station. When it's time to return to Earth, the Crew Dragon will parachute down into the Atlantic Ocean. The capsule and crew will then be recovered by a ship called Go Navigator.The Crew Dragon has a built-in abort system, designed to save the lives of its crew in the event of an emergency. If there's a problem during lift-off, such as a rocket engine cut-off, the Crew Dragon will fire engines to propel the vehicle and its occupants free of the rocket. The capsule will then parachute down to safety. SpaceX successfully conducted a test of its in-flight abort system on 19 January 2020.The flight suits that Behnken and Hurley will wear in the capsule look very different to previous designs. In stark contrast to the bulky pumpkin-coloured suits and round helmets familiar from the space shuttle era, SpaceX's suits are slimline, white, one-piece numbers with sleek, 3D-printed helmets. Each one is custom made for the astronaut. If they look like something from a science fiction movie, that's probably because their look was devised by Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez, who has worked on the Batman, X-Men and Thor movies. But the suits also have to be practical; they're designed to keep the crew alive in the event of a cabin depressurisation - where the air is lost from the inside of the spacecraft.Nasa SpaceX launch: Evolution of the spacesuitIf the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission is successful, SpaceX will proceed with the six ""operational"" missions to the ISS they are required to fly under their $2.6bn contract with Nasa. Boeing holds a similar deal, worth $4.2bn, to transport crew to the space station using its CST-100 Starliner vehicle.Follow Paul on Twitter.",23 May 2020,science

European contract signed for Moon mission hardware,"The European Space Agency has asked the aerospace company Airbus to build another service module for the Americans' Orion crew capsule.This contract, worth around €250m (£225m), is particularly noteworthy, however.That's because the hardware will be part of the mission that returns astronauts to the Moon's surface for the first time in 52 years.The European Service Module (ESM) can be thought of as the back end of Orion.It pushes the capsule through space, is responsible for its power supply and temperature control, and holds all the water and gases needed to sustain those riding onboard.The US space agency (Nasa) asked Esa to source Orion service modules to cement their ongoing partnership at the International Space Station (ISS) and to pull Europe into the missions that are planned to go beyond low-Earth orbit.Nasa has initiated what it calls the Artemis programme to go back to the lunar surface. The Esa/Airbus collaboration has already supplied a service module for the first of this project's missions, Artemis I.This will be an uncrewed test of Orion and its launch rocket, and is likely to take place in 2021.Artemis II will see astronauts board Orion for a loop around the Moon. An ESM for this flight is already under contract and in assembly. Artemis III will be the mission that attempts to make a landing. At the moment this is scheduled for 2024, and the newly contracted service module will be a key piece of mission hardware. The ESM's role will be to get Orion to the vicinity of the Moon and bring it safely back to Earth. Other components will be required for the descent and ascent phases of the surface operation. Airbus assembles the service modules at its Bremen facility in Germany.The design borrows heavily from the uncrewed cargo truck Europe used to run to the space station called the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV).At one time, Europe thought of adapting this truck into a human transportation system of its own, but ultimately baulked at the cost.Nonetheless, the performance and reliability of the ATV made it an ideal template for Orion's service module.Cylindrical in shape, the ESM is about 4m wide and tall, and weighs just over 13 tonnes. Airbus is now able to produce it at a substantially reduced cost. The contract for the very first module, signed in 2014, was valued at €390m.ESMs are given to the Americans as an in-kind contribution to cover the cost of European operations at the space station. But the clear hope from the European perspective is that the integral relationship built up on the capsule will eventually lead to an Esa astronaut being part of an Orion crew that goes to the Moon.The American capsules are developed by Lockheed Martin. Their procurement is separate to the commercial arrangement Nasa has with SpaceX and Boeing who are now contracted to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS. The agency merely purchases seats in these two US companies' vehicles, Dragon and Starliner. Orion, on the other hand, will be purchased, owned and operated by Nasa.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",26 May 2020,science
Dinosaur asteroid's trajectory was 'perfect storm',"A clear picture is emerging of why the asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago was so catastrophic.The space object, which wiped out 75% of all species including the dinosaurs, hit the worst possible place on the planet and - according to new research - at the most lethal angle.Investigations at the crater site, together with computer simulations, suggest the impactor dug into the crust at an inclination of up to 60 degrees.This exacerbated the climatic fallout.We know that the target rocks, in what is now the Gulf of Mexico, contained huge volumes of sulphur from the mineral gypsum. When this material was thrown high into the atmosphere and mixed with water vapour, it produced a ""global winter"".And the angle of attack ensured this environmental crisis was intense and prolonged.   ""At 45 to 60 degrees, the impact is very efficient at vaporising and ejecting debris to high altitude. If the impact happens at shallower or much steeper angles, the amount of material that's put into the atmosphere that can then have climate-changing effects is significantly less,"" explained Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London. ""It's evident that the nature of the location where this event happened, together with the impact angle, made for a perfect storm,"" he told BBC News.The majority of plant and animal life on Earth succumbed to the the challenging conditions.Prof Collins' and colleagues' work is published in the journal Nature Communications.Prof Collins is part of an international team that's been studying the anatomy of the crater associated with the calamitous asteroid strike. Today, this 200km-wide structure is positioned under Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, with its best preserved central portions sitting just offshore of the port of Chicxulub.It's hard to grasp the scale of the forces that produced it.The impactor, thought to be about 12km in diameter, punched an instantaneous hole in the crust that was probably some 30km deep. As fluidised rocks at the base of this bowl rebounded, they created in just a few minutes a mountain that was higher than Everest. This didn't last, however, and it fell back, to leave a prominent inner ring of hills, or peaks.What's interesting from Prof Collins' perspective is the asymmetry that was frozen into the Chicxulub structure.For example, if you look at the centres of the crater, of its peak ring and of the uplifted rock that underlies the crust in Earth's mantle - these points do not map directly on top of each other. They're actually aligned in a northeast-southwest direction, with the crater centre in between the centres of mantle uplift and peak-ring formation.This is a vital clue in determining not only the direction from which the asteroid arrived but the angle at which it hit the planet.The Imperial researcher ran a number of simulations on the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) DiRAC High Performance Computing Facility. The only way he can reproduce the geometry is by having the asteroid come in from the northeast and strike the Earth at an angle of roughly 60 degrees.Prof Collins said: ""If you run the model at different impact angles, at 30 degrees and at 45 degrees, say, you can't match the observations - you get centres of mantle uplift and of the peak ring on the downrange side of the crater centre. And for a straight overhead impact, at 90 degrees, the centres are all on top of each other. So, that's doesn't match the observations, either.""Imperial colleague and co-author Prof Joanna Morgan added: ""Knowing the direction of impact means we now know which part of the target site was subjected to the greatest shock pressures. ""The sulphur-bearing and carbon-bearing sedimentary rocks actually thicken as you go from east to west, and to the south. So this result means we're degassing more of those sediments than we would if you just took an average value for their thickness.""And Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US, told BBC News: ""This new modelling provides a clear answer to the angle of the impact and the direction of the impact that largely settles a long-standing debate on what was downrange of the impact.  ""Also critical is that a 60-degree angle is in the range of the worst options for injecting large volumes of vaporised and ejected sulphur-rich rocks into the atmosphere.  ""Thus these results are critical for understanding potential 'kill mechanisms',"" the co-author explained.Gulick and Morgan led the expedition that drilled into the Chicxulub Crater in 2016 to recover some of its rocks for an analysis. A follow-up, high-resolution seismic survey is due to take place late this summer that will provide an enhanced 3D view of the structure.The impact that changed life on EarthJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",26 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Big day called off because of weather,"Poor weather has forced SpaceX to call off the launch of Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the International Space Station (ISS).The two men were due to go up from the Kennedy Space Center in what would have been the first orbital mission from the US in nine years.But unfavourable atmospheric conditions prompted controllers to call a stop just 16 minutes before lift-off.The next opportunity for SpaceX and Nasa will come on Saturday.If that's no good, there would be a third opportunity on Sunday.The frustration was that conditions just an hour after the designated launch time of 16:33 EDT were probably acceptable.But this was an instantaneous launch window where the SpaceX Falcon rocket and its Dragon crew capsule had to leave on time or they wouldn't be able to catch the space station. It meant everyone had to stand down, including President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, and VP Mike Pence and his wife, Karen. They'd all flown in to watch the historic launch.""I know there's a lot of disappointment today. The weather got us,"" reflected Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.  ""But this was a great day for Nasa and for SpaceX. Our teams worked together in a really impressive way, making good decisions all along. So, let's go; let's go get this done. Saturday is going to be a great day.""There is great interest in this mission. Not since the retirement of the shuttles in 2011 has America been able to launch its own astronauts into space - a big gap in which the US has had to rely on Russian Soyuz vehicles.But Hurley's and Behnken's mission is about more than just pride.Nasa is giving up its past practice of owning and operating the space systems it uses in low-Earth orbit and intends in future simply to buy crew transport services from the private sector - much like a company might outsource its payroll or HR needs. SpaceX is the first of these new service providers.Mr Bridenstine believes the approach will save his agency money that can then be spent on missions to the Moon and Mars.""We envision a future where low-Earth orbit is entirely commercialised, where Nasa is one customer of many customers, where we have numerous providers that are competing on cost, on innovation and safety,"" he said.""We are proving out a business model that ultimately will enable us to go to the Moon, this time sustainably. In other words, we're going to go to the Moon to stay.""Wednesday's launch attempt went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the site.As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks.Saturday's opportunity, if taken, will be at 15:22 EDT.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",27 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: What's the mission plan?,"On Wednesday, the California company SpaceX will launch a mission to the International Space Station (ISS). It's something the firm has done many times before, taking cargo to the sky-high laboratory. But on this occasion, the firm will be transporting people.It's one of those seminal moments in the history of spaceflight.When Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken lift off atop their Falcon-9 rocket, inside their Crew Dragon capsule, it will mark the first time humans have left US territory to reach low-Earth orbit in almost nine years. But more than that, it sees a shift to the commercialisation of human space transportation - of companies selling ""taxi"" rides to government and anyone else who wants to purchase the service.  This page details the key phases in the mission sequence.Launch will occur from the Kennedy Space Center's Complex 39A. This is the famous Florida pad from where the Apollo 11 moonwalkers and the very first shuttle, Columbia, also began their missions.Timing is precise. The Falcon must leave the ground at 16:33 EDT (20:33 GMT / 21:33 BST), or the astronauts won't be able to catch the ISS which passes overhead at 27,000km/h (17,000mph). Falcon-9 is a two-stage rocket. Its lower-segment will fire for 2.5 minutes before shutting down and separating. This will leave the second stage to burn for a further six minutes to get Dragon into orbit. Once detached, the capsule will then make the rest of the journey to the ISS using its own thrusters.The second stage of the rocket will be commanded to burn up in the atmosphere. The lower-segment of the booster aims to touch down on a drone ship in the Atlantic. This is a SpaceX speciality that sets its Falcon apart from all other orbital rockets in use today.It seems remarkable but Nasa astronauts have not had the use of a brand new spaceship design for 39 years. Not since John Young and Bob Crippen climbed aboard the Columbia orbiter. Their shuttle had dials, switches and a control stick. Dragon is all touchscreen. It's an automated vessel so it plots a path to ISS by itself, but Hurley and Behnken must practise manual flying in case there is some sort of anomaly.Dragon Capsule was conceived to handle every imagined scenario, including a failure of the rocket on the pad or in flight. If this happens, the ship will use a powerful in-built propulsion system to push itself to a safe distance. SpaceX has rehearsed this possibility both on the ground and in mid-air.This mission should see Dragon reach the ISS after about 19 hours of flight. The capsule will line itself up with the bow of the space station and approach at a relative speed of just a few centimetres per second. Once attached, hooks make an airtight seal.The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay aboard the 420km-high ISS is not yet fixed. It should be more than a couple of months but is unlikely to be longer than 120 days. Engineers say the solar cells on the Dragon degrade in orbit and so Nasa is sure to bring the crewmen home well before the hardware's performance is compromised.The descent to Earth won't be rushed. The astronauts plan a two-hour free-flight to further test onboard systems and procedures. When the de-orbit burn is eventually called, Dragon will be protected in its fall through the atmosphere by a heat shield. Four big parachutes will slow the spacecraft to a gentle splashdown in the Atlantic, just off the American coastline.SpaceX teams have gone over the process of retrieving the capsule many times.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",24 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Key questions about the mission,"Elon Musk's company SpaceX is about to launch its space vehicle - the Crew Dragon - with astronauts onboard for the first time. Here, we answer some common questions about the mission.Nasa has been planning to hand over the transport of crew to the International Space Station (ISS) since the early 2000s. After the Columbia space shuttle broke up during its return to Earth in 2003, the space agency focused on developing a replacement spaceship that could travel to the Moon. Involving private firms in the transfer of crew and cargo to the ISS was a necessary step to afford that programme. In 2014, entrepreneur Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing were announced as winners of a Nasa contract for crew transport services. SpaceX is launching its spacecraft first; the Crew Dragon spacecraft will lift off on Wednesday atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.Nasa SpaceX launch: How we got to this pointSpaceX is an American company that provides commercial and government launch services on its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. Entrepreneur Elon Musk founded the company in 2002, with the goal of reducing space transportation costs, enabling the colonisation of Mars. SpaceX was the first private company to routinely return rocket stages to Earth under propulsive power so they could be re-flown rather than being discarded. It has been conducting regular flights of cargo to the ISS, and will now aim to begin launching astronauts. Musk's company is also developing a bigger spacecraft to carry humans - called Starship - which could begin the process of settling Mars.Born in South Africa, Elon Musk made more than $160m from the sale of online payment service PayPal to eBay. His desire to see humanity become a true space-faring civilisation was a driving factor behind the founding of SpaceX. But he has also been involved in founding a variety of other companies such as the electric car manufacturer Tesla. He also conceived a project called Hyperloop, a high-speed transportation system using pods that travel through a system of tubes. His colourful personality and lifestyle made him the inspiration for Robert Downey Jr's interpretation of Marvel Comics character Tony Stark. Musk is no stranger to controversy: his tweets have triggered lawsuits and led to him being forced out as the chairman of Tesla (though he remained as CEO).Since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011, Nasa has been paying Russia tens of millions of dollars to launch its astronauts on the Soyuz spacecraft. The Crew Dragon launch from Florida marks the first launch of humans from US soil in nine years. As such, it is seen as crucial for restoring American prestige in human spaceflight. This will also be the first time a private company has launched astronauts into orbit.The Crew Dragon is the spacecraft that will transport astronauts to the ISS on Wednesday. It is a sleek evolution of the Dragon spacecraft which was built to ferry cargo to the orbiting outpost. The Crew Dragon is designed to carry a maximum of seven passengers, but Nasa flights will carry four, with the rest of the space taken up by supplies. It is equipped with thrusters that enable it to manoeuvre in space and will dock - or attach - to the space station under autonomous control. Unlike previous spacecraft designed for humans, the crew cabin features touchscreen controls in place of physical buttons.Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley are Nasa astronauts. They were selected in 2000 and have each flown to space twice on the space shuttle. They are among the most experienced members of Nasa's astronaut corps and both trained as test pilots - which has been critical for putting the new spacecraft through its paces. Hurley has spent a total of 28 days and 11 hours in space, while Behnken has accumulated a total of 29 days and 12 hours, including 37 hours of spacewalking time. Both men are also married to astronauts.Spacecraft designed to carry astronauts have to go through a process that ensures they can operate safely. This launch is essentially the final step in that validation process. Once in orbit, Behnken and Hurley will test the Crew Dragon's environmental control system, the displays and controls and the manoeuvring thrusters. They will monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station and will become members of the ISS crew. At the orbiting outpost, they will continue performing tests on the Crew Dragon along with other tasks related to the space station. When it's time to return to Earth, the Crew Dragon will parachute down into the Atlantic Ocean. The capsule and crew will then be recovered by a ship called Go Navigator.The Crew Dragon has a built-in abort system, designed to save the lives of its crew in the event of an emergency. If there's a problem during lift-off, such as a rocket engine cut-off, the Crew Dragon will fire engines to propel the vehicle and its occupants free of the rocket. The capsule will then parachute down to safety. SpaceX successfully conducted a test of its in-flight abort system on 19 January 2020.The flight suits that Behnken and Hurley will wear in the capsule look very different to previous designs. In stark contrast to the bulky pumpkin-coloured suits and round helmets familiar from the space shuttle era, SpaceX's suits are slimline, white, one-piece numbers with sleek, 3D-printed helmets. Each one is custom made for the astronaut.

Today, this 200km-wide structure is positioned under Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, with its best preserved central portions sitting just offshore of the port of Chicxulub.It's hard to grasp the scale of the forces that produced it.The impactor, thought to be about 12km in diameter, punched an instantaneous hole in the crust that was probably some 30km deep. As fluidised rocks at the base of this bowl rebounded, they created in just a few minutes a mountain that was higher than Everest. This didn't last, however, and it fell back, to leave a prominent inner ring of hills, or peaks.What's interesting from Prof Collins' perspective is the asymmetry that was frozen into the Chicxulub structure.For example, if you look at the centres of the crater, of its peak ring and of the uplifted rock that underlies the crust in Earth's mantle - these points do not map directly on top of each other. They're actually aligned in a northeast-southwest direction, with the crater centre in between the centres of mantle uplift and peak-ring formation.This is a vital clue in determining not only the direction from which the asteroid arrived but the angle at which it hit the planet.The Imperial researcher ran a number of simulations on the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) DiRAC High Performance Computing Facility. The only way he can reproduce the geometry is by having the asteroid come in from the northeast and strike the Earth at an angle of roughly 60 degrees.Prof Collins said: ""If you run the model at different impact angles, at 30 degrees and at 45 degrees, say, you can't match the observations - you get centres of mantle uplift and of the peak ring on the downrange side of the crater centre. And for a straight overhead impact, at 90 degrees, the centres are all on top of each other. So, that's doesn't match the observations, either.""Imperial colleague and co-author Prof Joanna Morgan added: ""Knowing the direction of impact means we now know which part of the target site was subjected to the greatest shock pressures. ""The sulphur-bearing and carbon-bearing sedimentary rocks actually thicken as you go from east to west, and to the south.

European contract signed for Moon mission hardware,"The European Space Agency has asked the aerospace company Airbus to build another service module for the Americans' Orion crew capsule.This contract, worth around €250m (£225m), is particularly noteworthy, however.That's because the hardware will be part of the mission that returns astronauts to the Moon's surface for the first time in 52 years.The European Service Module (ESM) can be thought of as the back end of Orion.It pushes the capsule through space, is responsible for its power supply and temperature control, and holds all the water and gases needed to sustain those riding onboard.The US space agency (Nasa) asked Esa to source Orion service modules to cement their ongoing partnership at the International Space Station (ISS) and to pull Europe into the missions that are planned to go beyond low-Earth orbit.Nasa has initiated what it calls the Artemis programme to go back to the lunar surface. The Esa/Airbus collaboration has already supplied a service module for the first of this project's missions, Artemis I.This will be an uncrewed test of Orion and its launch rocket, and is likely to take place in 2021.Artemis II will see astronauts board Orion for a loop around the Moon. An ESM for this flight is already under contract and in assembly. Artemis III will be the mission that attempts to make a landing. At the moment this is scheduled for 2024, and the newly contracted service module will be a key piece of mission hardware. The ESM's role will be to get Orion to the vicinity of the Moon and bring it safely back to Earth. Other components will be required for the descent and ascent phases of the surface operation. Airbus assembles the service modules at its Bremen facility in Germany.The design borrows heavily from the uncrewed cargo truck Europe used to run to the space station called the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV).At one time, Europe thought of adapting this truck into a human transportation system of its own, but ultimately baulked at the cost.Nonetheless, the performance and reliability of the ATV made it an ideal template for Orion's service module.Cylindrical in shape, the ESM is about 4m wide and tall, and weighs just over 13 tonnes. Airbus is now able to produce it at a substantially reduced cost. The contract for the very first module, signed in 2014, was valued at €390m.ESMs are given to the Americans as an in-kind contribution to cover the cost of European operations at the space station. But the clear hope from the European perspective is that the integral relationship built up on the capsule will eventually lead to an Esa astronaut being part of an Orion crew that goes to the Moon.The American capsules are developed by Lockheed Martin. Their procurement is separate to the commercial arrangement Nasa has with SpaceX and Boeing who are now contracted to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS. The agency merely purchases seats in these two US companies' vehicles, Dragon and Starliner. Orion, on the other hand, will be purchased, owned and operated by Nasa.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",26 May 2020,science
Dinosaur asteroid's trajectory was 'perfect storm',"A clear picture is emerging of why the asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago was so catastrophic.The space object, which wiped out 75% of all species including the dinosaurs, hit the worst possible place on the planet and - according to new research - at the most lethal angle.Investigations at the crater site, together with computer simulations, suggest the impactor dug into the crust at an inclination of up to 60 degrees.This exacerbated the climatic fallout.We know that the target rocks, in what is now the Gulf of Mexico, contained huge volumes of sulphur from the mineral gypsum. When this material was thrown high into the atmosphere and mixed with water vapour, it produced a ""global winter"".And the angle of attack ensured this environmental crisis was intense and prolonged.   ""At 45 to 60 degrees, the impact is very efficient at vaporising and ejecting debris to high altitude. If the impact happens at shallower or much steeper angles, the amount of material that's put into the atmosphere that can then have climate-changing effects is significantly less,"" explained Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London. ""It's evident that the nature of the location where this event happened, together with the impact angle, made for a perfect storm,"" he told BBC News.The majority of plant and animal life on Earth succumbed to the the challenging conditions.Prof Collins' and colleagues' work is published in the journal Nature Communications.Prof Collins is part of an international team that's been studying the anatomy of the crater associated with the calamitous asteroid strike.

Nasa SpaceX launch: How we got to this point,"Elon Musk's SpaceX will launch people to the space station on Wednesday. But why is a private company sending astronauts into space for Nasa?To understand the background to this historic launch with the Crew Dragon spacecraft, we need to go back almost 20 years to a tragic accident.On 1 February 2003, the space shuttle Columbia broke apart while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. All seven astronauts aboard perished in the disaster.The loss of Columbia and its crew was the trigger for a dramatic shift in direction for America's human spaceflight programme.On 14 January 2004, President George W Bush announced that the space shuttle would be retired after completion of the International Space Station (ISS). In its place, America would build a new vehicle capable of returning astronauts to the Moon.The following year, Nasa chief Mike Griffin announced that the completion of the ISS would, for the first time, open up commercial opportunities for the routine transportation of cargo and astronauts to low-Earth orbit. This, Griffin reasoned, was required to free up enough funds to achieve a Moon return. Nasa established a Commercial Crew & Cargo Program Office (C3PO) to oversee the effort.The first part of this commercial vision - ferrying supplies and other cargo to the space station - would be fulfilled by SpaceX's original Dragon spacecraft and the Cygnus vehicle built by Orbital Sciences. In 2008, Barack Obama became president. His administration kicked off a review of the human spaceflight programme, which led to the cancellation of his predecessor's plan to return to the Moon (known as Constellation). However, the Obama administration favoured the continued commercialisation of space. After the space shuttle was retired, Nasa had to pay Russia tens of millions of dollars per seat to fly its astronauts to the ISS on the Soyuz vehicle, which launches from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.Congress was initially sceptical about the Commercial Crew Program and did not provide sufficient funds at first. But Charles Bolden, the astronaut who took over from Griffin as Nasa chief, persisted and eventually secured the support he needed.From their initial $50m Nasa investment in the programme in 2010, the space agency whittled several competing companies down to two - SpaceX and Boeing - in 2014.Since then, they have been refining and testing their spacecraft designs. It hasn't been plain sailing for either company, though. In 2016, a Falcon 9 rocket blew up on the launch pad. Then, in 2019, a Crew Dragon capsule exploded during testing on the ground. No one was hurt in either event.These mishaps and others introduced delays to a timeline which would originally have seen SpaceX launch crew to the space station in October 2016. Boeing experienced a timing anomaly during an uncrewed test flight last year that prevented it docking with the space station.But last year, SpaceX performed a triumphant launch of the Crew Dragon without astronauts. Using automated procedures, the capsule successfully approached and docked with the space station. It was carrying a mannequin called Ripley - after Ellen Ripley, the protagonist in the Alien movies - decked out with sensors to measure the G forces experienced during flight - particularly launch and landing. That mission, together with the successful test of the crew abort system, opened the door for today's historic flight from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.Follow Paul on Twitter.",27 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Evolution of the spacesuit,"The spacesuits worn by astronauts for the Crew Dragon mission have been getting a lot of attention. How do they differ from other attire worn by astronauts down the years?The futuristic flight suits worn by Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken for Wednesday's aborted launch look a world away from the bulky orange shuttle flight suits worn when astronauts last launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.The helmets are 3D-printed and the gloves are touchscreen-sensitive.But their primary purpose remains the same - to protect crew members from depressurisation, where air is lost from the capsule. They also provide ensure that astronauts have sufficient oxygen and regulate temperature. A communications link and breathable air are provided via a single ""umbilical"" cable in the seat that ""plugs in"" to the suit.The Starman suits, as they've been called, are all in one piece and customised for the astronaut. Their look was conceived by Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez, who has worked on Captain America: Civil War and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.But the suits are just designed for use inside the SpaceX capsule, known as the Crew Dragon. They're not suitable for use on spacewalks.Aerospace giant Boeing also has a contract with Nasa to carry astronauts to the space station in its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. It has also developed a pressure suit to protect astronauts during the key phases of launch and re-entry.The Boeing Blue suits  are about 40% lighter than earlier generations of spacesuits worn by American astronauts - and more flexible.It contains a series of different internal layers to keep astronauts cool. The suit also has touchscreen-sensitive gloves - so astronauts can work with tablets in the spacecraft. The suit's soft, hood-like helmet features a wide polycarbonate visor to give Starliner passengers better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space.Zips in the torso area will make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing.In October 2019, Nasa shared a close-up look at two next-generation suits for the agency's Artemis programme. Under this effort, Nasa will seek to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024, using the agency's Orion spacecraft.One of the suits is called the Orion Crew Survival System, and is comparable to the suits used by SpaceX and Boeing. It recalls the so-called Pumpkin suits used by space shuttle astronauts, but is more lightweight.The other suit, called the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) suit is designed to be worn on the surface of the Moon. It is much bulkier than the pressure suits designed to be worn inside spacecraft.This is because it needs to protect the wearer from temperature extremes outside the walls of the spacecraft, and provide some shielding against micrometeorites and other small particles of space debris. In that respect, it is similar to suits previously used for spacewalking at the International Space Station.There are two suits used for spacewalking at the ISS. One is the Russian Orlan type, which was first used in December 1977.The Orlan is a one-piece spacesuit. The ""backpack"" opens like a fridge door, allowing the spacewalker to climb inside.Nasa's Extravehicular Mobility Suit (EMU) was introduced in 1981 and is the other suit used for spacewalks at the ISS.Unlike the Orlan, the EMU comes in two separate pieces - a bottom and top half. The semi-rigid suit provides around 8.5 hours of life support for its wearer outside in the vacuum of space. Astronauts travelling to the ISS train with both the EMU and Orlan suits.The suits worn by Apollo astronauts on the Moon were also called the EMU. It was the result of years of development.Spacesuits have come a long way since the first spacewalk by the late cosmonaut Alexei Leonov in March 1965.Leonov's suit inflated after he stepped out into the vacuum, so that his hands came out of his gloves. Only by bleeding air out of the suit, which put the cosmonaut at risk of the bends, was he able to get back inside the spacecraft.The Crew Dragon spacecraft's next attempt at launch is set for Saturday at 15.22 EDT /20.22 BST from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.",28 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Who are the astronauts?,"On 27 May, two US astronauts will achieve a world first when they launch to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a spacecraft built by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Here, BBC News profiles the astronauts who will make the historic journey.Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are about to break a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011. In the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz.But officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program.Musk's vehicle will be first to fly; on Wednesday, Hurley and Behnken will travel to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft.""It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it,"" Hurley, 53, said earlier this month.Behnken, 49, added: ""On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him.""Nasa has chosen two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends.""Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that,"" says Hurley.When they blast off atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses will know exactly what they are going through. That's because they're astronauts too.Marine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel.Nyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas.""Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was,"" Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013.Air Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. As an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six.Hurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport.They ""can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be,"" Behnken told CNN earlier this month. ""We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands.""Hurley says of Behnken: ""I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face."" But Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two.The older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. ""It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college,"" Hurley said in 2009.Behnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010, he described it as ""a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood"", adding: ""I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person.""He took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him. Both men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines.They both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven.""When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker',"" said Hurley. ""But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table.""Hurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms.Thus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay.When the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as the prime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard.""Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point,"" Hurley said this month.They've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels.Hurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX.""That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them,"" he explained.Setbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016. ""We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made,"" explained Hurley.Despite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remains undimmed: ""It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship.""Hurley told CNN: ""From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree.""But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",24 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Key questions about the mission,"Elon Musk's company SpaceX is about to launch its space vehicle - the Crew Dragon - with astronauts onboard for the first time. Here, we answer some common questions about the mission.Nasa has been planning to hand over the transport of crew to the International Space Station (ISS) since the early 2000s. After the Columbia space shuttle broke up during its return to Earth in 2003, the space agency focused on developing a replacement spaceship that could travel to the Moon. Involving private firms in the transfer of crew and cargo to the ISS was a necessary step to afford that programme. In 2014, entrepreneur Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing were announced as winners of a Nasa contract for crew transport services. SpaceX is launching its spacecraft first; the Crew Dragon spacecraft will lift off on Wednesday atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.Nasa SpaceX launch: How we got to this pointSpaceX is an American company that provides commercial and government launch services on its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. Entrepreneur Elon Musk founded the company in 2002, with the goal of reducing space transportation costs, enabling the colonisation of Mars. SpaceX was the first private company to routinely return rocket stages to Earth under propulsive power so they could be re-flown rather than being discarded. It has been conducting regular flights of cargo to the ISS, and will now aim to begin launching astronauts. Musk's company is also developing a bigger spacecraft to carry humans - called Starship - which could begin the process of settling Mars.Born in South Africa, Elon Musk made more than $160m from the sale of online payment service PayPal to eBay. His desire to see humanity become a true space-faring civilisation was a driving factor behind the founding of SpaceX. But he has also been involved in founding a variety of other companies such as the electric car manufacturer Tesla. He also conceived a project called Hyperloop, a high-speed transportation system using pods that travel through a system of tubes. His colourful personality and lifestyle made him the inspiration for Robert Downey Jr's interpretation of Marvel Comics character Tony Stark. Musk is no stranger to controversy: his tweets have triggered lawsuits and led to him being forced out as the chairman of Tesla (though he remained as CEO).Since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011, Nasa has been paying Russia tens of millions of dollars to launch its astronauts on the Soyuz spacecraft. The Crew Dragon launch from Florida marks the first launch of humans from US soil in nine years. As such, it is seen as crucial for restoring American prestige in human spaceflight. This will also be the first time a private company has launched astronauts into orbit.The Crew Dragon is the spacecraft that will transport astronauts to the ISS on Wednesday. It is a sleek evolution of the Dragon spacecraft which was built to ferry cargo to the orbiting outpost. The Crew Dragon is designed to carry a maximum of seven passengers, but Nasa flights will carry four, with the rest of the space taken up by supplies. It is equipped with thrusters that enable it to manoeuvre in space and will dock - or attach - to the space station under autonomous control. Unlike previous spacecraft designed for humans, the crew cabin features touchscreen controls in place of physical buttons.Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley are Nasa astronauts. They were selected in 2000 and have each flown to space twice on the space shuttle. They are among the most experienced members of Nasa's astronaut corps and both trained as test pilots - which has been critical for putting the new spacecraft through its paces. Hurley has spent a total of 28 days and 11 hours in space, while Behnken has accumulated a total of 29 days and 12 hours, including 37 hours of spacewalking time. Both men are also married to astronauts.Spacecraft designed to carry astronauts have to go through a process that ensures they can operate safely. This launch is essentially the final step in that validation process. Once in orbit, Behnken and Hurley will test the Crew Dragon's environmental control system, the displays and controls and the manoeuvring thrusters. They will monitor the autonomous docking system during the approach to the space station and will become members of the ISS crew. At the orbiting outpost, they will continue performing tests on the Crew Dragon along with other tasks related to the space station. When it's time to return to Earth, the Crew Dragon will parachute down into the Atlantic Ocean. The capsule and crew will then be recovered by a ship called Go Navigator.The Crew Dragon has a built-in abort system, designed to save the lives of its crew in the event of an emergency. If there's a problem during lift-off, such as a rocket engine cut-off, the Crew Dragon will fire engines to propel the vehicle and its occupants free of the rocket. The capsule will then parachute down to safety. SpaceX successfully conducted a test of its in-flight abort system on 19 January 2020.The flight suits that Behnken and Hurley will wear in the capsule look very different to previous designs. In stark contrast to the bulky pumpkin-coloured suits and round helmets familiar from the space shuttle era, SpaceX's suits are slimline, white, one-piece numbers with sleek, 3D-printed helmets. Each one is custom made for the astronaut. If they look like something from a science fiction movie, that's probably because their look was devised by Hollywood costume designer Jose Fernandez, who has worked on the Batman, X-Men and Thor movies. But the suits also have to be practical; they're designed to keep the crew alive in the event of a cabin depressurisation - where the air is lost from the inside of the spacecraft.Nasa SpaceX launch: Evolution of the spacesuitIf the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission is successful, SpaceX will proceed with the six ""operational"" missions to the ISS they are required to fly under their $2.6bn contract with Nasa. Boeing holds a similar deal, worth $4.2bn, to transport crew to the space station using its CST-100 Starliner vehicle.Follow Paul on Twitter.",23 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: What's the mission plan?,"On Wednesday, the California company SpaceX will launch a mission to the International Space Station (ISS). It's something the firm has done many times before, taking cargo to the sky-high laboratory. But on this occasion, the firm will be transporting people.It's one of those seminal moments in the history of spaceflight.When Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken lift off atop their Falcon-9 rocket, inside their Crew Dragon capsule, it will mark the first time humans have left US territory to reach low-Earth orbit in almost nine years. But more than that, it sees a shift to the commercialisation of human space transportation - of companies selling ""taxi"" rides to government and anyone else who wants to purchase the service.  This page details the key phases in the mission sequence.Launch will occur from the Kennedy Space Center's Complex 39A. This is the famous Florida pad from where the Apollo 11 moonwalkers and the very first shuttle, Columbia, also began their missions.Timing is precise. The Falcon must leave the ground at 16:33 EDT (20:33 GMT / 21:33 BST), or the astronauts won't be able to catch the ISS which passes overhead at 27,000km/h (17,000mph). Falcon-9 is a two-stage rocket. Its lower-segment will fire for 2.5 minutes before shutting down and separating. This will leave the second stage to burn for a further six minutes to get Dragon into orbit. Once detached, the capsule will then make the rest of the journey to the ISS using its own thrusters.The second stage of the rocket will be commanded to burn up in the atmosphere. The lower-segment of the booster aims to touch down on a drone ship in the Atlantic. This is a SpaceX speciality that sets its Falcon apart from all other orbital rockets in use today.It seems remarkable but Nasa astronauts have not had the use of a brand new spaceship design for 39 years. Not since John Young and Bob Crippen climbed aboard the Columbia orbiter. Their shuttle had dials, switches and a control stick. Dragon is all touchscreen. It's an automated vessel so it plots a path to ISS by itself, but Hurley and Behnken must practise manual flying in case there is some sort of anomaly.Dragon Capsule was conceived to handle every imagined scenario, including a failure of the rocket on the pad or in flight. If this happens, the ship will use a powerful in-built propulsion system to push itself to a safe distance. SpaceX has rehearsed this possibility both on the ground and in mid-air.This mission should see Dragon reach the ISS after about 19 hours of flight. The capsule will line itself up with the bow of the space station and approach at a relative speed of just a few centimetres per second. Once attached, hooks make an airtight seal.The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay aboard the 420km-high ISS is not yet fixed. It should be more than a couple of months but is unlikely to be longer than 120 days. Engineers say the solar cells on the Dragon degrade in orbit and so Nasa is sure to bring the crewmen home well before the hardware's performance is compromised.The descent to Earth won't be rushed. The astronauts plan a two-hour free-flight to further test onboard systems and procedures. When the de-orbit burn is eventually called, Dragon will be protected in its fall through the atmosphere by a heat shield. Four big parachutes will slow the spacecraft to a gentle splashdown in the Atlantic, just off the American coastline.SpaceX teams have gone over the process of retrieving the capsule many times.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",24 May 2020,science
Covid recovery could 'tip the balance' for nature,"Environmental scientists have called for the conservation of nature to be at the centre of the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.With countries still ensnared by the crisis, scientists have urged governments to make plans that ""safeguard biodiversity and human health"" as they rebuild. The researchers published an open letter in the journal Science.""How we emerge from lockdowns,"" they say, ""will drive a new world economy."" This is likely to have lasting effects on global biodiversity, the Australian authors argue.The right long-term plans, from governments and international organisations, could ""tip the balance"" in favour of nature. There are some striking examples of upheavals that have had unintended benefits for nature. The catastrophic nuclear accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine, and the resulting exclusion zone around the plant, created an unplanned wilderness that has since been designated an ecological reserve. ""The Colombia Conflict, for example, created unofficial protected areas,"" explained Dr Ryan Pearson from Griffith University in Queensland, Australia. ""This slowed environmental degradation because people were fearful of entering remote areas occupied by rebels.""The more recent ""post-conflict"" increase in deforestation there shows the need for longer-term strategies that can maintain the positive side effects of crises.""There have been many reports of wild animals increasing in numbers and turning up in places they haven't been seen i a long time,"" Dr Pearson told BBC News. "" This carries implications that certain species may be benefiting from the absence of human influence during lockdowns or possibly because of reduced pollution, especially in waterways.""We can't be sure how long such effects will last unless long-term strategies are implemented to encourage them.""There is, the scientists say, a concern that the rush to re-stabilise and grow economies may come ""at the expense of the environment"".This group of environmental scientists are adding their voices to a call for a greener focus as the world rebuilds. Dr Pearson added: ""We hope our letter will encourage positive strategies to support biodiversity into legislation, and the behaviour of people in their choices - in their consumption, investment, and travel.""Follow Victoria on Twitter.",21 May 2020,science
Climate change: Top 10 tips to reduce carbon footprint revealed,"Climate change can still be tackled – but only if people are willing to embrace major shifts in the way we live, a report says.The authors have put together a list of the best ways for people to reduce their carbon footprints.The response to the Covid-19 crisis has shown that the public is willing to accept radical change if they consider it necessary, they explain.And the report adds that government priorities must be re-ordered.Protecting the planet must become the first duty of all decision-makers, the researchers argue.The authors urge the public to contribute by adopting the carbon-cutting measures in the report, which is based on an analysis of 7,000 other studies.Top of the list is living car-free, which saves an average of 2.04 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually. This is followed by driving a battery electric car - 1.95 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person annually - and taking one less long-haul flight each year - 1.68 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person.Switching to a vegan diet will help - but less than tackling transport, the research shows.It says popular activities such as recycling are worthwhile, but don’t cut emissions by as much.The lead author, Dr Diana Ivanova from Leeds University, told BBC News: “We need a complete change of mindset. “We have to agree how much carbon we can each emit within the limits of what the planet can bear – then make good lives within those boundaries.“The top 10 options are available to us now, without the need for controversial and expensive new technologies.” Dr Ivanova said the coronavirus lockdown has shown that many people could live without cars if public transport, walking and cycling were improved.Her research highlights rich people who typically take more flights, drive bigger cars and consume the most. She said: “All the world suffers from climate change, but it’s not the average person who flies regularly – it’s a small group, yet aviation is under-taxed. It’s a moral issue.”In her league table, buying renewable power and using public transport rank fourth and fifth.Sixth is insulating your home well, which saves 0.895 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.Seventh is switching to a vegan diet, which saves 0.8 tonnes. Other top actions are using heat pumps; switching from polluting cookstoves (in developing countries) to better methods of cooking, and heating buildings with renewable energy. Dr Ivanova said that if people implemented the measures, it would save around nine tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per person per year.Current annual household emissions are around 10 tonnes in the UK, and 17 in the US.The study, out soon in the journal Environmental Research Letters, says the following are worthwhile, but of lesser benefit to the climate: green roofs; using less paper; buying more durable items; turning down the thermostat - and recycling, which saves 0.01 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year, according to Dr Ivanova.Some of the findings will be questioned. Polls suggest some people think climate is as important as the virus, for instance, but some don’t.Professor Tommy Wiedmann from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said: “This is a valuable study. But it only looks at the carbon footprint and not at other impacts like water scarcity because of lithium mining for electric car batteries.Libby Peake, from the Green Alliance think tank, told BBC News: “People shouldn’t stop good habits like recycling, which saves some carbon while preventing waste and conserving resources.”  “Better design allows people to buy fewer but higher-quality things and to live in buildings with lower carbon footprints. These savings aren’t necessarily covered by this study.” Follow Roger on Twitter.",20 May 2020,science
Climate change: Scientists fear car surge will see CO2 rebound,"Daily global emissions of CO2 fell by 17% at the peak of the shutdown because of measures taken by governments in response to Covid-19, say scientists.The most comprehensive account yet published says that almost half the record decrease was due to fewer car journeys. But the authors are worried that, as people return to work, car use will soar again.They fear CO2 emissions could soon be higher than before the crisis.They are urging politicians to grasp the moment and make real, durable changes on transport and personal mobility.In the UK, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged £250m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure. Other countries are also looking at similar plans.The lockdowns that most governments have implemented in response to Covid-19 have had a significant impact on the carbon-producing activities that are embedded in almost everything we do.Road transport has declined hugely, as has aviation. However, now that the UK is beginning to return to work, Mr Shapps said people should drive to work rather than use public transport, should walking or cycling not be an option.""If you can't walk or cycle but you do have access to a car, please use it rather than travelling by bus, train or tram,"" he said.Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for energy all over the world has crashed. Now in detailed analysis, researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our emissions of CO2.They've calculated the fall off in carbon based on the lockdown policies implemented in 69 countries that between them account for 97% of global emissions.During the peak of the crisis in early April, daily emissions dropped by 17% compared to the previous year, meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day.The key to the fall has been cars. Surface transport emissions have declined by 43%, the same amount as the drop from industry and power generation combined. While the aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for the economic impact, it only accounts for 10% of the decrease during the pandemic. China has been responsible for the biggest drop, followed by the US, Europe and India.If some restrictions on economic activity stay in place worldwide until the end of the year, then global emissions will likely drop by 7%. If pre-pandemic levels of transport and economic activity return by mid-June, the annual fall would be around 4%. But the research team that carried out this work is concerned that the rebound, especially on the roads, could see a carbon surge.Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants, too. One of the UK's leading experts, Prof Frank Kelly, from King's College London, said he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two years before US authorities exposed the scandal.He told Radio 4's The Life Scientific programme that his team discovered a huge mismatch between emissions declared by the car firms and real readings on the road.Prof Kelly said he reported it to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but they didn't publish his findings. He said work undertaken subsequently in the US led to legal action against car makers that had installed ""defeat devices"" to fool regulators.The government didn't deny the account. A spokesperson said: ""We are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by the World Health Organization as an 'example for the rest of the world to follow'"".Meanwhile, on the Covid-19 crisis, he said levels of the pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60% in London since the fall in traffic under lockdown.Levels of another pollutant, sooty particles, remained at harmful concentrations.""A big worry that people will naturally want to go back to their cars to go to work, and that could rebound the emissions to the same level or even higher than before, once everybody goes back,"" said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia, who led the analysis.The researchers say that fundamental, systemic change is needed if the emissions curve is to be flattened in a way that would limit the very worst impacts of climate change. When it comes to transportation, there are huge opportunities, according to Prof Le Quéré. She says that after the global financial crisis in 2008, some governments like China, US and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar energy and this drove down the prices of these renewables. ""Here now in 2020 we're very close to the same situation in electric mobility,"" she told BBC News.""Battery prices have come down, we have lots of models and governments are going to try to boost their economies.""""So if these two things can align, then it could make a huge difference to the transportation of tomorrow.""Grabbing the opportunity that the virus has presented is also at the forefront of corporate thinking on climate change. A letter signed by 155 major companies, representing $2.4 trillion (£1.96 trillion) in market capitalisation, calls for a net-zero emissions response to the covid crisis. Corporations including Carlsberg, Iberdrola, EDF and Coca Cola Europe say they want governments to ""prioritise a faster and fairer transition from a grey to a green economy"".The authors of the latest analysis on carbon emissions agree that now is the moment for action. They point to the fact that while emissions of CO2 may be temporarily reduced, all the while CO2 concentrations are lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet.It will take a a dramatic shift to change that. ""I think very much that we are at a crossroads. And at this point, like the UK prime minister Boris Johnson said, it could go either way.""""He was talking about his own health, but here we're talking about the health of the planet.""""It could go either way.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Follow Matt on Twitter.",19 May 2020,science
Antarctic algal blooms: 'Green snow' mapped from space,"UK scientists have created the first wide-area maps of microscopic algae growing in coastal Antarctica.Satellite observations were used to count nearly 1,700 patches where large blooms had turned snow cover green.The team says the photosynthesising organisms are an important ""sink"" for pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.They are also key actors in the cycling of nutrients in what is one the most remote regions on Earth.""These are primary producers at the bottom of a food chain. If there are changes in the algae, it obviously has knock-on effects further up the food chain,"" explained study leader Dr Matt Davey from Cambridge University.""And even though the numbers we're talking about are small on a global scale, on an Antarctic scale they're substantially important,"" the ecologist, who has since joined the Scottish Association for Marine Science in Oban, told BBC News.Detecting the green algae from space was a tricky task. While it's easy to spot the organisms' discolouration when walking in the snow on the ground, from orbit it becomes much harder to tease out the blooms' signal against what is a highly reflective surface.Fortunately for the team, the European Union's Sentinel-2 spacecraft have high-fidelity detectors that are sensitive in just the right part of the light spectrum to make the observation. The study mapped the Antarctic Peninsula, the finger of land which points up from the White Continent towards South America. The blooms are seen predominantly to be on the western side of this feature. Two-thirds were on the many islands that dot the coastline. Totalled, the microscopic algae covered an area of almost 2 sq km. It means they're tying up roughly 500 tonnes of carbon a year. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon that would be emitted by about 875,000 average petrol car journeys in the UK, the team calculates.These numbers are an underestimate because the Sentinel-2 system is only picking up green algae and missing their red and orange counterparts - an issue of the satellite camera detectors' spectral bands not being sensitive at just the right wavelengths for those particular blooms.""It's frustrating because we've shown how to do it on the WorldView-3 spacecraft but its imagery is just too expensive. Sentinel is free,"" explained Dr Andrew Gray, who is affiliated to both Cambridge and the NERC Field Spectroscopy Facility in Edinburgh.The problem would be resolved in time as more open-data satellites were launched, the remote-sensing specialist added. Algal blooms in the Antarctic were first described by expeditions in the 1950s and 1960s. They can look spectacular when they tinge slopes with a broad swathe of colour to contrast the surrounding white. This makes them a popular subject for cruise ship tourists and their cameras.To flourish, the organisms need an available supply of liquid water and that's to be found in snowy areas just above freezing, as opposed to those places of deep cold and ice.The blooms' distribution is also heavily influenced by the proximity of seals, penguins and other Antarctic birds, such as skuas and kelp gulls. The ""poop"" from these creatures is a source of essential nitrogen and other elements. The interesting question is what happens to the blooms as the Antarctic warms. Temperatures on the peninsula rose rapidly in the latter half of the 20th Century, and climate models expect this trend to continue in coming decades.Many of the algal fields on low-lying islands could simply disappear if their snows are completely removed. On the other hand, new opportunities are likely to open up on the mainland, further to the south and at higher elevations.""There are probably many different species of algae, all with quite different niches. Some will live right at the top of the snow surface, others quite a bit deeper - and their numbers will change depending on the temperature,"" observed Prof Alison Smith, a biologist at Cambridge.       ""But we don't know yet whether their numbers will increase or decrease. And if you don't monitor the situation, you'll never know,"" she told BBC News.The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, involved additional team-members from the British Antarctic Survey and Edinburgh University.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",20 May 2020,science
Project seeks super view of Earth's mantle,"Some of the most sophisticated models of the Earth's interior ever constructed will be produced in a new project led from Cardiff University. Researchers want to simulate the behaviour of the mantle.This solid rock layer, which resides between the planet's core and crust, moves very slowly over time - roughly at the speed that a fingernail grows.The scientists will investigate its complex pattern of upwellings and downwellings.The team hopes its new circulation models will provide fresh insights into how the mantle has influenced the Earth's surface over hundreds of millions of years.""In the same way that the study of DNA has given us a whole new framework to understand biology, evolution and even this coronavirus we now face - so I want to look to the interior of the Earth to better understand how our planet, our single and sole 'spaceship', really works,"" project leader Prof Huw Davies told BBC News.Everyone is now familiar with plate tectonics - the description of how the rigid outer shell of our planet (its lithosphere) moves and is recycled.Great strides have been made in developing this theory in the 50 years since it came to prominence.For example, early ideas suggested the plates simply rode convection cells in the mantle like groceries on a supermarket check-out belt.   But we can now see that it's actually the weight of the ocean plates where they underthrust the continents that plays the major role in driving this remarkable system.Cold, dense rock at plate margins pulls on everything behind as it sinks into the mantle. And like the slinky dog that's started its journey downstairs, it needs little encouragement to maintain the momentum.Nonetheless, what goes down is coming back up because the heat of the interior has to be managed and redistributed.The new project will focus on the where and how of the upwellings, mapping the different regions of temperature, density, and velocity. Its supercomputer simulations will be constrained by state of the art knowledge in rock physics, chemistry and magnetism. Thanks to seismology, the study of how waves of energy from quakes move through the Earth, we have a very good picture of what the planet's interior looks like today. And the team's models, when they're run forwards and backwards, will have to reproduce this anchoring snapshot.The goal, says Prof Davies, is to get an accurate representation of behaviour back to about one billion years into the past.A key target is to understand the upwellings that ultimately result in ""hotspots"" at the Earth's surface - the places where there have been colossal outpourings of lava and gas through geologic history.""These are what we call the Large Igneous Provinces, or LIPs,"" explained Prof Davies. ""There hasn't been anything like this since the Columbia River flood basalts in North America just over 10 million years ago. So, they're rare. And thank goodness, because they can be absolutely catastrophic. ""The Siberian Traps which cover a large part of west Siberia match up with the largest extinction on Earth. A lot of the great extinction events are linked to these LIPs.""The £3m project is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and will run for four years.Prof Davies' team has members from the universities of Bristol, Cambridge, Oxford, Leeds, Liverpool, Imperial College London, Royal Holloway University of London, and University College London - in addition to Cardiff.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",18 May 2020,science
Social distancing: When extreme weather and coronavirus collide,"People being displaced by extreme weather events around the world are being forced to break Covid-19 social distancing safety guidelines, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and other humanitarian agencies.“Social distancing is no longer possible when displaced people are in evacuation centres,” Marshal Makavure, emergency operations co-ordinator of IFRC in Eastern Africa told the BBC.“People have been forced to break the Covid-19 protocol and guidelines under such circumstances.”The BBC has spoken with people living in areas affected by extreme weather events.Subrat Kumar Padhihary, a 38-year-old farmer in Odisha state on India’s east coast, is worried.Indian officials are on alert as Cyclone Amphan, due to hit West Bengal and Odisha on Wednesday, looks likely to intensify into a ""very severe"" storm.Subrat’s village is nearly 40 kilometres from the sea. The house that he shares with his wife, three daughters and mother was badly damaged by Cyclone Fani last year, so he isn’t convinced it can withstand Cyclone Amphan.But even if his house survives, he’s worried about having to leave his village if the authorities say people must evacuate.Subrat feels that might be even more dangerous.“My fear is that we will be taken to nearby schools that have already been turned into Covid-19 quarantine shelters.“There are not many centres in our village, and that means we will have to share the space with people [who may have Covid-19] which will be full of risks.”“West Bengal state has been struggling with Covid-19 cases and that is a cause of concern when it comes to cyclone preparedness,” according to Siddarth Srinivas, food and climate policy lead for Oxfam in Asia.“In the past, some states in India have rescued people by sheltering them in schools and public buildings, but this time doing that is not ideal because of the pandemic.”The Kasese district in western Uganda has been one of the worst hit by recent floods, with hundreds of people displaced.Joseline Kabugho is six months pregnant. The 23 year old has been forced to shelter with her two children in one of the school-turned-camps in the district.She’s staying at the shelter, even though her pregnancy means she is in a high-risk group when it comes to Covid-19 infection. There are nearly 200 displaced people with her at the shelter.“We are so vulnerable now,” she said from a class shared with three other families, which is now her family’s temporary home. “I can’t stay away from other people because of the limited space.“I am worried that I may get the virus, and I am worried about my kids, and my unborn baby,” she told the BBC.Joseline was sleeping next to her two children on the night of 7 May, when she heard other people in her village screaming.“I realised later on that my neighbours were actually telling me to run for my life. The entire village had been hit by a massive flood.“I grabbed my two kids and ran away, I had no time to take anything else.""She had bought some clothes for her unborn baby before the floods. “I could not even save those clothes. The floods took them all.“Whatever we had was swept away.""Her husband works in another district and he has been unable to travel due to Covid-19 restrictions. “I have nowhere to go and I don’t know what to do next.”Relief workers with the Red Cross say thousands of people are now sheltering in churches and schools in flood-hit East Africa with limited access to water and soap.Hundreds have died and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the floods in more than a half a dozen countries.More than 2,700 Covid-19 deaths and nearly 82,000 confirmed cases have been recorded in Africa, according to John Hopkins University.Among the flood affected countries in East Africa, Somalia has the highest death figure of 55, followed by 50 in Kenya and 21 in Tanzania.Tropical cyclone Harold hit Pacific island countries more than a month ago.Some affected countries had to lift Covid-19 restrictions to allow people to take refuge in evacuation centres. Some people are still in evacuation centres now because the pandemic is affecting aid efforts.The worst-hit country, Vanuatu, has extended the state of emergency as more than 92,000 people have been affected, according to Unicef.In Fiji, about 10 evacuation centres are operating because recovery has been very slow and many houses are yet to be rebuilt.“Access to water is still a big challenge as the cyclone has destroyed water supply infrastructures,” said Vani Catanasiga, director of Fiji Council of Social Services.“Without adequate water supply, following Covid-19 hygiene guidelines is very difficult, although the Fijian government has been successful in flattening the Covid-19 infection curve.”Humanitarian agencies say relief operations can help in enforcing Covid-19 guidelines.Red Cross relief worker Irene Nakasiits is distributing water and soap as essentials to the flood-displaced communities in western Uganda.“Although it is challenging to do so, we can still remind affected communities to follow the guidelines,” according to Marshal Mukuvare of the IFRC.“We can have messages written on food and other relief materials, which we distribute in affected places.“This helps people do what they can, even in such adverse conditions.”It’s uncharted territory, according to Siddarth Srinivas, Food and Climate policy lead for Oxfam in Asia. “When it comes to how to deal with extreme weather and a pandemic like Covid-19, the debate has just started.“It needs much more thinking before we come up with solid measures.”  ",20 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Big day called off because of weather,"Poor weather has forced SpaceX to call off the launch of Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the International Space Station (ISS).The two men were due to go up from the Kennedy Space Center in what would have been the first orbital mission from the US in nine years.But unfavourable atmospheric conditions prompted controllers to call a stop just 16 minutes before lift-off.The next opportunity for SpaceX and Nasa will come on Saturday.If that's no good, there would be a third opportunity on Sunday.The frustration was that conditions just an hour after the designated launch time of 16:33 EDT were probably acceptable.But this was an instantaneous launch window where the SpaceX Falcon rocket and its Dragon crew capsule had to leave on time or they wouldn't be able to catch the space station. It meant everyone had to stand down, including President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, and VP Mike Pence and his wife, Karen. They'd all flown in to watch the historic launch.""I know there's a lot of disappointment today. The weather got us,"" reflected Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine.  ""But this was a great day for Nasa and for SpaceX. Our teams worked together in a really impressive way, making good decisions all along. So, let's go; let's go get this done. Saturday is going to be a great day.""There is great interest in this mission. Not since the retirement of the shuttles in 2011 has America been able to launch its own astronauts into space - a big gap in which the US has had to rely on Russian Soyuz vehicles.But Hurley's and Behnken's mission is about more than just pride.Nasa is giving up its past practice of owning and operating the space systems it uses in low-Earth orbit and intends in future simply to buy crew transport services from the private sector - much like a company might outsource its payroll or HR needs. SpaceX is the first of these new service providers.Mr Bridenstine believes the approach will save his agency money that can then be spent on missions to the Moon and Mars.""We envision a future where low-Earth orbit is entirely commercialised, where Nasa is one customer of many customers, where we have numerous providers that are competing on cost, on innovation and safety,"" he said.""We are proving out a business model that ultimately will enable us to go to the Moon, this time sustainably. In other words, we're going to go to the Moon to stay.""Wednesday's launch attempt went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the site.As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks.Saturday's opportunity, if taken, will be at 15:22 EDT.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",27 May 2020,science
