Demands grow for 'green industrial revolution',"Greenpeace has joined a growing list of organisations demanding that the UK government puts protecting the environment at the heart of any post-Covid-19 economic stimulus package.The campaign group has produced a detailed ""manifesto"" with measures to boost clean transport and smart power.The document follows a comparable call from some of Britain's most powerful business leaders earlier this week. Last week, the prime minister also expressed a similar ambition.Boris Johnson said he wanted to see a ""fairer, greener and more resilient global economy"" after Covid-19 and that ""we owe it to future generations to build back better"". The manifesto also contains measures to support the protection of nature, green buildings and the creation of an economy in which virtually everything is reused.Greenpeace says the crisis has given Britain a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to transform life, travel and work.It added that the plan would create hundreds of thousands of secure jobs.On Monday, more than 200 chief executives of some of the UK's top firms - including HSBC, National Grid, and Heathrow airport - signed a letter to the prime minister asking him to use the Covid-19 lockdown as a springboard to ""deliver a clean, just recovery"".Many people may be surprised how similar the recommendations of these two very different interest groups are. Greenpeace's manifesto is, however, considerably more detailed.It is a 62-page document with specific policy, spending and tax measures covering most of the British economy.It calls on the government to deliver its 2050 net zero emissions goal before 2045.Many voters say they support tackling climate change when polled.However, lots of the policies Greenpeace proposes would prove very controversial. For example, motorists say they are ready to change their behaviour to improve air quality, according to a recent AA survey.  But many drivers may balk at Greenpeace's proposals to radically redesign the road network to favour walking and cycling, at the suggestion that petrol and diesel cars are banned by 2030 or that fuel duty is steadily increased.Many homeowners might be reluctant to spend money to upgrade their properties to meet tough energy efficiency standards.At the same time, many local communities are likely to resist the plan for a big increase in onshore wind and solar power to complement a proposed massive expansion of offshore wind farms - few things unite local communities like a proposal to put in an array of wind turbines.But, says Greenpeace, tough policies like these are essential if the government is going to take meaningful action to tackle climate change.""The choices our government makes now will define… whether or not we succeed in the fight against the climate emergency"", says John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace.""If we fail to get this right, we may never get another chance. Now is the time for a green recovery, and for that we need action not words.""It says there would be huge dividends in terms of job creation, should its programme be adopted.Greenpeace calculates that its plans would create hundreds of thousands of new high-skilled jobs as well as helping to level up inequalities between communities in the UK.The UK government has already indicated that protecting the environment will feature heavily in any stimulus package.Back in April, Boris Johnson said a post-Covid-19 recovery plans should include efforts to ""turn the tide on climate change"".Meanwhile, the European Union has unveiled what it called the biggest ""green"" stimulus in history.Last week, it said it planned to commit a whopping €750bn (£667bn; $841bn) to its recovery package.Add in spending from future budgets and the total financial firepower the European Commission says it will be wielding is almost €2tn (£1.8tn; $2.2tn).Fighting climate change is at the heart of the bloc's recovery from the pandemic. There will be tens of billions of euros to make homes more energy efficient, to de-carbonise electricity and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.The idea is to turbo-charge the European effort to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.""If we do not do it, we will be taking much more risk,"" Teresa Ribera, deputy prime minister of Spain, told the BBC.""The recovery should be green or it will not be a recovery, it will just be a shortcut into the kind of problems we are facing right now.""Follow Justin on Twitter.",4 June 2020,science

Climate change: older trees loss continue around the world,"Older, carbon-rich tropical forests continue to be lost at a frightening rate, according to satellite data. In 2019, an area of primary forest the size of a football pitch was lost every six seconds, the University of Maryland study of trees more than 5 metres says.Brazil accounted for a third of it, its worst loss in 13 years apart from huge spikes in 2016 and 2017 from fires.However, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo both managed to reduce tree loss.Meanwhile, Australia saw a sixfold rise in total tree loss, following dramatic wildfires late in 2019, .As well as storing massive amounts of carbon, primary, tropical rainforests, where trees can be hundreds or even thousands of years old, are home to species such as orangutans and tigers.The tropics lost 11.9 million hectares (46,000 square miles) of tree cover, the study found, 3.8 million in older, primary forest areas - the third highest loss of primary trees since 2000 and a slight increase on 2018.""The level of forest loss that we saw in 2019 is unacceptable,"" Frances Seymour, from the World Resources Institute, said. ""And one of the reasons that it's unacceptable is that we actually already know how to turn it around.""If governments put into place good policies and enforce the law, forest loss goes down. ""But if governments relax restrictions on burning, or [are] signalling that they intend to open up indigenous territories for commercial exploration, forest loss goes up.""Speaking about the losses in Brazil, Mikaela Weisse, from Global Forest Watch, said: ""We also noted several new hotspots of primary forest loss within indigenous territories, especially in the state of Pará that were linked to land grabbing and to mining.""These incursions are particularly worrisome given that indigenous peoples have been some of the best conservers of forests in Brazil and around the world.""Indonesia, however, saw losses remain at historically low levels for the third year in a row, thanks, it seems, to strong government action.Liz Goldman, from Global Forest Watch, said: ""A number of policies in Indonesia have contributed to this positive story, including increased enforcement to prevent forest fires and land clearing and a forest moratorium to prevent new clearing for oil palm plantations and logging activities, which was first established in 2011 and made permanent just this past year."" And Columbia, which had seen tree losses surge since a peace agreement came into force in 2016, saw a 35% drop in primary forest loss compared with 2018.But Bolivia saw losses 80% greater than any other year, after fires set for agricultural clearing spread out of control.And nearly 12% of the Chiquitano dry forest, in eastern Bolivia, home to indigenous peoples, jaguars, giant armadillos and tapirs, was burned.

Extinction crisis 'poses existential threat to civilisation',"Human impacts on the places on Earth with the most richness of life have brought hundreds of wild animals to the brink of extinction, a study shows.The likes of logging and poaching have pushed 500 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians to the point where they're hanging by a thread, research found.This is yet more evidence that the world's undergoing a sixth mass extinction, scientists argue.Species are disappearing at more than 100 times the natural rate, they say. And unlike other mass extinctions, caused by volcano eruptions or asteroid collisions, we only have ourselves to blame.Prof Gerardo Ceballos of the National University of Mexico in Mexico City, said regional ecosystems are facing collapse. ""We have entered the sixth mass extinction,"" he told BBC News. ""Based on our research and what we're seeing, the extinction crisis is so bad that whatever we do in the next 10 to 50 years is what will define the future of humanity.""Prof Ceballos worked on the study with two other well-known conservation scientists, Stanford University's Prof Paul Erhlich, and Dr Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St Louis, US.Using data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened species and Birdlife (the bird authority for the IUCN), they identified at least 515 species that are on the brink of extinction, with fewer than a thousand individuals left. The animals are found on every continent save Antarctica, in places highly impacted by humans, primarily in the tropics and subtropics.They include the Golden Lion Tamarin, Ethiopian Wolf, Javan Rhinoceros, Spanish Imperial Eagle, Yellow-eared Parrot, Gharial and Green Poison Frog.The scientists describe the extinction crisis as an existential threat to civilisation, along with climate change and pollution, to which it is tied.And they say they have a ""moral imperative"" to draw attention to the loss of biodiversity, which they say is still rather ignored by most people.The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Commenting, Prof Diana Fisher of the University of Queensland, Australia, said the study deserved attention because so many people don't realise how much of the world's wildlife faces impending extinction. ""I agree with the authors that this extinction crisis needs to be elevated to an emergency equal to climate change,"" she said.Prof Chris Johnson of the University of Tasmania said the current rate of extinction of species is higher than at any time since 66 million years ago, when the collision of a space-rock with the Earth killed off dinosaurs and many other species. ""Threats to species in today's world - things like habitat destruction and climate change - are growing rapidly,"" he said, adding that the 515 species down to 1,000 or fewer individuals are likely to be gone very soon.

SpaceX Nasa Mission: Astronauts on historic mission enter space station,"US astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have docked with, and entered, the International Space Station (ISS).Their Dragon capsule - supplied and operated by the private SpaceX company - attached to the bow section of the orbiting lab 422km above China.After a wait for leak, pressure and temperature checks, the pair disembarked to join the Russian and American crew already on the ISS.Hurley and Behnken launched from Florida on Saturday.Theirs is the first crew outing launched from American soil to orbit since the retirement of the US space agency (Nasa) shuttles nine years ago. This is the first time in human history @NASA_Astronauts have entered the @Space_Station from a commercially-made spacecraft. @AstroBehnken and @Astro_Doug have finally arrived to the orbiting laboratory in @SpaceX's Dragon Endeavour spacecraft. pic.twitter.com/3t9Ogtpik4End of Twitter post  by @NASAThe mission marks the beginning of a new era in which Nasa will be purchasing transport services from the commercial sector. No more will it own and operate the American vehicles that run to and from the station.This will be done exclusively by firms such as SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, which is led by tech billionaire Elon Musk.Confirmation of the Dragon's attachment at the ISS came at 14:16 GMT (15:16 BST) on Sunday, 19 hours after leaving the Kennedy Space Center atop a Falcon rocket also provided by SpaceX.The docking was a fully automated process; Hurley and Behnken had no need to get involved - although they had practised some manual flying on approach. The doors between Dragon and the ISS were opened at 17:02 GMT (18:02 BST). When Hurley and Behnken floated through, they were met by ISS Commander and fellow Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.""We're just happy to be here and Chris is going to put us work. And hopefully we will fit in and not mess too many things up,"" said Doug Hurley as he nursed a bruise picked up on his forehead. Bob Behnken said the pair were well rested and ready for the tasks ahead.""We did get probably a good seven hours or so (of sleep),"" he said in a radio link with mission control in Houston, Texas. ""The first night is always a little bit of a challenge, but the Dragon was a slick vehicle, and we had good air flow and so we had an excellent evening. (We're) just excited to be back in low-Earth orbit again.""Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine congratulated the duo on a job well done: ""The whole world saw this mission and we are so, so proud of everything you've done for our country and, in fact, to inspire the world.""SpaceX flew a first demonstration of its new crew vehicle last year, but that had only a dummy aboard. This sortie is the first to carry humans.Hurley's and Behnken's job on the mission is to test all onboard systems and to give their feedback to engineers.SpaceX and Nasa need a clean crewed demonstration so they can move swiftly to the next phase of the company's $2.6bn (£2.1bn) contract, which will encompass six astronaut ""taxi"" flights, with the first of these likely to occur at the end of August. Hurley's and Behnken's arrival at the ISS means they get to claim a Stars and Stripes flag placed on the platform by the members of the very last space shuttle mission in 2011.The Atlantis orbiter's crew left this flag as an incentive to all those that came after them. The flag, which also flew on the very first shuttle flight in 1981, will now be returned to Earth to be given to the mission that next goes beyond Earth orbit.  Earlier, Hurley and Behnken named their Dragon ship in the time-honoured tradition of US spacefarers. They called it ""Endeavour"", in part to celebrate the new course being set by Nasa and its commercial partners, but also to acknowledge the past contribution to American space efforts by Shuttle Endeavour, on which both Hurley and Behnken served in the late 2000s.It's somewhat uncertain how long Hurley and Behnken will stay at the ISS, but perhaps as much as four months.In that time, they will become members of the current ISS Expedition 63 crew, taking part in the platform's everyday science and maintenance activities.Chris Cassidy joked that because his new crewmates arrived on a Sunday, they had missed the cleaning chores that normally take place on a Saturday. ""We'll catch up next weekend,"" the commander said.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",31 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: What is the Crew Dragon?,"The Crew Dragon  launched astronauts from US soil for the first time since the last Shuttle flight in 2011. But it's a very different type of vehicle to Nasa's retired spaceplane.Elon Musk says human spaceflight had always been the fundamental goal for his pioneering company SpaceX.The entrepreneur achieved that ambition on Saturday 30 May 2020, when the Crew Dragon spacecraft carried Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS).But the company had to walk before it could run. Crew Dragon evolved from an earlier design, called Dragon 1, which launched 20 times on missions to deliver cargo to the ISS between May 2012 and March 2020.In May 2014, Musk unveiled the seven-seat Crew Dragon concept during an event at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Like Dragon 1, the crewed version is a capsule design, making it more similar to the Apollo command modules that carried astronauts to the Moon than the winged space shuttle concept, which was conceived to carry both a crew and a large payload.From launch up until shortly before re-entry, the capsule is attached to a section called the trunk which has solar panels, heat-removal radiators and fins to provide stability during emergency aborts. Together, the capsule and trunk stand around 8.1m (26.7ft) tall, with a diameter of 4m (13ft).The Crew Dragon is equipped with 16 Draco thrusters that are used to manoeuvre the vehicle in orbit. Each Draco is capable of producing 90 pounds of force in the vacuum of space.SpaceX engineer John Federspiel, explains: ""When we wanted to take Dragon and make it human-rated, I think we took a different approach to spaceship design than has previously been done, because we wanted this to feel like a 21st Century spaceship.""Probably one of the biggest features of Dragon are the touchscreens on the inside. We designed them not just to be very functional, but with a user experience in mind.""The three large displays that allow Hurley and Behnken to monitor systems and control the spacecraft are a world away from the analogue buttons, dials and control stick that featured in the cockpit of the shuttle, which flew from 1981 to 2011.The two Nasa astronauts have been working with SpaceX to get the vehicle ready for its first crewed flight. Hurley admits that the ""glass cockpit"" took a bit of getting used to. ""As far as actual physical feedback, you certainly don't get that from the touchscreen,"" he says.""But what you do get is an indication of where you touched and that's part of the process of flying the vehicle manually is... I touched that button and that made the vehicle go up and I got the return flash that that's what the vehicle recognised as my input.""For the types of scenarios where astronauts might need to assume manual control of the normally autonomous craft, such as finishing off a docking sequence with the space station, the touchscreen controls are ""much more than adequate"", Hurley adds.""It just might not be the same thing you'd want to use if you were suited up and trying to fly an entry or descent, for example, like we could do with the space shuttle,"" says Behnken.But tailoring the spacecraft to the user experience involved more than just the design of the controls. ""When I think of comfort for the astronauts, it's really every aspect of how you could interact with the spaceship that comes to mind,"" says John Federspiel.""We have three different seat sizes, we even go so far as moulding the foam around the astronaut's body so there's not any pressure points and it's just generally a pleasurable journey into space.""But in case anything goes wrong on the pad or during the climb to orbit, SpaceX has designed an innovative abort system for the capsule. The launch escape system (LES) consists of a set of SpaceX-designed SuperDraco engines that fire in the event of an emergency to propel the capsule and its crew safely away from the rocket.Commenting on the LES, Doug Hurley says: ""That perspective for me is huge compared to shuttle, where there were what we call 'black zones'... scenarios where it didn't really matter if you had the right combination of failures, you were likely not going to survive.""In addition, Hurley comments: ""The capsule design is a safer design than a winged vehicle under most circumstances.""Behnken adds: ""The space shuttle was 10 times larger in terms of mass than you needed to get into low-Earth orbit... flying on a smaller rocket, really focused on the crew mission... provides another level of safety.""John Federspiel explains: ""Dragon is a spaceship that's all about safety and reliability. We designed it to be two-fault tolerant, which means that any two things could fail, so I could lose a flight computer and a thruster and I could still bring the crew home safely.""When it returns to Earth, the Crew Dragon can't simply land on a runway like the space shuttle. ""I think there's an argument that the return is more dangerous in some ways than the ascent,"" says Elon Musk.During re-entry, the heat shield must survive temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sun, as the Crew Dragon screams through the atmosphere at up to 25 times the speed of sound.There's a minor chance that the spacecraft's asymmetric design - driven by the placement of its emergency escape system - could cause it to roll too much. Musk has said in the past that the issue, known as roll instability, has been extensively studied, but that it still worries him.Then, after the fiery re-entry phase, the spacecraft needs to deploy four parachutes to slow its descent. Finally, the Crew Dragon splashes down in the Atlantic Ocean, 450km off the coast of Florida, where recovery ships will take the astronauts to safety and retrieve the capsule. Hurley says that while he and Behnken - along with others at Nasa - provided input, ""this spacecraft - Crew Dragon - is SpaceX's design, from start to finish. Make no mistake about that"".He adds: ""Just to see the vehicle come from not very much, a preliminary design, to where it is today, the operability of the vehicle, the clean lines, how it is inside the vehicle, how it is for a crew... we're just excited to put it through its paces.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",31 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: How we got to this point,"Elon Musk's SpaceX has launched people to the space station. But why is a private company sending astronauts into space for Nasa?To understand the background to this historic launch with the Crew Dragon spacecraft, we need to go back almost 20 years to a tragic accident.On 1 February 2003, the space shuttle Columbia broke apart while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. All seven astronauts aboard perished in the disaster.The loss of Columbia and its crew was the trigger for a dramatic shift in direction for America's human spaceflight programme.On 14 January 2004, President George W Bush announced that the space shuttle would be retired after completion of the International Space Station (ISS). In its place, America would build a new vehicle capable of returning astronauts to the Moon.The following year, then-Nasa chief Mike Griffin announced that the completion of the ISS would, for the first time, open up commercial opportunities for the routine transportation of cargo and astronauts to low-Earth orbit. This, Griffin reasoned, was required to free up enough funds to achieve a Moon return. Nasa established a Commercial Crew & Cargo Program Office (C3PO) to oversee the effort.At the time, SpaceX, the company started by South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk was just a few years old. Musk had lofty ambitions about bringing down the cost of spaceflight by re-using space hardware and settling humans on Mars. He also had many doubters.But SpaceX, along with Virginia-based Orbital Sciences, would eventually win contracts to fulfil the first part of Nasa's commercial vision - ferrying supplies and other cargo to the space station. SpaceX's Dragon cargo spacecraft could not carry humans, but it was a major milestone for the company.In 2008, Barack Obama became president. His administration kicked off a review of the human spaceflight programme, which led to the cancellation of his predecessor's plan to return to the Moon (known as Constellation). However, the Obama administration favoured the continued commercialisation of space, backing the development of private crew vehicles. But it would take time and, after the space shuttle was retired, Nasa had to fill the gap by paying Russia tens of millions of dollars per seat to fly its astronauts to the ISS on the Soyuz vehicle, which launches from Baikonur in Kazakhstan.Congress was initially sceptical about the Commercial Crew Program and did not provide sufficient funds at first. But Charles Bolden, the former astronaut who took over from Griffin as Nasa chief under Obama, persisted and eventually secured the support he needed.From their initial $50m investment in the programme in 2010, the space agency whittled several competing companies down to two - SpaceX and Boeing - in 2014.Since then, they have been refining and testing their spacecraft designs. In March 2019, SpaceX performed a triumphant launch of the Crew Dragon without astronauts. Using automated procedures, the capsule successfully approached and docked with the space station. It was carrying a mannequin called Ripley - after Ellen Ripley, the protagonist in the Alien movies - decked out with sensors to measure the G forces experienced during flight, particularly the launch and return phases. Despite this success, and others along the way, it hasn't always been plain sailing for SpaceX. In 2016, a Falcon 9 rocket blew up on the launch pad. And in April 2019, a Crew Dragon capsule exploded during a so-called static fire test on the ground. No one was hurt in either event. The spacecraft was also having problems with the parachute system designed to bring it back safely to Earth. These mishaps, along with earlier funding shortfalls for the Commercial Crew Program, had introduced delays to an original timeline that would have seen SpaceX launch crew to the ISS in October 2016. Frustrated by the hold ups and the time SpaceX was spending on its Starship project to build a super heavy-lift launch vehicle, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted:Bridenstine sent the tweet the night before a major Starship media event where Musk was due to speak.The next day, Musk shot back with a quip aimed at the agency's own timelines. Asked about the tweet by CNN, Musk answered: ""Did he (Bridenstine) say Commercial Crew or SLS?""The SpaceX founder was referring to Nasa's Space Launch System rocket - designed to launch humans to the Moon - which has also been hit by delays and cost overruns.Musk's company wasn't alone in experiencing challenges, however. A timing anomaly prevented Boeing's spacecraft - the CST-100 Starliner - from docking with the space station during an uncrewed test flight last year.However, a successful in-flight test of the Crew Dragon's launch abort system in January 2020 helped clear the way for the historic flight from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on 30 May.In the post-launch press conference, both Bridenstine and Musk struck more conciliatory tones, in contrast to the tensions over the Starship project.""If you would have told me then (eight months prior, when he sent the tweet) that we would be right here today, I don't know that I would have believed it,"" said Bridenstine.""Since that day, Elon Musk and SpaceX have delivered on everything Nasa has asked them to deliver on - and at a speed that we never would have guessed.""The Nasa chief also congratulated SpaceX on its safety culture. Musk replied: ""Nasa made us way better than we would otherwise have been - and of course, we couldn't even have got started without Nasa.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",27 May 2020,science
Nasa SpaceX launch: Who are the astronauts?,"Two US astronauts have achieved a world first by launching to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a spacecraft built by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Here, BBC News profiles the crew members.Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have broken a nine-year hiatus for Nasa, becoming the first astronauts to launch from US soil since the retirement of the space shuttle in 2011. In the intervening years, Nasa bought seats for its astronauts - at a cost of tens of millions of dollars per flight - on the Russian Soyuz.But officials have also worked with Elon Musk's company SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing to develop new, American spacecraft capable of ferrying humans to and from the ISS - under the space agency's Commercial Crew Program.Musk's vehicle was first to fly; Hurley and Behnken travelled to the ISS in the sleek Crew Dragon spacecraft.""It's well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station and I am certainly honoured to be a part of it,"" Hurley, 53, said at the beginning of May, before the flight.Behnken, 49, added: ""On my first flight... I didn't have a son, so I'm really excited to share the mission with him.""Nasa chose two of its most experienced astronauts to help California-based SpaceX ready the Crew Dragon for launch. The two are also longstanding friends.""Being lucky enough to fly with your best friend... I think there's a lot of people who wish they could do that,"" says Hurley.When they launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket, their spouses knew exactly what they were going through. That's because they're astronauts too.Marine Colonel Hurley's wife Karen Nyberg flew into space twice - aboard the shuttle and the Soyuz - retiring from Nasa this year. They have a 10-year-old son, Jack, whose formative years were shaped by space travel.Nyberg began training for a six-month space station mission just a few months after Jack's birth. In the meantime, Hurley was preparing for his own flight - piloting the last ever shuttle mission. Sometimes, Nyberg took Jack to Russia, at other times he stayed at home in Texas.""Literally from the time Jack was old enough to comprehend things, he was either going to Russia or Skyping with mommy. That's just the way it was,"" Hurley told the Houston Chronicle in 2013.Air Force Colonel Behnken is married to Megan McArthur, who flew on the last mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. As an active member of the astronaut corps, she is a potential candidate to be the first woman on the Moon when Nasa returns in 2024. Their son, Theo, is six.Hurley, Behnken, Nyberg and McArthur all graduated from the same astronaut class (2000) and attended each other's weddings. The men are so used to each other's company, they now have a spooky rapport.They ""can predict - almost by body language - what the person's opinion is or what their next action is going to be,"" Behnken told CNN before the launch. ""We've just been doing this so long that it's kind of like having a second set of hands.""Hurley says of Behnken: ""I know instantaneously when I've not done something correctly - just put it that way. He doesn't have a good poker face."" But Behnken admits Hurley is the more organised of the two.The older of the two men was raised in the hamlet of Apalachin, in upstate New York. ""It was just a great small town existence... we didn't get a stoplight until I was, I think, in college,"" Hurley said in 2009.Behnken hails from  St Ann, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. In 2010, he described it as ""a blue collar kind of a neighbourhood"", adding: ""I guess, in my bag of tricks... I'm more of a working class sort of a person.""He took jobs in construction before deciding that working outdoors in the summer heat wasn't for him. Both men went to college on military scholarships and gained undergraduate degrees in engineering. While Behnken went on to complete a PhD at Caltech - the elite institute featured in the Big Bang Theory television show - Hurley became an officer in the Marines.They both subsequently trained as military test pilots - at different training schools. It's been the archetypal background for Nasa's astronauts since the days of its first intake - the Mercury Seven.""When I showed up [at Nasa] it was like: 'Well, I have a PhD and an MD,' and I'm sitting there going, 'Mmm, wow! Maybe I was a bit of a slacker',"" said Hurley. ""But you know, your professional development as a pilot and the thousands of hours you get as a pilot... brings something to the table.""Hurley and Behnken were selected as astronaut candidates three years before the shuttle Columbia broke up on re-entry, killing seven crew members. After the disaster, Nasa decided it would retire the shuttle, handing over space station transport to private firms.Thus, when the two men were finally assigned their flights, the shuttle programme was in its final phase. Their missions focused on fulfilling Nasa's prior commitments to complete construction of the ISS, including the delivery of crew compartments designed to fit in the shuttle's payload bay.When the spaceplane was retired, the pair were assigned to the Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Hurley and Behnken were announced as the prime crew for Demo-2, the first flight of SpaceX's vehicle with humans onboard.""Bob and I, the last two years, have essentially been living in California, working hand-in-hand with the folks at SpaceX to get us to this point,"" Hurley said this month.They've had to get used to the Crew Dragon's touchscreen controls after previously working with the chunky buttons on shuttle instrument panels.Hurley says a background in evaluating military aircraft as test pilots proved crucial in their work with SpaceX.""That, in and of itself, helped both of us tremendously, because all along the process that you see in the military, there are delays, there are technical challenges, there are things that you don't expect and you have to work through them,"" he explained.Setbacks - including two spectacular explosions that destroyed a rocket and one of the Crew Dragon capsules - have seen the mission slip by nearly four years from its original date of October 2016. ""We were well-prepared for that part of it, when I think it caused some frustration within Nasa as launch dates weren't made,"" explained Hurley.Despite bumps in the road, Behnken's enthusiasm remained undimmed: ""It's probably the dream of every test pilot school student to have the opportunity to fly on a brand new spaceship.""Hurley told CNN: ""From a first flight standpoint, certainly, there might be some greater quantifiable risk to some degree.""But probably no different to any other spaceflight we've flown humans on before.""Follow Paul on Twitter.",31 May 2020,science
Climate change: May was sunniest calendar month on record in UK,"May was the sunniest calendar month on record, and spring was the sunniest spring, the Met Office has said.The UK enjoyed 266 hours of sunshine in May - surpassing the previous record of 265 hours in June 1957.And it is even more extraordinary following a drenching winter, with record rain in February. Meteorologists say they are amazed at the sudden switch from extreme wet to extreme dry – it is not ""British"" weather.On average the UK gets 436 hours of sunshine between March and the end of May.Since 1929, only 10 years have had more than 500 hours. And none has got more than 555 hours. Scientists say the recent weather in the UK has been unprecedented and astounding. This year we've bathed in an extraordinary 626 hours - smashing the previous record by a “staggering” amount, one Met Office worker said.It is because the jet stream has locked the fine weather in place, just as it locked the previous winter rainfall in place. Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, told BBC News: “We’ve swung from a really unsettled spell with weather systems coming in off the Atlantic to a very, very settled spell.“It’s unprecedented to see such a swing from one extreme to the other in such a short space of time. That’s what concerns me. We don’t see these things normally happening with our seasons. “It’s part of a pattern where we’re experiencing increasingly extreme weather as the climate changes.”Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office, said: “If we look at the difference in rainfall that’s fallen over the winter compared to spring it is the largest difference in rainfall amount in our national series from 1862.“The sunshine statistics are really astounding.“The stand out is by how much sunshine has broken the previous record - set in 1948. There’s been more sunshine than most of our past summer seasons. It's quite remarkable."" One of his colleagues described the figures as ""absolutely staggering"".The Met Office says this year is not an indicator of the future, because the jet stream might behave differently.Scientists suspect man-made climate change may be implicated, but it is too soon to tell.  Some of them believe the rapid man-made heating of the Arctic, which has led to record temperatures and wildfires in Siberia, may be influencing the jet stream, although that is not proven.Professor Joe Smith, chief executive of the Royal Geographical Society, told BBC News: ""For many people, the recent long sunny spell is simply 'nice weather'. ""In a wider context it’s a signal of the increasing unpredictability of the UK’s climate. Planning for the growing season is starting to resemble a night at the gambling tables. “The fact remains that bold early actions to slash emissions can still cut the larger risks associated with climate change in the UK and around the world”.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin",1 June 2020,science
Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate,"The discovery of a new breeding pair raises hope for the survival of the world's rarest primate, the Hainan Gibbon.Ravaged by deforestation and poaching, the ape now lives only in a patch of forest on China's Hainan island.In the 1950s, there were an estimated 2,000 left in the world, but numbers fell to fewer than 10 in the 1970s.The latest census shows numbers have tripled to more than 30 gibbons, living in five separate family groups.The fragile recovery follows decades of work by the Hainan Gibbon Conservation Project, run by the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Hong Kong. ""I can't imagine how sad it would be if Hainan rainforest lost this beautiful animal and its wonderful song,"" said Philip Lo, senior conservation officer.Gibbons are known for their ability to swing gracefully through the forest canopy, making loud, haunting calls to mark their territory. Breeding adults sing duets at dawn to enhance bonding.Villagers heard the calls of two gibbons living in a part of the forest away from the main population late last year.A male and a female were later spotted, and heard singing together, showing they had formed a stable bond. The gibbon forms family groups consisting of one male, two females and their young offspring. The discovery of a fifth breeding pair in a separate fragment of forest is seen as highly significant.Philip Lo said the species remained the rarest primate in the world, but there is hope it could overcome the risk of extinction and recover steadily. He described the success as ""a piece of good news that could cheer up other dedicated conservation colleagues"".Conservation efforts have been under way at Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve since 2003, when the first full census found only 13 individuals living in two groups.A comprehensive rescue programme was put in place, including patrols and monitoring, research into the apes' ecology and behaviour, and the planting of thousands of trees to provide food and shelter.Nearly 20 gibbon species exist throughout the world, from northeastern India to Borneo. Most are under threat from the destruction of forests, hunting and illegal trade.Two species of gibbon have recently disappeared in China and all surviving Chinese species, including the Hainan Gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), are classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.Follow Helen on Twitter.",1 June 2020,science
Climate change: How a green new deal really could go global,"Good news is in short supply at the moment, so brace yourself for a rare burst of optimism about climate change. World leaders know their countries face one of the most severe recessions in history thanks to the coronavirus restrictions.That presents a unique challenge, but also a massive opportunity.Politicians know they are going to need to spend huge amounts of money to kick-start economic activity as the threat of coronavirus finally recedes.It is a one-off, never-to-be-repeated chance to transform their economies. So the question is, what will they spend it on?This week the European Union put its cards on the table. On Wednesday it unveiled what it is billing as the biggest ""green"" stimulus package in history. ""This is about all of us and it is way bigger than any one of us,"" announced Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, when she told European Parliament members what was planned.  ""This is Europe's moment,"" she said.As well as being a big step towards federalism, the recovery package puts fighting climate change at the heart of the bloc's recovery from the pandemic. The scale of what is being proposed is mind-boggling. The headline figure is €750bn, but add in spending from future budgets and the total financial firepower the European Commission says it will be wielding is almost €2tn ($2.2tn).There will be tens of billions of euros to make homes more energy efficient, to decarbonise electricity and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles. The idea is to turbo-charge the European effort to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.""If we do not do it we will be taking much more risk,"" Teresa Ribera, the deputy Prime Minister of Spain told me.""The recovery should be green or it will not be a recovery, it will just be a short-cut into the kind of problems we are facing right now.""If you are thinking this is just something that sandal-wearing European liberals might get behind, think again.Donald Trump may be an avowed supporter of fossil fuels, but his Democratic opponent in the November presidential election is not.Joe Biden is reckoned to be planning a similarly huge green stimulus package for the US.The model is the vast investment projects of the New Deal that helped lift America out of the Great Depression in the 1930s.That was the defining policy of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.Biden is reportedly preparing for his own ""FDR-size presidency"", according to New York magazine.""He knows he needs youth enthusiasm, he knows he needs the left, he knows he needs the core democratic base, and he knows climate is probably the best issue to get that,"" explains energy and climate analyst David Roberts of the US website Vox.""Climate polls the best across all those groups, climate even polls pretty well among wavering Trump voters,"" he says.This is not just about rallying voters. There are sound economic reasons why politicians see green technology as a prudent investment.First off, renewables are now often cheaper than fossil fuels in large parts of the world.The technologies are proven and can be built at scale today.And most importantly, their cost follows the logic of all manufacturing - the more you produce, the cheaper it gets.The same logic applies to hydrogen and to electric vehicles. But it does not apply to fossil fuels, whose cost ultimately relies on mining ever more difficult and dwindling resources.And that contains the seductive promise that a huge government push to scale up solar and wind will make them even more affordable compared with coal, oil and gas - not just in the US, but globally.So the argument goes that renewables provide a pathway for clean growth in the future.Develop innovative new electric vehicles, wind turbines, ways of making homes energy-efficient, energy storage technologies or even new ways of configuring electricity grids and you are likely to find ready markets around the world in coming years.Equally importantly, renewable technologies offer something else that will be needed in the years to come: the potential to create huge numbers of new jobs.The Covid-19 crisis has driven joblessness to near Great Depression levels around the world - worse even than in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Around 40 million Americans are unemployed.Worldwide, 1.6 billion people are reckoned to be in immediate danger of losing their livelihoods, according to the International Labour Organisation.That means governments need to find ways to employ lots and lots of people.Renewable technologies offer precisely the kind of ""shovel-ready"", large-scale and labour-intensive infrastructure projects politicians are looking for.There is the obvious stuff - building wind turbines, solar farms and the foundations of a hydrogen economy - but think also about installing networks of charging points for electric vehicles, the need to insulate homes or revamp urban transport systems.Just like the road and dam building of the American New Deal, projects like these could employ tens of thousands of people in high-skilled and - crucially - local jobs.But here's the rub. China currently looks set to take a very different route to recovery.It remains the biggest piece of the climate change puzzle. China produces almost a third of the world's emissions, as much as the US and the EU combined.Last week, the country's top legislative body, the annual National People's Congress, was in full session.The country already has a big expansion of coal-fired electricity generation underway. There was no suggestion this would be reversed.After the financial crisis in 2008, China ramped up coal-fired power stations as a key part of its stimulus package. But there is still a lot to play for this time round, says Li Shuo, an energy expert with Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing.Few details of the Covid recovery plan were announced at the NPC, and he says much will depend on what American voters decide in November.""The US position looms very large in China's political calculus,"" explains Mr Li.He believes President Trump's energy policies are one of the major barriers to China raising its climate ambitions.""I think there is a feeling here in China that it is unfair for Beijing to move forward with its climate agenda at the same time as the US is moving backwards.""That said, the Chinese public certainly seems to support measures to decarbonise the economy.Eighty-seven percent of Chinese people see climate change as serious a threat as Covid-19, according to a poll conducted in 14 countries by Ipsos MORI in April. Even in America, where support was lowest, 59% of people agreed that the risks of climate change matched those of the coronavirus in the long term.Nearly two-thirds of all respondents and 57% of Americans said it was important that government actions aimed at economic recovery prioritised action on climate change.And once big economies like Europe and the US adopt policies like these, there is good reason to think other countries will follow suit.One of the most striking - and controversial - aspects of the European plan is that it will be funded in large part by debt raised by the European Commission itself.That represents a significant deepening or European integration that some member states have already signalled they will resist. Under the proposal the hundreds of billions of euros of debt would be serviced by new EU-wide taxes.One option being discussed is a carbon tax that would include levies on imported goods with a high carbon footprint.Think about what that means.Countries that want to sell into the largest economy in the world would now face penalties unless they make efforts to clean up their energy systems.Now imagine that America embarks on a Green New Deal. It might choose to introduce a similar tariff.But I opened this piece offering optimism, so let me present an alternative path. The countries that decarbonise first could lead by example. Remember, the more renewables you produce, the cheaper they get.As low carbon technologies increasingly undercut the fossil fuel alternatives, you won't need a stick to beat other countries into changing their ways - they will just follow the money.You see where this is headed.? Maybe we are not as far away from widespread coordinated action on climate change as many people fear.As I said at the start, a rare opportunity for optimism amongst the gloom of this present crisis.You can hear a radio programme Justin made with producer Laurence Knight about how plans for gigantic government investments to decarbonise the world economy are gaining traction on the World Service's Business Daily.

World's deepest octopus captured on camera,"The deepest ever sighting of an octopus has been made by cameras on the Indian Ocean floor. The animal was spotted 7,000m down in the Java Trench - almost 2km deeper than the previous reliable recording. Researchers, who report the discovery in the journal Marine Biology, say it's a species of ""Dumbo"" octopus.The name is a nod to the prominent ear-like fins just above these animals' eyes that make them look like the 1940s Disney cartoon character.The scientist behind the identification is Dr Alan Jamieson.He's pioneered the exploration of the deep using what are called ""landers"".These are instrumented frames dropped overboard from research ships. They settle on the seabed and record what passes by.Dr Jamieson's equipment filmed two octopuses - one on a drop to 5,760m and a second to 6,957m. The individual animals were 43cm and 35cm in length.They've been placed in the Grimpoteuthis family - the group commonly known as Dumbo.Octopus fragments and eggs have been found at very great depths, but until this discovery, the previous deepest reliable sighting was at 5,145m down. That was a black and white photo of an animal taken 50 years ago off Barbados. The significance of the Indian Ocean observations is that we now know that octopuses can find potentially suitable habitat across at least 99% of the global seafloor. But those animals that do live at depth will clearly need some special adaptations, says Dr Jamieson. ""They'd have to do something clever inside their cells. If you imagine a cell is like a balloon - it's going to want to collapse under pressure. So, it will need some smart biochemistry to make sure it retains that sphere,"" the scientist explained. ""All the adaptations you need to live at pressure are at the cellular level.""    Dr Jamieson recorded the new octopus while working as chief scientist on the Five Deeps Expedition. This was the project that saw Texan financier Victor Vescovo take a submersible to the deepest sectors of the five major oceans on Earth.While Mr Vescovo was setting human dive records, Dr Jamieson was conducting the tandem science investigations.He hopes his findings can help dispel some of the misunderstandings about the deepest parts of the ocean. ""The laws of marine ecology and marine biology are actually much the same. And we need the Dumbo octopus out there to blur that line between the depths we think we care about and the depths we don't. This idea that only animals in a kind Victorian freak show live at depth isn't right.""Dr Jamieson is currently the CEO of Armatus Oceanic, a deep-sea consultancy.

Demands grow for 'green industrial revolution',"Greenpeace has joined a growing list of organisations demanding that the UK government puts protecting the environment at the heart of any post-Covid-19 economic stimulus package.The campaign group has produced a detailed ""manifesto"" with measures to boost clean transport and smart power.The document follows a comparable call from some of Britain's most powerful business leaders earlier this week. Last week, the prime minister also expressed a similar ambition.Boris Johnson said he wanted to see a ""fairer, greener and more resilient global economy"" after Covid-19 and that ""we owe it to future generations to build back better"". The manifesto also contains measures to support the protection of nature, green buildings and the creation of an economy in which virtually everything is reused.Greenpeace says the crisis has given Britain a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to transform life, travel and work.It added that the plan would create hundreds of thousands of secure jobs.On Monday, more than 200 chief executives of some of the UK's top firms - including HSBC, National Grid, and Heathrow airport - signed a letter to the prime minister asking him to use the Covid-19 lockdown as a springboard to ""deliver a clean, just recovery"".Many people may be surprised how similar the recommendations of these two very different interest groups are. Greenpeace's manifesto is, however, considerably more detailed.It is a 62-page document with specific policy, spending and tax measures covering most of the British economy.It calls on the government to deliver its 2050 net zero emissions goal before 2045.Many voters say they support tackling climate change when polled.However, lots of the policies Greenpeace proposes would prove very controversial. For example, motorists say they are ready to change their behaviour to improve air quality, according to a recent AA survey.  But many drivers may balk at Greenpeace's proposals to radically redesign the road network to favour walking and cycling, at the suggestion that petrol and diesel cars are banned by 2030 or that fuel duty is steadily increased.Many homeowners might be reluctant to spend money to upgrade their properties to meet tough energy efficiency standards.At the same time, many local communities are likely to resist the plan for a big increase in onshore wind and solar power to complement a proposed massive expansion of offshore wind farms - few things unite local communities like a proposal to put in an array of wind turbines.But, says Greenpeace, tough policies like these are essential if the government is going to take meaningful action to tackle climate change.""The choices our government makes now will define… whether or not we succeed in the fight against the climate emergency"", says John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace.""If we fail to get this right, we may never get another chance. Now is the time for a green recovery, and for that we need action not words.""It says there would be huge dividends in terms of job creation, should its programme be adopted.Greenpeace calculates that its plans would create hundreds of thousands of new high-skilled jobs as well as helping to level up inequalities between communities in the UK.The UK government has already indicated that protecting the environment will feature heavily in any stimulus package.Back in April, Boris Johnson said a post-Covid-19 recovery plans should include efforts to ""turn the tide on climate change"".Meanwhile, the European Union has unveiled what it called the biggest ""green"" stimulus in history.Last week, it said it planned to commit a whopping €750bn (£667bn; $841bn) to its recovery package.Add in spending from future budgets and the total financial firepower the European Commission says it will be wielding is almost €2tn (£1.8tn; $2.2tn).Fighting climate change is at the heart of the bloc's recovery from the pandemic. There will be tens of billions of euros to make homes more energy efficient, to de-carbonise electricity and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.The idea is to turbo-charge the European effort to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.""If we do not do it, we will be taking much more risk,"" Teresa Ribera, deputy prime minister of Spain, told the BBC.""The recovery should be green or it will not be a recovery, it will just be a shortcut into the kind of problems we are facing right now.""Follow Justin on Twitter.",4 June 2020,science
