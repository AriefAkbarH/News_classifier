Meet the baby orangutans learning to climb trees,"While much of the world is in lockdown, youngsters in one very unusual classroom are still having lessons.At a forest school in Borneo, baby orangutans learn tree-climbing skills from their human surrogate parents.The orphans spend 12 hours a day in the forest, preparing for a new life in the wild.The orangutans were filmed and photographed before coronavirus struck, for the TV series Primates, on BBC One.With human contact routinely kept to a minimum, life goes on much as before for the animals, says Dr Signe Preuschoft, leader of ape programmes for the charity Four Paws, which runs the rehabilitation centre in East Kalimantan.As a precaution, the staff now have temperature checks, wear facemasks and change into uniforms on site.The pandemic has disrupted many conservation programmes around the world but Dr Preuschoft says it also offers an opportunity to bring positive change.""There are great opportunities here to protect wildlife better from illegal wildlife trade and from (consumption of) bushmeat,"" she says. ""It's very much about education.""The young orphaned apes climb high into the treetops with their caregivers to help them acquire the skills they would have learned from their mothers in the wild.They would otherwise spend more time on the ground than is natural for a species that feeds, lives and sleeps in the canopies of trees.Baby orangutans have a huge advantage when it comes to climbing, as they can hold on ""like an octopus"", says Dr Preuschoft.""I think the orangutans were really completely thrilled when they realised that they could actually be in a canopy together with one of their moms,"" she adds.

How coronavirus is driving a revolution in travel,"Barriers closed a stretch of Deansgate, Manchester's main thoroughfare, to motor vehicles on Saturday.Elsewhere in the city, new pedestrian walkways and pop-up bike lanes have appeared. It is part of a nationwide effort to create more space for social distancing as the country gradually begins to lift the coronavirus restrictions.Glasgow, Leicester, York and Brighton have also created new space for walking or cycling this week.And dozens more UK towns and cities plan to do so.On Friday, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he would be shutting some of the busiest roads in the city.He said his plan to close large swathes of London to cars and vans would create one of the largest car-free areas of any city in the world.""Many Londoners have rediscovered the joys of walking and cycling during lockdown"", Mr Khan said.  ""By quickly and cheaply widening pavements, creating temporary cycle lanes and closing roads to through traffic we will enable millions more people to change the way they get around our city.""He acknowledged that the changes would cause disruption for many Londoners but said he had no choice but to rapidly repurpose London's streets for people.""By ensuring our city's recovery is green, we will also tackle our toxic air, which is vital to make sure we don't replace one public health crisis with another.""Most of the changes being brought in around the country are a temporary response to the coronavirus crisis, but many local authorities say that - following consultation with local communities - they would like to make them permanent. ""We hope that pedestrians and cyclists will reclaim the streets of this city"", councillor Angeliki Stogia, Manchester's lead member for Transport and Environment, told the BBC.  The coronavirus crisis has allowed many projects to be fast-tracked.""Some of the projects Manchester is introducing have been in the planning process for years,"" she said.The government has acknowledged that resolving how we can travel while maintaining social distancing is one of the biggest challenges it faces as it starts to lift the lockdown.The current message is: don't use public transport if you can avoid it, yet if people take to their cars, our streets will be choked with traffic.Last week, the government announced what it called a ""once in a generation"" investment to change the way Britain gets around.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps ordered English local authorities to make ""significant changes"" to give more space to pedestrians and cyclists.He said he would be setting up a £250 million emergency fund to encourage what he called ""active travel"".Mr Shapps said the money was the first instalment of a £2bn package for cycling and walking, part of a £5bn investment announced in February.Councils can already use temporary traffic orders to widen pavements, install cycle lanes, create new zebra crossings and close entire streets to traffic, and Mr Shapps has said he will enhance their powers.It means local authorities have the ability to completely alter the way traffic moves through a town or city.But most of the new measures involve restricting car and other motor vehicle access.Some motorists see what is happening as a land grab, conducted under the cover of covid and designed to create ""new facts on the ground"".""What is worrying about this is that it feels anti-motorist, anti-cars, anti-lorries, anti-vans"", says Rod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association.  ""All those methods of transport are essential for economic recovery, so don't punish one group at the expense of the other"", he urges.Manchester has dubbed its campaign to encourage walking and cycling ""Safe Streets Save Lives"".The city says it will use £5m of emergency funding to introduce changes where they are most needed, so outside shops, transport hubs or on routes to hospitals.The aim is that these initiatives will help achieve the authority's goal of making the city carbon-neutral by 2038 as well as creating a healthier, more pleasant city.The focus is not just on the city centre.Levenshulme in south-east Manchester will see some of the most dramatic traffic calming measures in the entire region.The plan is that 30 traffic filters made of heavy concrete flower pots and bollards will close much of the neighbourhood to through traffic over the next few weeks.""We have consulted with the community and they say want to make this area a nicer place to live"", says Levenshulme resident Pauline Johnson. She said the response from local people has been overwhelmingly positive.""They say they want this to be somewhere where children can play safely in the streets.""Greater Manchester's cycling commissioner Chris Boardman, says cycling has increased by more than 70% on some days since the lockdown in the region.""What coronavirus has shown is that if you give people safe, traffic free streets they will walk more and ride bikes"", he told the BBC.""If we don't take steps to enable people to keep traveling actively, we risk a huge spike in car use as measures are eased"", the Olympic gold winner said.""Not only is it the right thing to do to protect people now, but it's vital to meet our clean air goals and protect our NHS long-term.""Lockdown has certainly prompted a boom in bike sales.

'Golden tongue' helps ensure maple syrup quality,"Scientists have developed a ""golden tongue"" to help producers test the quality of maple syrup.A team of researchers from Canada used the precious metal to develop a way of checking whether samples were ""off flavour"".The test used nanoparticles of gold, which normally looked red but appeared blue when the sample of syrup was deemed to be below a premium grade.The details have been published in the Analytical Methods journal.Maple syrup is synonymous with the north-eastern reaches of North America. Its production is one of the oldest agriculture enterprises in the US and Canada, with a history stretching back hundreds of years. Native Americans first discovered the elixir made from the sap of sugar maples, before passing on the technique to settlers. Today, the global market for maple syrup is estimated to be in excess of US$1.2bn (£970m).Once the first signs of spring are on the temporal horizon and the sap in the sugar maples (Acer saccharum) begins to rise, farmers set up a network of taps in the trunk of the trees to draw off the sweet produce.On average, the maple syrup season lasts for four to six weeks, with the sweetness and robustness of flavour changing over that period.In order to produce the maple syrup that we pour over pancakes or use in cooking, the sap flows from the trees to sugar shacks or sugar huts, where the fluid is boiled and much of its water content is evaporated. From an initial mixture of 98% water and 2% sugar, the finished syrup consists of 33% water and 67% sugar. On average, 40 litres of sap is needed to produce one litre of syrup.Just as the characteristic of wine is determined by the ""terroir"", in other words the unique aspects of the vineyard, such as temperature, soil, slope of the land, rainfall; the same is true with maple syrup. Each farm's produce has its own signature flavour.However, the US and Canada have a grading system to help consumers distinguish between different varieties produced during the sap season, based on strength of flavour.Early season syrup is lighter in colour and has a more delicate flavour compared with the darker, more robust flavoured syrups that come towards the end of the short production season.In order to help grade their products, producers approached a team at the University of Montreal.""The Quebec Maple Syrup Producers approached us in 2017 to help them develop a test that could identify maple syrups presenting a different flavour profile, occurring mainly late in the harvest,"" co-author Jean-Francois Masson, a professor of chemistry at the university, explained.Prof Masson's team specialises in the use of gold nanomaterials and realised it could use the nanoparticles (about 100th the width of a human hair) of the precious metal to produce a colour test for the Quebec producers, who are responsible for about 70% of the world's supply of maple syrup.""Gold no longer appears a shiny yellow colour (at this scale) but a deep red colour. The presence of molecules associated with the different flavour profile causes the gold nanoparticles to clump, which is associated with a colour change to a deep blue,"" he told BBC News.""As such, the test works very similarly to a pH or chlorine test for swimming pools.""Prof Masson explained the team used gold because only a very small amount was needed to run a test (about one millionth of a gram). Also, the material's colour change was easily detected by a ""simple spectrophotometer"", and gold reacted well to certain molecules in maple syrup.He hopes the test will be beneficial to producers in a variety of ways.""The producers currently request a tool to help them manage the harvest year and to decide on which days they should produce maple syrup leading to premium quality,"" he said.""The industry may benefit from the tool, as it can help identify 'off-flavour' maple syrups and this (can) assist trained technicians [to assess] the proper grade of the 300,000 barrels produced each year in Quebec.""Off-flavour refers to produce that does not have the expected taste of a premium grade syrup. However, these syrups are still edible and are often used in industrial processes as an added ingredient rather than being sold as a premium grade product.",16 May 2020,science
'Surge' in illegal bird of prey killings since lockdown,"The wildlife charity the RSPB says it has been ""overrun"" by reports of birds of prey being illegally killed since the lockdown started six weeks ago.Species of raptors (birds of prey) that had been targeted include hen harriers, peregrine falcons, red kites, goshawks, buzzards and a barn owl.The wildlife charity described the crimes as ""orchestrated"".It said the ""vast majority"" had connections with shooting estates, or land managed for shooting.Some raptors are known to feed on pheasant and grouse chicks.The head of the RSPB's investigations unit, Mark Thomas, told the BBC it was like ""the Wild West"" out in the countryside. He said people who wanted to kill birds of prey had been ""emboldened"" by the absence of walkers and hikers. He said the surge correlated exactly with the date the lockdown was imposed.At this time of year he said that the RSPB would normally be getting three or four reports of the killing of protected bird species each week. They now have three or four reports of a killing each day, and they are coming from across the country. The wildlife charity alleges that the incidents are overwhelmingly connected with land managed for sport shoots. Raptors prey on bird species that have been specifically reared for be killed for sport, like grouse or pheasant.Mr Thomas said, ""I am genuinely disturbed. in more than 20 years of investigating, I've never seen anything like it. We are having to put ongoing investigations on hold in order to triage all these reports... This isn't youngsters with air rifles but orchestrated wildlife crime.""According to the RSPB, on 29 March a buzzard was found shot at Shipton, near York. Its wing was fractured in two places and an X-ray revealed several pieces of shot within the bird's body. The buzzard recovered and was released.Over the Easter Weekend, a red kite was found shot dead near Leeds. It had 12 shotgun pellets lodged in its body.  The following weekend, a dead red kite was found in Powys, which had been shot. There were also reports of another two shot red kites in the region. In another case, in South West England, ten buzzards were found, all thought to have been poisoned.The Investigation Unit suspects that the true number of incidents could be much higher, as there are fewer people out in the countryside who might report cases, with walkers and specialist raptor groups under lockdown. All birds of prey are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981).The Moorland Association (MA), whose members include many shooting estates in England and Wales, said it condemned illegal activity. The MA's Director, Amanda Anderson, said: ""Any confirmed reports of raptor persecution are cause for concern. The incidents specified near Leeds and York in the RSPB release are clearly not on grouse moors, while reports we have from our members in the uplands have suggested that many birds of prey are in fact benefiting from the lock-down restrictions and the subsequent reduction in disturbance from members of the public. ""Estates across the country have reported a number of raptors including peregrine, merlin and hen harriers nesting and living on those landscapes.""We condemn any illegal activity and Moorland Association members have signed up to a cross-sector zero tolerance approach to wildlife crime. Estates and gamekeepers have been the eyes and ears on the ground during lockdown, reporting suspicious activity. They are also actively working with police authorities in Operation Owl - an initiative to raise awareness of raptor persecution.  We always encourage reporting of any suspicious incident.""",15 May 2020,science

""All those methods of transport are essential for economic recovery, so don't punish one group at the expense of the other"", he urges.Manchester has dubbed its campaign to encourage walking and cycling ""Safe Streets Save Lives"".The city says it will use £5m of emergency funding to introduce changes where they are most needed, so outside shops, transport hubs or on routes to hospitals.The aim is that these initiatives will help achieve the authority's goal of making the city carbon-neutral by 2038 as well as creating a healthier, more pleasant city.The focus is not just on the city centre.Levenshulme in south-east Manchester will see some of the most dramatic traffic calming measures in the entire region.The plan is that 30 traffic filters made of heavy concrete flower pots and bollards will close much of the neighbourhood to through traffic over the next few weeks.""We have consulted with the community and they say want to make this area a nicer place to live"", says Levenshulme resident Pauline Johnson. She said the response from local people has been overwhelmingly positive.""They say they want this to be somewhere where children can play safely in the streets.""Greater Manchester's cycling commissioner Chris Boardman, says cycling has increased by more than 70% on some days since the lockdown in the region.""What coronavirus has shown is that if you give people safe, traffic free streets they will walk more and ride bikes"", he told the BBC.""If we don't take steps to enable people to keep traveling actively, we risk a huge spike in car use as measures are eased"", the Olympic gold winner said.""Not only is it the right thing to do to protect people now, but it's vital to meet our clean air goals and protect our NHS long-term.""Lockdown has certainly prompted a boom in bike sales.

'Golden tongue' helps ensure maple syrup quality,"Scientists have developed a ""golden tongue"" to help producers test the quality of maple syrup.A team of researchers from Canada used the precious metal to develop a way of checking whether samples were ""off flavour"".The test used nanoparticles of gold, which normally looked red but appeared blue when the sample of syrup was deemed to be below a premium grade.The details have been published in the Analytical Methods journal.Maple syrup is synonymous with the north-eastern reaches of North America. Its production is one of the oldest agriculture enterprises in the US and Canada, with a history stretching back hundreds of years. Native Americans first discovered the elixir made from the sap of sugar maples, before passing on the technique to settlers. Today, the global market for maple syrup is estimated to be in excess of US$1.2bn (£970m).Once the first signs of spring are on the temporal horizon and the sap in the sugar maples (Acer saccharum) begins to rise, farmers set up a network of taps in the trunk of the trees to draw off the sweet produce.On average, the maple syrup season lasts for four to six weeks, with the sweetness and robustness of flavour changing over that period.In order to produce the maple syrup that we pour over pancakes or use in cooking, the sap flows from the trees to sugar shacks or sugar huts, where the fluid is boiled and much of its water content is evaporated. From an initial mixture of 98% water and 2% sugar, the finished syrup consists of 33% water and 67% sugar. On average, 40 litres of sap is needed to produce one litre of syrup.Just as the characteristic of wine is determined by the ""terroir"", in other words the unique aspects of the vineyard, such as temperature, soil, slope of the land, rainfall; the same is true with maple syrup. Each farm's produce has its own signature flavour.However, the US and Canada have a grading system to help consumers distinguish between different varieties produced during the sap season, based on strength of flavour.Early season syrup is lighter in colour and has a more delicate flavour compared with the darker, more robust flavoured syrups that come towards the end of the short production season.In order to help grade their products, producers approached a team at the University of Montreal.""The Quebec Maple Syrup Producers approached us in 2017 to help them develop a test that could identify maple syrups presenting a different flavour profile, occurring mainly late in the harvest,"" co-author Jean-Francois Masson, a professor of chemistry at the university, explained.Prof Masson's team specialises in the use of gold nanomaterials and realised it could use the nanoparticles (about 100th the width of a human hair) of the precious metal to produce a colour test for the Quebec producers, who are responsible for about 70% of the world's supply of maple syrup.""Gold no longer appears a shiny yellow colour (at this scale) but a deep red colour. The presence of molecules associated with the different flavour profile causes the gold nanoparticles to clump, which is associated with a colour change to a deep blue,"" he told BBC News.""As such, the test works very similarly to a pH or chlorine test for swimming pools.""Prof Masson explained the team used gold because only a very small amount was needed to run a test (about one millionth of a gram). Also, the material's colour change was easily detected by a ""simple spectrophotometer"", and gold reacted well to certain molecules in maple syrup.He hopes the test will be beneficial to producers in a variety of ways.""The producers currently request a tool to help them manage the harvest year and to decide on which days they should produce maple syrup leading to premium quality,"" he said.""The industry may benefit from the tool, as it can help identify 'off-flavour' maple syrups and this (can) assist trained technicians [to assess] the proper grade of the 300,000 barrels produced each year in Quebec.""Off-flavour refers to produce that does not have the expected taste of a premium grade syrup. However, these syrups are still edible and are often used in industrial processes as an added ingredient rather than being sold as a premium grade product.",16 May 2020,science
'Surge' in illegal bird of prey killings since lockdown,"The wildlife charity the RSPB says it has been ""overrun"" by reports of birds of prey being illegally killed since the lockdown started six weeks ago.Species of raptors (birds of prey) that had been targeted include hen harriers, peregrine falcons, red kites, goshawks, buzzards and a barn owl.The wildlife charity described the crimes as ""orchestrated"".It said the ""vast majority"" had connections with shooting estates, or land managed for shooting.Some raptors are known to feed on pheasant and grouse chicks.The head of the RSPB's investigations unit, Mark Thomas, told the BBC it was like ""the Wild West"" out in the countryside. He said people who wanted to kill birds of prey had been ""emboldened"" by the absence of walkers and hikers. He said the surge correlated exactly with the date the lockdown was imposed.At this time of year he said that the RSPB would normally be getting three or four reports of the killing of protected bird species each week. They now have three or four reports of a killing each day, and they are coming from across the country. The wildlife charity alleges that the incidents are overwhelmingly connected with land managed for sport shoots. Raptors prey on bird species that have been specifically reared for be killed for sport, like grouse or pheasant.Mr Thomas said, ""I am genuinely disturbed. in more than 20 years of investigating, I've never seen anything like it. We are having to put ongoing investigations on hold in order to triage all these reports... This isn't youngsters with air rifles but orchestrated wildlife crime.""According to the RSPB, on 29 March a buzzard was found shot at Shipton, near York. Its wing was fractured in two places and an X-ray revealed several pieces of shot within the bird's body. The buzzard recovered and was released.Over the Easter Weekend, a red kite was found shot dead near Leeds. It had 12 shotgun pellets lodged in its body.  The following weekend, a dead red kite was found in Powys, which had been shot. There were also reports of another two shot red kites in the region. In another case, in South West England, ten buzzards were found, all thought to have been poisoned.The Investigation Unit suspects that the true number of incidents could be much higher, as there are fewer people out in the countryside who might report cases, with walkers and specialist raptor groups under lockdown. All birds of prey are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981).The Moorland Association (MA), whose members include many shooting estates in England and Wales, said it condemned illegal activity. The MA's Director, Amanda Anderson, said: ""Any confirmed reports of raptor persecution are cause for concern. The incidents specified near Leeds and York in the RSPB release are clearly not on grouse moors, while reports we have from our members in the uplands have suggested that many birds of prey are in fact benefiting from the lock-down restrictions and the subsequent reduction in disturbance from members of the public. ""Estates across the country have reported a number of raptors including peregrine, merlin and hen harriers nesting and living on those landscapes.""We condemn any illegal activity and Moorland Association members have signed up to a cross-sector zero tolerance approach to wildlife crime. Estates and gamekeepers have been the eyes and ears on the ground during lockdown, reporting suspicious activity. They are also actively working with police authorities in Operation Owl - an initiative to raise awareness of raptor persecution.  We always encourage reporting of any suspicious incident.""",15 May 2020,science
Climate change: Could the coronavirus crisis spur a green recovery?,"The Covid-19 lockdown has cut climate change emissions - for now. But some governments want to go further by harnessing their economic recovery plans to boost low-carbon industries. Their slogan is ""Build Back Better"", but can they succeed? I've just had a light bulb moment. The feisty little wren chirping loudly in the matted ivy outside my back door is telling us something important about global climate change.That's because, intertwined with the melodious notes of a robin, I can actually hear its song clearly.Normally, both birds are muffled by the insistent rumble of traffic, but the din has been all but extinguished in the peace of lockdown.The drop in traffic is a major contributor to the fall in planet-warming CO2 emissions we've witnessed globally.Before the Covid-19 crisis, we accepted the dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living. Now, we have sampled an alternative urban ambience. Governments currently face a stark choice: bail out polluting businesses, using that as leverage to impose environmentally-minded reforms, or let them return to their carbon-intensive activities as an economic quick fix.But many members of the public have little desire to return to the state of affairs before lockdown.In a poll, a fifth of members of the motoring group the AA, said they would work more from home in future. This has implications for the UK government's £28bn road-building programme which assumes that traffic will rise by 1% per year - a conjecture that now looks unlikely.The stay-at-home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous public transport users shunning trains for fear of infection, and by long-distance commuters who might decide that if they only need to visit the office three days a week, they'll buy a home even further away.The AA, which for years was seen as the voice of motorists, has asked the government to think again about its £28bn road expansion. Its president, Edmund King, has suggested the money would be better spent on improving broadbandAnother likely winner from the crisis is the movement fighting to turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists. This has already happened in places like Paris, which is rolling out 650km of ""corona cycle-ways"", and Milan, which has a programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists.The determination to seize the moment for environmental change stretches further than the transport sector.The UK is one of several nations looking to reboot its environmental strategy by calling in favours from private industry. After all, it was government which bailed out employers when the crunch came in March. The catchphrase is ""Build Back Better"".But it would seem to face a direct challenge in the shape of China and the US. The economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by the effects of coronavirus. They are desperate to get back to pre-virus levels of output, so their leaders may think the surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted climate warming fossil fuels.For those seeking a greener way out of the Covid-19 slump, renewable energy will help, along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband.Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, is on the same track. He is leading work on a Green Deal to make the EU's economy sustainable and says that not a single Euro should be spent propping up old, dirty industries. All Covid-19 recovery investment should go towards commerce that either helps reduce carbon emissions or promotes digital business, he insists.But some MEPs from parties on the right warn that the pandemic will have ""far-reaching"" economic and social consequences.They insist the EU must scale back its pre-crisis climate ambitions. That's led some governments, like Germany and the UK, to offer hand-outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions.In the UK, the issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving the planet.MPs from the Liberal Democrats - thought of as one of the ""greenest"" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for the airline industry. They say that if ministers don't step in, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost.But the firms should promise to off-set their emissions by, for example, planting trees.Off-setting is hugely contentious. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, argues: ""Any government bailout should focus on workers, not the industry itself.""It should be conditional on the industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low-carbon technology is available - which isn't now.""That begs a question: which industries should qualify for support? Should cash go exclusively to self-evidently green sectors like solar power - or to dirty firms trying to clean up?Take the fossil fuel firms that pay our pension dividends by drilling for the stuff that's over-heating the world.The UK's oil and gas industry warns that 30,000 jobs could be lost because of the pandemic and the current low oil price. But why would governments support a commodity that's fuelling the climate crisis, which is judged by the UN to be deeper than the Covid-19 crisis?Perhaps it's not that simple. Lord Stern, the former Treasury chief who's now a climate expert, told me each firm should be judged on its trajectory, not on its current state.""The oil and gas industries are producing stuff you want to run down very quickly,"" he said. ""But you do see some companies - like BP and Shell - which are declaring they are moving in a direction where they want to be going zero carbon. ""So, you can't be indiscriminate or dogmatic. You have to look where the industry is going.""At least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms that agree on the need to tackle climate change. In the US, some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue government bail-outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future.The Democratic Party has a long-standing proposal for a ""Green New Deal"" to promote clean technology. But President Donald Trump has minimised the importance of climate change. He has promised to help struggling fossil fuel firms, although his efforts have not taken root in a major way.He tweeted:  Then there's China. In 2015, its leaders were persuaded by President Barack Obama to make major climate change commitments as part of the Paris climate agreement. Since then, China has suffered job losses and fuel shortages. Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for the economy by building coal-fired power plants.The green think tank Global Energy Monitor says the number of plants China approved in the first three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts (MW) - was more than the number agreed in the whole of 2019 (6,310 MW).That doesn't take into account China's estimated $1 trillion investment in its ""Belt and Road"" initiative to build huge, carbon-intensive infrastructure projects across developing countries.Unless China and President Trump change their spots (or the Democratic candidate wins the US election), Europe's Build Back Better campaign won't be enough to protect the increasingly fragile climate, even if it does engineer a green recovery.And we have a lesson from history. Nick Robins from the London School of Economics (LSE) estimates that in the global financial crisis of 2008 just 16% of global stimulus plans were green - mainly because China invested massively in fossil fuel projects.He tells me: ""If we have any hope of combating climate change, we must make absolutely sure we do it better this time.""Follow Roger on Twitter.What questions do you have about the environment and Covid-19?In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Coronavirus puts spotlight on landmark year for nature,"The pandemic has disrupted conservation work and funding, with potential repercussions for years to come, according to conservation groups.But we can seize the opportunity to push for stronger action to protect the natural world, say Dr Diogo Veríssimo and Dr Nisha Owen from campaign group On The Edge Conservation.The pandemic struck in what was meant to be a landmark year for biodiversity.New goals for protecting the natural world are due to be agreed in October.While lockdown has been linked to a number of positive environmental changes, including wildlife reclaiming urban spaces, we know very little about how large areas of the world that host vast quantities of biodiversity have been faring, said Dr Owen.""There's reports coming in of illegal activities happening on the ground that are not being patrolled for or monitored or counted because of the effects of coronavirus lockdown or reduced staff or reduced funds,"" she said. ""We're not going to know the scale of what that impact may have been on wildlife and biodiversity until we're able to systematically assess that, and that's probably not going to be until we come out of lockdown."" Loss of funding for conservation work is a growing concern, particularly for lesser-known endangered species, such as pangolins, which already receive a ""smaller slice of the cake"".""It is not just the case that organisations in far flung places are feeling difficulties,"" said Dr Veríssimo, who is also a scientist at the University of Oxford. ""It is also right here in the UK where environmental charities are being gravely affected by all the changes that Covid-19 is producing."" The Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of more than 50 environment and wildlife groups in England, recently warned in a report that UK environment charities are facing a dramatic loss of income, which will have an impact on their ability to care for our land, protect wildlife and tackle climate change and nature's decline for years to come.It comes in what was set to be a ""Super Year for Biodiversity"", as coined by the UN, culminating in a global biodiversity conference in October, where new goals for tackling biodiversity over the next decade were due to be drawn up.Though the timetable has changed, this is a key opportunity for world leaders to set strong goals and highlight that biodiversity is integral to human health and well-being, and the planet that we live on, said Dr Owen.Dr Veríssimo added: ""This pandemic had its biological source in a wild animal. It's about our relationship with nature, and how we have now put animals in contexts and situations where these types of diseases are more likely to not only cross species within wildlife but also cross to humans.""Follow Helen on Twitter.",14 May 2020,science
Nature crisis: Moths have 'secret role' as crucial pollinators,"Long seen as annoying creatures that can leave holes in your clothes, moths have been badly misjudged, say scientists.New research suggests they play a vital role as overnight pollinators of a wide range of flowers and plants. The study says that the moths' transport networks are larger and more complex than those of daytime pollinators like bees.The authors believe there is an urgent need to stem declines in moth numbers. Over the past decade, public anxiety about the role of our pollinators has focused squarely on bees. The fall-off in their numbers, linked to changes in land and widespread use of pesticides, has helped raise environmental awareness of the critical role these creatures play in the food chain. Moths, though, have not evoked similar sympathies. ""There's this big misconception that all moths come and eat my clothes. That's not what happens at all,"" said Dr Richard Walton, from University College London (UCL), the lead author of the new study.""Some of them happen to be visiting flowers and can be an important part of the pollination process.""To find out how vital a part the moths play, Dr Walton and colleagues monitored moth activity around ponds in agricultural areas of Norfolk. They found that 45% of the moths they tested were transporting pollen, which originated from 47 different plant species, including several that were rarely visited by bees, hoverflies and butterflies. The scientists found that while bumblebees and honeybees are critically important, they tended to target the most prolific nectar and pollen sources. Not so with moths.""From what we see from our work, moths tend to be generalists, meaning they're not specifically visiting a narrow group of flowers,"" said Dr Walton.""They're kind of visiting any type of flower that they can access. These tend to be the open cup-shaped flowers like bramble, they can access things from the legume family, the clover family was also very important.""Previous studies on moths have tended to focus on their ability to transport pollen via their proboscis or nose. This new work looked at the pollen collected on the moths' distinctly hairy bodies when they sit on flowers while feeding. The researchers believe their study shows that moths complement the work of daytime pollinators and help keep plant populations diverse and abundant. They serve as a form of back-up for biodiversity, which in turn supports crop yields.The vital role played by the moths has come under increasing threat as they have suffered steep declines in numbers since the 1970s. This is largely due to changes in land use and the increasing use of pesticides. ""This has a knock-on effect for birds that feed on moths, such as the cuckoo. Its decline is kind of tied to moth declines,"" said Dr Walton.""Bats will feed on moths as well, so there's ties to other creatures having declines in their own populations, because their food supply, the moths, are going down as well. You can see this kind of linkage play out.""Helping the moths will require the use of less pesticide and encouraging a wider diversity of plants in the landscape. But perhaps more importantly, the public perception of moths needs to change. ""Something that's out of sight, is often out of mind,"" said Dr Walton.""We just see bees in the daytime and we see them visiting the flower so they've got the better shift when when it comes to work, in terms of being visible.""""But moths are by no means less important. I think it's vital to raise the profile of moths to help the public at large see the important part they play in our ecology.""The study has been published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters.

Scientists explain magnetic pole's wanderings,"European scientists think they can now describe with confidence what's driving the drift of the North Magnetic Pole. It's shifted in recent years away from Canada towards Siberia.And this rapid movement has required more frequent updates to navigation systems, including those that operate the mapping functions in smartphones.A team, led from Leeds University, says the behaviour is explained by the competition of two magnetic ""blobs"" on the edge of the Earth's outer core.Changes in the flow of molten material in the planet's interior have altered the strength of the above regions of negative magnetic flux. ""This change in the pattern of flow has weakened the patch under Canada and ever so slightly increased the strength of the patch under Siberia,"" explained Dr Phil Livermore.""This is why the North Pole has left its historic position over the Canadian Arctic and crossed over the International Date Line. Northern Russia is winning the 'tug of war', if you like,"" he told BBC News. Earth has three poles at the top of the planet. A geographic pole which is where the planet's rotation axis intersects the surface. The geomagnetic pole is the location which best fits a classic dipole (its position alters little). And then there is the North Magnetic, or dip, Pole, which is where field lines are perpendicular to the surface.It is this third pole that has been doing all the movement. When first identified by explorer James Clark Ross in the 1830s, it was in Canada's Nunavut territory.Back then it didn't wander very far, very fast. But in the 1990s, it took off, racing to ever higher latitudes and crossing the date line in late 2017. In the process, it came to within just a few hundred kilometres of the geographic pole.Using data from satellites that have measured the evolving shape of Earth's magnetic field over the past 20 years, Dr Livermore and colleagues have attempted to model the North Magnetic Pole's wanderings.Two years ago when they first presented their ideas at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Washington DC, they suggested there might be a connection with a westward-accelerating jet of molten material in the outer core. But the models were a complex fit and the team has now revised its assessment to align with a different flow regime.""The jet is tied to quite high northern latitudes and the alteration in the flow in the outer core that's responsible for the change in the position of the pole is actually further south,"" Dr Livermore said. ""There's also a timing issue. The jet acceleration occurs in the 2000s, whereas the pole acceleration begins in the 1990s.""The team's latest modelling indicates the pole will continue to move towards Russia but will in time begin to slow. At top speed, it's been making 50-60km a year.""Whether or not it will move back again in the future is anyone's guess,"" the Leeds scientist told BBC News.The pole's recent race across the top of the world prompted the US National Geophysical Data Center and the British Geological Survey to issue an early update to the World Magnetic Model last year. This model is a representation of Earth's magnetic field across the entire globe. It is incorporated into all navigation devices, including modern smartphones, to correct for any local compass errors.Dr Livermore and colleagues leaned heavily on the data acquired by the European Space Agency's Swarm satellites. The team has published its research in the journal Nature Geoscience.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos",6 May 2020,science
Meet the baby orangutans learning to climb trees,"While much of the world is in lockdown, youngsters in one very unusual classroom are still having lessons.At a forest school in Borneo, baby orangutans learn tree-climbing skills from their human surrogate parents.The orphans spend 12 hours a day in the forest, preparing for a new life in the wild.The orangutans were filmed and photographed before coronavirus struck, for the TV series Primates, on BBC One.With human contact routinely kept to a minimum, life goes on much as before for the animals, says Dr Signe Preuschoft, leader of ape programmes for the charity Four Paws, which runs the rehabilitation centre in East Kalimantan.As a precaution, the staff now have temperature checks, wear facemasks and change into uniforms on site.The pandemic has disrupted many conservation programmes around the world but Dr Preuschoft says it also offers an opportunity to bring positive change.""There are great opportunities here to protect wildlife better from illegal wildlife trade and from (consumption of) bushmeat,"" she says. ""It's very much about education.""The young orphaned apes climb high into the treetops with their caregivers to help them acquire the skills they would have learned from their mothers in the wild.They would otherwise spend more time on the ground than is natural for a species that feeds, lives and sleeps in the canopies of trees.Baby orangutans have a huge advantage when it comes to climbing, as they can hold on ""like an octopus"", says Dr Preuschoft.""I think the orangutans were really completely thrilled when they realised that they could actually be in a canopy together with one of their moms,"" she adds. As soon as the rescued orangutans have moved out of quarantine, they spend long hours in the forest in as natural an environment as possible. They are taught essential forest survival skills in a large forested area between the cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda.The aim is to provide sanctuary to illegally captured or directly threatened orangutans, as well as to rehabilitate orphaned orangutans, with the goal of releasing them back into the wild. Only about 50,000 Bornean orangutans are left in the world, with numbers plummeting over the last 70 years. Loss of rainforest to oil palm plantations or coal mining leads orangutans into conflict with humans. Orphans are snatched from their dead mothers and are sold or held illegally as pets.

How coronavirus is driving a revolution in travel,"Barriers closed a stretch of Deansgate, Manchester's main thoroughfare, to motor vehicles on Saturday.Elsewhere in the city, new pedestrian walkways and pop-up bike lanes have appeared. It is part of a nationwide effort to create more space for social distancing as the country gradually begins to lift the coronavirus restrictions.Glasgow, Leicester, York and Brighton have also created new space for walking or cycling this week.And dozens more UK towns and cities plan to do so.On Friday, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he would be shutting some of the busiest roads in the city.He said his plan to close large swathes of London to cars and vans would create one of the largest car-free areas of any city in the world.""Many Londoners have rediscovered the joys of walking and cycling during lockdown"", Mr Khan said.

""All those methods of transport are essential for economic recovery, so don't punish one group at the expense of the other"", he urges.Manchester has dubbed its campaign to encourage walking and cycling ""Safe Streets Save Lives"".The city says it will use £5m of emergency funding to introduce changes where they are most needed, so outside shops, transport hubs or on routes to hospitals.The aim is that these initiatives will help achieve the authority's goal of making the city carbon-neutral by 2038 as well as creating a healthier, more pleasant city.The focus is not just on the city centre.Levenshulme in south-east Manchester will see some of the most dramatic traffic calming measures in the entire region.The plan is that 30 traffic filters made of heavy concrete flower pots and bollards will close much of the neighbourhood to through traffic over the next few weeks.""We have consulted with the community and they say want to make this area a nicer place to live"", says Levenshulme resident Pauline Johnson. She said the response from local people has been overwhelmingly positive.""They say they want this to be somewhere where children can play safely in the streets.""Greater Manchester's cycling commissioner Chris Boardman, says cycling has increased by more than 70% on some days since the lockdown in the region.""What coronavirus has shown is that if you give people safe, traffic free streets they will walk more and ride bikes"", he told the BBC.""If we don't take steps to enable people to keep traveling actively, we risk a huge spike in car use as measures are eased"", the Olympic gold winner said.""Not only is it the right thing to do to protect people now, but it's vital to meet our clean air goals and protect our NHS long-term.""Lockdown has certainly prompted a boom in bike sales. At one point this week shares in Halfords, the country's biggest chain of cycle shops, had jumped 17%.The company said sales of some cycling equipment had risen 500% since the government ordered us all to stay at home on March 23rd.Ken Foster says his bike shop, Foster's Cycles, in the Manchester suburb of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, is the busiest it has been since his grandfather opened it back in 1954.But it has been exceptionally good weather.  What happens when it rains?""There is no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing"", says Ken Foster with a laugh.Follow Justin on Twitter.",16 May 2020,science
'Golden tongue' helps ensure maple syrup quality,"Scientists have developed a ""golden tongue"" to help producers test the quality of maple syrup.A team of researchers from Canada used the precious metal to develop a way of checking whether samples were ""off flavour"".The test used nanoparticles of gold, which normally looked red but appeared blue when the sample of syrup was deemed to be below a premium grade.The details have been published in the Analytical Methods journal.Maple syrup is synonymous with the north-eastern reaches of North America. Its production is one of the oldest agriculture enterprises in the US and Canada, with a history stretching back hundreds of years. Native Americans first discovered the elixir made from the sap of sugar maples, before passing on the technique to settlers. Today, the global market for maple syrup is estimated to be in excess of US$1.2bn (£970m).Once the first signs of spring are on the temporal horizon and the sap in the sugar maples (Acer saccharum) begins to rise, farmers set up a network of taps in the trunk of the trees to draw off the sweet produce.On average, the maple syrup season lasts for four to six weeks, with the sweetness and robustness of flavour changing over that period.In order to produce the maple syrup that we pour over pancakes or use in cooking, the sap flows from the trees to sugar shacks or sugar huts, where the fluid is boiled and much of its water content is evaporated. From an initial mixture of 98% water and 2% sugar, the finished syrup consists of 33% water and 67% sugar. On average, 40 litres of sap is needed to produce one litre of syrup.Just as the characteristic of wine is determined by the ""terroir"", in other words the unique aspects of the vineyard, such as temperature, soil, slope of the land, rainfall; the same is true with maple syrup. Each farm's produce has its own signature flavour.However, the US and Canada have a grading system to help consumers distinguish between different varieties produced during the sap season, based on strength of flavour.Early season syrup is lighter in colour and has a more delicate flavour compared with the darker, more robust flavoured syrups that come towards the end of the short production season.In order to help grade their products, producers approached a team at the University of Montreal.""The Quebec Maple Syrup Producers approached us in 2017 to help them develop a test that could identify maple syrups presenting a different flavour profile, occurring mainly late in the harvest,"" co-author Jean-Francois Masson, a professor of chemistry at the university, explained.Prof Masson's team specialises in the use of gold nanomaterials and realised it could use the nanoparticles (about 100th the width of a human hair) of the precious metal to produce a colour test for the Quebec producers, who are responsible for about 70% of the world's supply of maple syrup.""Gold no longer appears a shiny yellow colour (at this scale) but a deep red colour. The presence of molecules associated with the different flavour profile causes the gold nanoparticles to clump, which is associated with a colour change to a deep blue,"" he told BBC News.""As such, the test works very similarly to a pH or chlorine test for swimming pools.""Prof Masson explained the team used gold because only a very small amount was needed to run a test (about one millionth of a gram). Also, the material's colour change was easily detected by a ""simple spectrophotometer"", and gold reacted well to certain molecules in maple syrup.He hopes the test will be beneficial to producers in a variety of ways.""The producers currently request a tool to help them manage the harvest year and to decide on which days they should produce maple syrup leading to premium quality,"" he said.""The industry may benefit from the tool, as it can help identify 'off-flavour' maple syrups and this (can) assist trained technicians [to assess] the proper grade of the 300,000 barrels produced each year in Quebec.""Off-flavour refers to produce that does not have the expected taste of a premium grade syrup. However, these syrups are still edible and are often used in industrial processes as an added ingredient rather than being sold as a premium grade product.",16 May 2020,science
