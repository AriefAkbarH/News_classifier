Coronavirus: Quarantine rules for some countries set to be relaxed,"The government is planning to relax its travel quarantine rules in early July for some countries.UK officials are talking to their counterparts in Portugal, France, Italy, Greece and Spain. However, the UK hopes to make an announcement on 29 June that it has secured a number of ""travel corridors"". The government had previously said that the quarantine would be reviewed every three weeks and 29 June marks the end of the first three-week period. A travel corridor would mean that two people travelling in both directions between two countries would not have to self-isolate after they travel.The first travel corridors could come into force on 4 July, although that date is by no means confirmed. Even if certain routes are exempt, the  travel quarantine for people arriving from other destinations will remain in place. A senior aviation source has told the BBC that the quarantine could remain throughout the summer for anyone arriving from countries which do not have a travel corridor with the UK.  Portugal's foreign minister previously said that anyone in the UK thinking of going to Portugal this summer would be ""most welcome"" despite the coronavirus pandemic. Augusto Santos Silva said he hoped an ""air bridge"" between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June.However, the broader travel quarantine is expected to remain in place. For more on the rules click here.Anyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine upon arrival in the UK.There are also exemptions for workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care.The travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk. Some airlines were in the early stages of legal action.The manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses.Despite criticism from businesses, Home Secretary Priti Patel said that the measures were ""proportionate"" and being implemented ""at the right time"" when they came into effect on 8 June.",19 June 2020,business
UK debt now larger than size of whole economy,"The UK's debt is now worth more than its economy after the government borrowed a record amount in May. The £55.2bn figure was nine times higher than in May last year and the highest since records began in 1993.The borrowing splurge sent total government debt surging to £1.95trn, exceeding the size of the economy for the first time in more than 50 years.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures confirmed the severe impact the virus was having on public finances.""The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work. ""We've set out our plan to do this in a gradual and safe fashion, including reopening high streets across the country this week, as we kickstart our economic recovery,"" he added.Income from tax, National Insurance and VAT all dived in May amid the coronavirus lockdown as spending on support measures soared.This is the first time debt has been larger than the size of the economy since 1963, but it is not as high as the post-war peak of 258% in 1946-47.The deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - for the first two months of the financial year (April and May) is now estimated to have been £103.7bn, £87bn more than in the same period last year, another record. But the ONS estimates borrowing for the 2020-21 financial year will dwarf that at £298bn. That would be the largest deficit since World War Two. It cautioned that due to the coronavirus, its official estimates were subject to greater than usual uncertainty.The Office for National Statistics had previously said that April's borrowing figure was the highest since records began in 1993, but it subsequently revised the figure down to £48.5bn from £62bn.The revision was due to higher than expected income from taxes and national insurance, as well as the spending on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme being lower than originally estimated.Alex Tuckett, senior economist at consultants PwC, pointed to the 46% fall in the amount of VAT collected in the month, although it said the biggest issue for the government's finances was the £29bn it spent on the various support schemes for the economy.""In the near term, there are signs the economy is recovering as the country re-opens, and this should boost tax receipts. ""However, these figures remind us that Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a difficult backdrop to any summer fiscal event.""Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Economics said the emergency support measures had placed a ""colossal burden"" on the public finances. In a release packed with striking figures, he singled out the fact the government had needed to raise more cash in the first two months of this fiscal year than in total in any prior 10 fiscal years. Busting the overdraft, with a borrowing figure nine times as high as a year ago is not an easy thing for any government to swallow. In his first full year as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak is on track for the biggest public sector deficit since World War Two, But it is, he reckons, a price worth paying to prevent a bigger cost to the economy, in terms of lost jobs and output. Billions have been pumped into supporting millions of jobs, and many businesses, while, on the other side, tax receipts have plunged. Those lifelines will be wound down in the coming months, and the government can borrow cheaply on financial markets to fund them.  But what happens next? As lockdown is eased, the Treasury is watching closely, knowing the recovery may need extra support - perhaps tax cuts or more spending. That will present the government with more bills - but failing to provide more help risks an even higher cost. The chancellor is to present some sort of statement before Parliament ceases for the summer in July - that won't be a full Budget but may contain some measures to boost the recovery.  The tough choices aren't over yet. ",19 June 2020,business
Colgate reviews China's Darlie brand amid race debate,"Colgate-Palmolive is reviewing Chinese toothpaste brand Darlie as firms reassess race stereotypes in products.The name of the popular Chinese brand translates as ""black person toothpaste"".It is owned by Colgate and its joint venture partner Hawley & Hazel and sold widely across Asia.A string of high-profile brands are also reviewing names and logos in light of the racism demonstrations and debate in the US.The toothpaste brand was originally called Darkie before it was changed to Darlie in 1989, following pressure from shareholders and other groups.""For more than 35 years, we have been working together to evolve the brand, including substantial changes to the name, logo and packaging.  We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,"" a Colgate spokesman told the BBC. Colgate paid $50m (£40m) in 1985 for 50% of Hong Kong-based Hawley & Hazel, the maker of Darlie. The brand controls 17% of the toothpaste market in China, 21% in Singapore, 28% in Malaysia and 25% in Taiwan, according to data firm Euromonitor International.On Wednesday, PepsiCo said it was changing its Aunt Jemima branding, while other food brands featuring African-American characters are reviewing their logos. Mars said it was considering possible changes to the branding of its Uncle Ben's rice, which entered the market in the 1940s.Racial injustice is under the spotlight following the death of African-American George Floyd while being detained by police. This sparked demonstrations around the world and gave further impetus to the Black Lives Matter movement.

DIY spending splurge helps May sales recover,"UK retail sales partly recovered in May, driven by DIY stores and garden centres reopening amid the lockdown.The amount of goods sold last month increased by 12%, in comparison with record falls seen in April, according to the Office for National Statistics.Sales were boosted by a 42% rise at household goods stores, such as hardware, furniture and paint shops.Despite the rebound seen in May, retail sales still remain well below pre-lockdown levels.Non-essential retailers in England and Northern Ireland have, however, since been allowed to reopen.Most shops in Scotland are to reopen from 29 June. Non-essential retailers in Wales will be told they can reopen from Monday, the first minister is expected to announce on Friday.Non-food stores saw the biggest increase in sales last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, with DIY sales providing a bright spot.""According to retailers in this sector, consumers appeared to be carrying out home improvements while spending more time than usual in their homes,"" the ONS said.However, despite the May boost, sales overall were still down by 13.1% compared with February, before the coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced. In the three months to May, sales fell by 12.8% compared with the previous three months, the fastest quarterly decline since records began in 1996.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, cautioned that the ""overall consumer picture remains bleak"".""May's recovery in retail sales should not be interpreted as a sign that the economy is embarking on a healthy V-shaped recovery from Covid-19,"" he said.""Naturally, spending on goods will recover faster than on services, which usually require human contact and remain largely unavailable.""May's retail sales were always going to be better than the off-the-charts collapse in April, when the full force of the lockdown was underway.The decline is now reversing. But it's far from clear when retail sales will return to pre-Covid-19 levels. When non-essential shops re-opened in England on Monday, with lots of queues for some of the most popular stores, footfall was still far lower than normal. And with social distancing in place, retailers will have to limit customer numbers where necessary. Fewer customers will mean fewer sales. With unemployment set to rise and the various government support schemes starting to ebb away, many people's finances will start to come under real pressure. Online sales rose to their highest proportion on record in May while consumers stayed at home. They accounted for 33.4% of total spending, compared with 30.8% in April, the ONS added. Lynda Petherick, head of retail for Accenture UK and Ireland, said: ""Given the wholesale shifts in consumer behaviour these last few months, it would be optimistic to assume shopping habits will return to normal in the immediate future. ""As the proportion of shoppers buying online continues to soar, the individual retailers who best recover in this new environment will be those who can quickly adapt to accelerating trends, such as the shift to ecommerce,"" she added.Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, told the BBC's Today programme that the chain's online sales had ""gained a lot of momentum"" in April and May.He added that he hoped to see the same ""kickback"" in stores after non-essential retailers in England were allowed to reopen on 15 June.""I think that as consumer confidence continues to grow though, that the level of footfall will grow with it,"" Mr Cowgill added.On Monday, stores across England selling non-essential goods opened their doors for the first time since the lockdown began. Shoppers arrived early to centre:mk in Milton Keynes. Some were picking up goods they had been waiting months to buy, such as baby clothes and home furnishings. Others were there for the sales. These shoppers told us what they bought - and why.Read more here.Action Fraud warned on Friday that customers should take additional care when shopping online during lockdown.Since shops were forced to close due on 23 March, the UK's reporting centre for fraud has received reports of online shopping fraud totalling £16.6m in losses.However, separate research suggests that shoppers might be feeling anxious about their return to the High Street.More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years, according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY.Silvia Rindone, partner in consumer product and retail at EY, said that retailers ""must do all they can to help alleviate customers' concerns"".""People need to know the shopping environment and communal space is safe and that the brand is taking health and safety as seriously as they are.""",19 June 2020,business

""We need to really address these issues at a structural level so that workers are able to have access to good wages and good working conditions.""""But just because working people are reminded, doesn't mean that our policymakers are going to legislate and change policies to meet the needs,"" she adds.Ms Williams says she hopes pressure for change is growing. Two years ago, she joined the Carroll Garden Nanny Association, an activist group, drawn primarily by the offer of CPR training. But her interest in wider employment matters has blossomed and she says an uptick in participation in the group's chats and Zoom calls since the start of the pandemic suggests she's not alone.Ms Williams knows much of the new interest reflects the current crisis, and people at home with time on their hands.""I only hope that when things get back to some type of normalcy that they stay focused,"" she says.",19 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Four out of five people's jobs hit by pandemic,"A total of 81% of the global workforce of 3.3 billion people have had their workplace fully or partly closed.Restrictions on daily life have led to the closure of many companies and the laying off of staff - either permanently or temporarily.The International Labour Organization (ILO), an agency of the United Nations, has been looking at the global impact with a series of charts.Their work shows the global scale of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.""Workers and businesses are facing catastrophe, in both developed and developing economies,"" said ILO director general Guy Ryder. ""We have to move fast, decisively, and together. The right, urgent, measures, could make the difference between survival and collapse.""The outbreak is expected to wipe out 6.7% of working hours across the world during the second quarter of 2020.That is the equivalent of 195 million full-time workers losing their jobs.The worst-hit region is predicted to be the Arab states, with an 8.1% decline in working hours (five million full-time workers).The ILO says it is ""the most severe crisis"" since World War Two.It adds that the eventual increase in global unemployment during the course of 2020 will depend largely on two factors:There is a high risk that the end-of-year worldwide unemployment figure will be much higher than an initial ILO projection of 25 million people.Different sectors of the economy have been hit in different ways by the sudden downturn in work.Not surprisingly, with travel at a minimum and social lives put on hold, the accommodation and food services industries are among those suffering most, along with manufacturing, wholesale and retail, and real estate and business.Together, they account for nearly 38% of the global workforce, with 1.25 billion people employed in these industries around the world.The percentage of people around the world in high-risk jobs varies considerably.A total of 43.2% of people in the Americas and 42.1% in Europe and Central Asia work in high-risk sectors.These regions have far fewer informal workers, who make up the majority of the workforce in Africa, the Arab states and Asia and the Pacific.While these workers play a crucial role in the economy, especially in countries like India, Nigeria and Brazil, they miss out on things like social protection, that other permanent workers have.Mr Ryder said: ""This is the greatest test for international co-operation in more than 75 years.

Coronavirus: Quarantine rules for some countries set to be relaxed,"The government is planning to relax its travel quarantine rules in early July for some countries.UK officials are talking to their counterparts in Portugal, France, Italy, Greece and Spain. However, the UK hopes to make an announcement on 29 June that it has secured a number of ""travel corridors"". The government had previously said that the quarantine would be reviewed every three weeks and 29 June marks the end of the first three-week period. A travel corridor would mean that two people travelling in both directions between two countries would not have to self-isolate after they travel.The first travel corridors could come into force on 4 July, although that date is by no means confirmed. Even if certain routes are exempt, the  travel quarantine for people arriving from other destinations will remain in place. A senior aviation source has told the BBC that the quarantine could remain throughout the summer for anyone arriving from countries which do not have a travel corridor with the UK.  Portugal's foreign minister previously said that anyone in the UK thinking of going to Portugal this summer would be ""most welcome"" despite the coronavirus pandemic. Augusto Santos Silva said he hoped an ""air bridge"" between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June.However, the broader travel quarantine is expected to remain in place. For more on the rules click here.Anyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine upon arrival in the UK.There are also exemptions for workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care.The travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk. Some airlines were in the early stages of legal action.The manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses.Despite criticism from businesses, Home Secretary Priti Patel said that the measures were ""proportionate"" and being implemented ""at the right time"" when they came into effect on 8 June.",19 June 2020,business
UK debt now larger than size of whole economy,"The UK's debt is now worth more than its economy after the government borrowed a record amount in May. The £55.2bn figure was nine times higher than in May last year and the highest since records began in 1993.The borrowing splurge sent total government debt surging to £1.95trn, exceeding the size of the economy for the first time in more than 50 years.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures confirmed the severe impact the virus was having on public finances.""The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work. ""We've set out our plan to do this in a gradual and safe fashion, including reopening high streets across the country this week, as we kickstart our economic recovery,"" he added.Income from tax, National Insurance and VAT all dived in May amid the coronavirus lockdown as spending on support measures soared.This is the first time debt has been larger than the size of the economy since 1963, but it is not as high as the post-war peak of 258% in 1946-47.The deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - for the first two months of the financial year (April and May) is now estimated to have been £103.7bn, £87bn more than in the same period last year, another record. But the ONS estimates borrowing for the 2020-21 financial year will dwarf that at £298bn. That would be the largest deficit since World War Two. It cautioned that due to the coronavirus, its official estimates were subject to greater than usual uncertainty.The Office for National Statistics had previously said that April's borrowing figure was the highest since records began in 1993, but it subsequently revised the figure down to £48.5bn from £62bn.The revision was due to higher than expected income from taxes and national insurance, as well as the spending on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme being lower than originally estimated.Alex Tuckett, senior economist at consultants PwC, pointed to the 46% fall in the amount of VAT collected in the month, although it said the biggest issue for the government's finances was the £29bn it spent on the various support schemes for the economy.""In the near term, there are signs the economy is recovering as the country re-opens, and this should boost tax receipts. ""However, these figures remind us that Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a difficult backdrop to any summer fiscal event.""Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Economics said the emergency support measures had placed a ""colossal burden"" on the public finances. In a release packed with striking figures, he singled out the fact the government had needed to raise more cash in the first two months of this fiscal year than in total in any prior 10 fiscal years. Busting the overdraft, with a borrowing figure nine times as high as a year ago is not an easy thing for any government to swallow. In his first full year as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak is on track for the biggest public sector deficit since World War Two, But it is, he reckons, a price worth paying to prevent a bigger cost to the economy, in terms of lost jobs and output. Billions have been pumped into supporting millions of jobs, and many businesses, while, on the other side, tax receipts have plunged. Those lifelines will be wound down in the coming months, and the government can borrow cheaply on financial markets to fund them.  But what happens next? As lockdown is eased, the Treasury is watching closely, knowing the recovery may need extra support - perhaps tax cuts or more spending. That will present the government with more bills - but failing to provide more help risks an even higher cost. The chancellor is to present some sort of statement before Parliament ceases for the summer in July - that won't be a full Budget but may contain some measures to boost the recovery.  The tough choices aren't over yet. ",19 June 2020,business
Colgate reviews China's Darlie brand amid race debate,"Colgate-Palmolive is reviewing Chinese toothpaste brand Darlie as firms reassess race stereotypes in products.The name of the popular Chinese brand translates as ""black person toothpaste"".It is owned by Colgate and its joint venture partner Hawley & Hazel and sold widely across Asia.A string of high-profile brands are also reviewing names and logos in light of the racism demonstrations and debate in the US.The toothpaste brand was originally called Darkie before it was changed to Darlie in 1989, following pressure from shareholders and other groups.""For more than 35 years, we have been working together to evolve the brand, including substantial changes to the name, logo and packaging.  We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,"" a Colgate spokesman told the BBC. Colgate paid $50m (£40m) in 1985 for 50% of Hong Kong-based Hawley & Hazel, the maker of Darlie. The brand controls 17% of the toothpaste market in China, 21% in Singapore, 28% in Malaysia and 25% in Taiwan, according to data firm Euromonitor International.On Wednesday, PepsiCo said it was changing its Aunt Jemima branding, while other food brands featuring African-American characters are reviewing their logos.

DIY spending splurge helps May sales recover,"UK retail sales partly recovered in May, driven by DIY stores and garden centres reopening amid the lockdown.The amount of goods sold last month increased by 12%, in comparison with record falls seen in April, according to the Office for National Statistics.Sales were boosted by a 42% rise at household goods stores, such as hardware, furniture and paint shops.Despite the rebound seen in May, retail sales still remain well below pre-lockdown levels.Non-essential retailers in England and Northern Ireland have, however, since been allowed to reopen.Most shops in Scotland are to reopen from 29 June. Non-essential retailers in Wales will be told they can reopen from Monday, the first minister is expected to announce on Friday.Non-food stores saw the biggest increase in sales last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, with DIY sales providing a bright spot.""According to retailers in this sector, consumers appeared to be carrying out home improvements while spending more time than usual in their homes,"" the ONS said.However, despite the May boost, sales overall were still down by 13.1% compared with February, before the coronavirus lockdown measures were introduced. In the three months to May, sales fell by 12.8% compared with the previous three months, the fastest quarterly decline since records began in 1996.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, cautioned that the ""overall consumer picture remains bleak"".""May's recovery in retail sales should not be interpreted as a sign that the economy is embarking on a healthy V-shaped recovery from Covid-19,"" he said.""Naturally, spending on goods will recover faster than on services, which usually require human contact and remain largely unavailable.""May's retail sales were always going to be better than the off-the-charts collapse in April, when the full force of the lockdown was underway.The decline is now reversing. But it's far from clear when retail sales will return to pre-Covid-19 levels. When non-essential shops re-opened in England on Monday, with lots of queues for some of the most popular stores, footfall was still far lower than normal. And with social distancing in place, retailers will have to limit customer numbers where necessary. Fewer customers will mean fewer sales. With unemployment set to rise and the various government support schemes starting to ebb away, many people's finances will start to come under real pressure. Online sales rose to their highest proportion on record in May while consumers stayed at home. They accounted for 33.4% of total spending, compared with 30.8% in April, the ONS added. Lynda Petherick, head of retail for Accenture UK and Ireland, said: ""Given the wholesale shifts in consumer behaviour these last few months, it would be optimistic to assume shopping habits will return to normal in the immediate future. ""As the proportion of shoppers buying online continues to soar, the individual retailers who best recover in this new environment will be those who can quickly adapt to accelerating trends, such as the shift to ecommerce,"" she added.Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, told the BBC's Today programme that the chain's online sales had ""gained a lot of momentum"" in April and May.He added that he hoped to see the same ""kickback"" in stores after non-essential retailers in England were allowed to reopen on 15 June.""I think that as consumer confidence continues to grow though, that the level of footfall will grow with it,"" Mr Cowgill added.On Monday, stores across England selling non-essential goods opened their doors for the first time since the lockdown began.

Sunak urges US to back digital services tax,"The coronavirus crisis has made tech firms ""more powerful and more profitable"", the chancellor said in a letter signed by European counterparts.The letter from Rishi Sunak and finance ministers in France, Italy and Spain says tech giants, like Google, Amazon and Facebook, need ""to pay their fair share of tax"".International talks are taking place over how online sales should be taxed.But on Wednesday, the US said it had walked away from the negotiating table.The US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Congress the US had abandoned efforts to find a multilateral solution to taxing tech firms in talks overseen by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).He said other nations had ganged up to ""screw America"". In the letter, obtained by the BBC, the four finance ministers told the US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, that the pandemic had increased the need for such levies.""The current Covid-19 crisis has confirmed the need to deliver a fair and consistent allocation of profit made by multinationals operating without - or with little - physical taxable presence,"" the letter said.""The pandemic has accelerated a fundamental transformation in consumption habits and increased the use of digital services, consequently reinforcing digital business models' dominant position and increasing their revenue at the expense of more traditional businesses.""The letter continues: ""Digital giants, no matter where they are headquartered, will emerge from the current crisis more powerful and more profitable."" ""These companies benefit from free access to the European market. It is fair and legitimate to expect that they pay their fair share of tax within countries where they create value and profit.""The finance ministers' letter says a solution is still possible this year.

US jobless claims worse than expected despite reopening,"A further 1.5 million Americans filed for unemployment last week, a higher-than-expected number that signals the economic damage caused by the pandemic is continuing.Although reopening is underway throughout the country, the number of new applications for benefits fell by just 58,000, the Labor Department said.It was the 13th week in a row the figures have held above one million.The claims remain more than double the pre-pandemic record set in 1982.The smaller-than-expected decline in claims last week likely reflects ""some moderation"" in the pace of reopening, Wells Fargo economics said. US employers added a surprise 2.5 million jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell to 13.3%, the Labor Department said earlier in its monthly report.But most analysts expect the US unemployment rate to be above 9% at the end of the year - close to the high set in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.The Labor Department's report on Thursday showed more than 29 million people - nearly one in five American workers - continued to collect jobless benefits as of 30 May.""Like the threat posed by the virus, we must not become complacent about the level of human suffering associated with the economic downturn simply because of its persistence,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com.The head of the US central bank this week warned of ""significant uncertainty"" regarding the recovery and told Congress he thought further economic relief would be necessary.",18 June 2020,business

At the time, it was valued at €24bn, but following the latest share price crash this has fallen to just €4bn.The scandal came to light after a series of articles in the Financial Times last year focusing on alleged accounting irregularities in Wirecard's Asian operations.The missing money was supposed to be held in accounts at two Asian banks and had been set aside for ""risk management"", Wirecard said.However, EY auditors said the banks had been unable to provide the account numbers.Wirecard said there were ""indications that spurious balance confirmations had been provided"" by a trustee ""in order to deceive the auditor and create a wrong perception of the existence of such cash balances or the holding of the accounts"".""The Wirecard management board is working intensively together with the auditor towards a clarification of the situation,"" said the company.",18 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Qantas axes most overseas flights until October,"Qantas has cancelled all international flights until late October except for those to New Zealand.The news comes as the Australian government said its border would remain closed into next year to slow the spread of the coronavirus.The airline and subsidiary Jetstar are now boosting domestic flights as travel restrictions within Australia ease.Qantas has seen domestic passenger numbers double to 64,000 this week, compared to last week's 32,000.The nation's tourism minister has also encouraged Australians to take their holidays within the country this year. “With Australia’s borders set to remain closed for some time, we have cancelled most international flights until late October,"" the airline said in a statement sent to the BBC.""We still have some flights scheduled across the Tasman in the coming months, with the expected travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand,"" the statement continued, referring to the Tasman Sea between the two countries.The airline pointed to comments from Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham for its announcement on Thursday.Mr Birmingham said on Wednesday that the decision to shut the country's border was one of the main reasons Australia had been successful in fighting the spread of Covid-19 and it would not be reopened any time soon for general travel. ""I do sadly think that in terms of open tourist-related travel in or out of Australia, that remains quite some distance off,"" he told the National Press Club.When asked whether that would mean the border would remain closed until next year, Mr Birmingham said, ""I think that is more likely the case"".Qantas also reiterated that it will increase domestic flights to 15% of pre-coronavirus levels as some travel restrictions are lifted.At the same time the airline said that it is ready to ramp its international schedule as soon as government regulations allow. “Should travel between Australia and other countries open up and demand returns, we can add more flights back into our schedule.""Qantas, like many other carriers, has been hit hard by travel restrictions imposed around the world to combat the spread of the coronavirus.A number of high-profile airlines have been struggling to survive during the crisis including Virgin Australia, Thai Airways and Colombia's Avianca. Other airlines have been forced to layoff thousands of workers and downsize operations. Earlier this month the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned that the airline industry could suffer losses of more than $84bn (£67bn) this year.",18 June 2020,business
Have we become too reliant on Big Tech firms?,"""We wouldn't have survived without Amazon,"" says Keith Ingram, owner of vinyl records shop Assai Records.When lockdown hit on 23 March in the UK, Mr Ingram had to shut his shops in Edinburgh and Dundee, and sell his stock through Amazon Marketplace. Now, his sales are 40% higher than last year. ""Without Amazon, we would have had to furlough all employees for all of lockdown. Instead, we furloughed them for four weeks until we adjusted ourselves to the new normal, and then we could retrain staff to help us fulfil our online orders,"" he says.It's not just Amazon that has been used more during the pandemic. Apple and Android smartphones and tablets, Facebook's apps and Microsoft tools have provided crucial links with friends, family and colleagues.And that's certainly been great for investors and the billionaires behind these firms. Shares in Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft all hit all-time highs on the stock market in June.Between 18 March and 19 May, Amazon's Jeff Bezos saw his wealth swell by $34.6bn (£27.6bn) and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg's wealth rose by $25bn (£19.9bn), according to a recent report.But is this reliance on Big Tech getting out of control? ""Amazon have gone from being the dominant gatekeepers for online commerce to being the dominant gatekeeper for much of retail because of the lockdowns,"" says Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, the US organisation that challenges concentrated economic and political power.Meanwhile, this week the UK government announced that it would be using a coronavirus-tracing app based on technology from Apple and Google.Germany, Italy and Denmark are among other countries also using that system.Big Tech firms have been getting even bigger during the pandemic and their success means they have plenty of funds to snap up other businesses.For example, in May Facebook announced its second biggest deal - a plan to buy a 10% stake in India's Jio, a telecoms and digital services business.""All of them will be in the M&A [mergers and acquisitions] game if they're not already. Start-ups are more likely to sell out during the pandemic when they might struggle to meet their obligations and the buyout looks especially attractive - the pandemic is speeding up the buyout date in some cases,"" says Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a think-tank that studies corporate concentration.Before the pandemic, there had been scrutiny on Big Tech. The US House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee sent requests for information to Amazon, Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook in September 2019, with the government concerned that only a small number of companies hold such a big share of the digital market.Coronavirus may have delayed these investigations, but they will still be carried out.""Those focused on antitrust will renew their attention on big tech companies because we're in an election year [in the US] and both parties are going to want the attention on their efforts to regulate business,"" says Jonathan Osborne, a lawyer from Globalaw's law firm Gunster. Mr Vaheesan warns that in the US, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have not taken company acquisitions seriously enough - clearing the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp by Facebook, and YouTube and Android by Google.He is not optimistic that the DoJ and the FTC will change their approach in the future.In the UK, Amazon's multi-million pound investment in Deliveroo was provisionally cleared by competition chiefs because the takeaway courier said it would collapse if it was blocked. A final ruling is due on 6 August. ""That was a one-off, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looked at the market circumstances and saw them changing because of the pandemic, but the pandemic is not a reason for Big Tech companies to get away with scrutiny - absolutely not,"" says Jonathan Branton, head of competition at law firm DWF.The CMA has since announced it is investigating Facebook's acquisition of Giphy, the popular owner of a library of short animations and stickers used in social media.More Technology of BusinessBut is the current level of scrutiny enough, and will it change because of the pandemic?""It's hard to look into a crystal ball. I think Microsoft has taken a strong stance on trust, security and ethical use of AI, and while we've been focusing more on the crisis response in the short term, we still maintain and apply these principles and they will apply in the future. It's then about how public, industry and government look at that across the usage of Big Tech in the market,"" says Microsoft's Azure business lead Michael Wignall.Mr Vaheesan suggests that these major investigations into tech companies may not be what they seem.""It's too soon to say whether these are serious inquiries or whether they're merely a window dressing responding to the public and political concerns about the power of the big five tech companies.""In the US the picture is further complicated by President Trump's fraught relationship with Twitter.In May, for the first time, the company attached fact-check links to the President's tweets.That prompted a furious response from the White House with the President threatening to ""strongly regulate"" or even ""close down"" social media firms.Facebook has also been under pressure to remove comments made by the President, but has so far kept his posts up.Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can’t let a more sophisticated version of that....End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpTo help protect their interests, the Big Tech firms have hundreds of lobbyists working in Washington.""When I meet with elected representatives in Washington DC, they're almost a bit bereft that there are more lobbyists than they have staffers to write this legislation,"" says Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at NYU Stern.""The budgets at DoJ and the FTC have been cut every year, so although there's more likely to be anti-trust action with a change in the White House, the question is whether the US government even has the resources anymore,"" says Mr Galloway. Mr Galloway believes that Europe is more likely to take the lead on tougher sanctions against Big Tech than the US. ""Europe gets all of the downside of big tech... but they get very little of the upside. In the US, these are tremendous economic engines, providing a lot of jobs and a source of pride - they create that ecosystem of other successful companies around them,"" he says.The European Commission announced two new antitrust investigations into Apple this week, while a recent Wall Street Journal report suggested that Amazon could be next on the EU's agenda, over its treatment of third party sellers.""It raises the question: why are we so dependent on a handful of large companies? Would we actually lose anything as a society if we had multiple online marketplaces? There's really nothing that compels us to accept the present structure of these markets,"" says Mr Vaheesan. Big tech may be getting stronger during the pandemic, but it may actually make things harder for them in the long term.Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet were asked for a response but declined to comment.

Why a recession can be a good time to start a business,"What do General Motors, Burger King, CNN, Uber and Airbnb all have in common?They were all founded during economic downturns.GM launched in 1908, when the US economy was in turmoil after ""the Panic of 1907"" financial crisis. Meanwhile, Burger King flipped its first patty in 1953, when the US was again in recession, and CNN started its news broadcasts in 1980, when US inflation hit almost 15%.Both Uber and Airbnb set up business during the global financial crisis of 2007-09.These examples show that many of the best, and longest-lasting, companies are set up during downturns, according to Dane Strangler, a fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Centre, in Washington DC. He says that the difficult economic backdrop makes them both tougher and more nimble for years to come.""There's this trial by fire idea,"" he says. ""If you get started in a recession, you really have to scrape and scrimp to make that company successful.""You are trying to make it when you can't get financing, and trying to get customers when there isn't any demand.""We are certainly in a downturn again now, as a result of coronavirus and the subsequent lockdowns around the world.The World Bank predicts that the global economy will shrink by 5.2% in 2020, its worst performance since 1946 and the aftermath of World War Two. The US economy is already in recession, and the Bank of England predicts that the UK is about to see its sharpest downturn since 1706 . That's 314 years ago.But as history shows, successful companies can be born in tough times. Could there be promising start-ups from the entrepreneurial class of 2020 that will go on to become household names?More new businesses are certainly being set up despite - and as a result of - coronavirus. In the US, 67,160 applications were filed to set up new companies in the last week of May, official figures show.That was a 21% rise on the same seven days in 2019. Whereas from 2018 to 2019, the figure for that week declined by 3.3%.Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California Santa Cruz, says the latest increase is party because more people start businesses when jobs are scarce. He calls this ""necessity entrepreneurship"".""If someone doesn't have opportunities in a salaried job, that's part of the motivation [behind setting up their own company],"" he says.But some entrepreneurs may have had ideas for businesses stewing for a while.""With the shutdown people have had more time to think, and take time back from busy work schedules,"" says Prof Fairlie. ""So if there's a business idea they've had, they might think, let's try this out.""More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Other new start-ups have recognised that bleak as coronavirus is, it has presented business opportunities that also allow them to do their bit to help defeat the pandemic.This is especially true when it comes to PPE, or personal protective equipment, and the number of new firms set up in the past few months to fill a shortfall in supply.Matthew Campbell-Hill and his wife Lydia launched their business Aerosol Shield in April. The firm's eponymous product is a small, pop-up medical isolation shield or ""tent"". Transparent plastic sheeting attached to a plastic frame, it can be placed around a patient's head and shoulders, thereby reducing medical staff's exposure to the person's coughs.""We didn't set out to start a business, [but] we went from knowing about the issue to launching the company in six days, and taking bulk orders before we'd finished the seventh day,"" says Mr Campbell-Hill, who is a senior fellow at the University of Birmingham's Institute of Clinical Sciences.To make the shields, he and Lydia - who is a GP - worked with Airquee, a Welsh business that makes tents for armies and humanitarian organisations, and is also Europe's largest manufacturer of bouncy castles.Another UK business launched as a result of coronavirus is Hidden Smile, a facemask supplier set up earlier this month by Oxfordshire-based entrepreneur Neill Cotton.Its masks are made from two layers of cotton, with a folded paper filter inside.""You don't need to replace the filter as often, as it isn't exposed to the outside world, nor, crucially, to the moisture of the mouth,"" says Mr Cotton. ""You also look like an extra from [medical TV drama] Holby City.""Other industries that have seen a big rise in business as a result of coronavirus, and therefore offer opportunities to new start-ups, include home improvement and the delivery sector.Nicole Gibbons, who founded US paint firm Clare in 2018, says that sales have soared as a result of the lockdown. ""Normally people would rather have brunch on weekends, and not paint their homes."" she says. ""But now they have cabin fever, and want to do something.""Meanwhile, London-based courier business Gophr says it has just seen its busiest ever two months as more people have got a taste for online shopping.For anyone thinking of now setting up their own business, Markus Berger de Leon, a partner at management consultancy McKinsey, says think long and hard before you make the plunge. But if you do jump, then move quickly.""You really need to think, 'should I spend my next pound or euro on this, or something else?',"" he says.""And that makes you need to embrace and scale one skill that is core to your company. And think about doing that with as little money, as fast as possible. The start-ups that survive a recession are the ones that learn the fastest.""",18 June 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Construction safety is 'broken' say fire chiefs,"Some construction firms still can’t be trusted to make buildings that are safe from fire, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) has warned.Its safety head Nick Coombe said some building firms had barely improved since the Grenfell disaster in 2017. The Federation of Master Builders, which represents small contractors, said it was trying to create a safer industry, with licensed firms.Build UK, which represents the wider industry, declined to comment.The National Fire Chiefs Council said the construction industry was “broken” and couldn’t be trusted to follow rules.Mr Coombe said many reforms were needed, especially to building regulations, which allow builders to choose an inspector to certify their building safety.The current inspection system was devised by the government in the 1980s to speed up the timetable for buildings.Ministers were concerned that local council inspectors were delaying projects, so they allowed private inspectors to compete on speed of approval and cost.Tower block ""free-for-all""The builder effectively employs the safety inspector: critics say it’s like students choosing who they’ll pay to mark their exams – except people’s lives are risk. Mr Coombe said: “This doesn't drive standards up. It means the developer controls the amount of visits from a building inspector. We have had people shopping around for building controllers who would accept their work.“If you build a house extension the local authority are all over you. If you build a tower block or a shopping centre there’s a free-for-all.”Mr Coombe’s comments amplify a recent NFCC submission to a post-Grenfell review of building regulations.In that document the fire council warn: “It is our opinion that some within the wider industry are not acting responsibly when designing and approving buildings.  “Banning things [such as flammable cladding] is no guarantee that people will follow the rules, and it is our view that much of the combustible cladding on the side of buildings is already banned under the current regime.“To date, there is little evidence of a culture change [since Grenfell]. There is much more to be done to ensure the safety of building occupants, now and in the future. “NFCC advocates that the current building control system is overhauled to ensure that it is robust, independent of client and market influence, and has sufficient teeth to enforce appropriate fire safety standards as necessary.”Safety disagreementsThe response to the horrific Grenfell fire has had some side-effects. Some building firms report huge delays to construction, while developers, architects and builders argue over liability for safety.The Grenfell effect has also deterred architects from designing buildings with wood in the wall construction. Governments in the USA, Canada and Europe are promoting the use of timber in buildings to help combat climate change, because it locks in CO2 that trees have taken from the atmosphere.The USA, for instance, has certified 17-storey wood framed buildings after extensive fire testing. Meanwhile in the UK the government proposes that the maximum height of buildings with wood in the walls to be no more than four storeys.Fires tests neededMr Coombe said the NFCC didn’t want to block the use of wood in buildings, but insisted that fire safety tests should be done in the UK to prove the safety of design.A government spokesperson said: “The Grenfell Tower fire was a devastating tragedy and we are as determined as ever to ensure this can never happen again.“Safety is paramount – that’s why we’ve announced the biggest changes to building safety in a generation which will deliver meaningful and lasting change for residents.“We are carefully considering the responses to our consultation and will respond in due course.”Brian Berry from the Federation of Master Builders said: “Our members, the vast majority of whom work in domestic repair and maintenance or are small house builders, know that quality and safety must be at the heart of building projects.  “We are leading moves to create a more professionalised industry and advocate licensing of all UK construction companies.” BuildUK has a very broad membership across the industry and on some issues its members find it difficult to reach a consensus.",20 June 2020,business
Colgate reviews China's Darlie brand amid race debate,"Colgate-Palmolive is reviewing Chinese toothpaste brand Darlie as firms reassess race stereotypes in products.The name of the popular Chinese brand translates as ""black person toothpaste"".It is owned by Colgate and its joint venture partner Hawley & Hazel and sold widely across Asia.A string of high-profile brands are also reviewing names and logos in light of the racism demonstrations and debate in the US.The toothpaste brand was originally called Darkie before it was changed to Darlie in 1989, following pressure from shareholders and other groups.""For more than 35 years, we have been working together to evolve the brand, including substantial changes to the name, logo and packaging.  We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,"" a Colgate spokesman told the BBC. Colgate paid $50m (£40m) in 1985 for 50% of Hong Kong-based Hawley & Hazel, the maker of Darlie. The brand controls 17% of the toothpaste market in China, 21% in Singapore, 28% in Malaysia and 25% in Taiwan, according to data firm Euromonitor International.On Wednesday, PepsiCo said it was changing its Aunt Jemima branding, while other food brands featuring African-American characters are reviewing their logos. Mars said it was considering possible changes to the branding of its Uncle Ben's rice, which entered the market in the 1940s.Racial injustice is under the spotlight following the death of African-American George Floyd while being detained by police. This sparked demonstrations around the world and gave further impetus to the Black Lives Matter movement. Corporate America has been forced to tackle the issue.Many British firms have also been under pressure, including brewer Greene King, Lloyd's of London and banks RBS and Lloyds Banking Group admitting former links to slave trading.",19 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Credit card freeze extended for three months,"Banks have been told to give more time to millions of people struggling with debt owing to the coronavirus crisis.Credit card, store card, catalogue credit and personal loan customers will be able to defer repayments for another three months.The help was first ordered by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in April. Anyone taking advantage of the freeze must still pay back the debt at the end of the deferral period.This has prompted debt charities to warn of the potential for individuals' financial problems to simply be stored up for a later date.  The FCA said that if borrowers could resume their repayments they should do so, to avoid getting into more serious difficulty in the future. Banks may also be stricter in who qualifies for the payment deferral, and might only agree to a reduction in minimum repayments.The regulator stressed that using the payment deferral should not affect a borrower's credit rating. However, it warned that loan providers did have other ways to check on whether payment holidays had been taken, such as asking for bank statements, when making decisions on whether to agree to credit applications.Alongside the help for credit and store cards, bank customers have already been allowed to apply for an interest-free overdraft of up to £500. The FCA confirmed that these would also be extended for three months. Anyone wanting to take advantage for the first time can apply by the end of October.However, the FCA has not extended the guidance that ensured overdraft customers were no worse off on price when compared with the prices they were charged before planned rule changes on overdrafts.Sarah Coles, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Banks will be able to ramp up overdraft charges to the sky-high levels they were planning before this all kicked off. Suddenly you could be left paying around 40% interest on your coronavirus debts.""This feels like an awful time to be dropping this kind of burden on people.""On Friday, the FCA said it did not propose to extend this temporary measure. The overdraft rules benefit some people, primarily those who had previously fallen into using unarranged overdrafts. Although these extensions are currently proposals, banks only have until Monday to comment and the FCA expects the rules to be implemented soon after. Help for people with car finance, payday loans, rent-to-own deals, pawnbroking, and buy-now-pay-later agreements will be updated by the regulator at a later date.""The proposals would provide an expected minimum level of financial support for consumers who remain in, or enter, temporary financial difficulty due to coronavirus,"" said Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA.""Where consumers can afford to make payments, it is in their best long-term interest to do so, but for those who need help, it will be there.""Banks pointed out that many people would still be charged interest during payment deferrals, which would increase the debt.""Any customer with concerns over their financial situation should check with their lender to see what support would be the best option for them,"" said Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, which represents lenders.More leeway on credit repayments will come as a huge relief to many families juggling bills during the crisis.These continued interest-free overdrafts could be a life saver.But, aside from overdraft costs, the help is not free money.You will have to make up missed payments on credit cards and loans once the so-called holiday is over.So you could face an even bigger crunch later on, at a time when jobs and livelihoods may still be in danger.",19 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Charity donations tumble at lockdown funerals,"Father-of-two James Whiteside was a colourful man - both in character and in dress sense. He died of lung cancer at the end of April, aged 68.James, often known as Jim, was part of a big family and had made many friends in his village, as well as through his love of golf, and had contacts from 50 years in the construction industry.His wife Denise said at least 150 people would have wanted to attend his funeral near their home in Bearsted, Kent. Only 10 were permitted, owing to the coronavirus lockdown.The result was not only scores of people unable to pay their respects in person, but also far less money donated to charity than would otherwise have been the case.""We made a small donation ourselves, but with nobody else going, we could not ask,"" said Mrs Whiteside.She would have wanted donations to the British Lung Foundation for research to help prevent the disease, as well as helping smokers like her husband to give up.""We felt privileged that James had medication at his disposal during his illness. It was research that allowed that to happen,"" she said.The charity says the lower attendance at funerals means this type of donation - often cash in a collection plate at the service - has dropped to a fifth of its normal level.This so-called In Memoriam fundraising usually brings in £1m a year for the British Lung Foundation. It is the third largest source of income, after legacies and trusts.""Part of families' bereavement is to give back to charities that have supported them,"" said James Culling, the charity's director of fundraising.""The donations support our services to give hope, help and a voice to people.""Given the nature of coronavirus and its affect on breathing, the respiratory health charity - which recently merged with Asthma UK - has seen a surge in demand for its services at a time when income has been hit. People who are shielding have been particularly keen for information.The government announced a £750m package to keep struggling charities afloat at the start of April, but Mr Culling said his charity was unlikely to be eligible for the support.He also feared that a prolonged economic downturn, and less income for individuals, would affect donations in the longer term.The problem is not unique to his charity. Research by the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) said less cash usage could hit spontaneous donations, with most people still wanting to give in notes and coins.A third of charities had seen an increase in demand for their services since lockdown, while half had seen a drop in donations, its survey found.Particularly hard-hit have been medical charities, which had often been the beneficiaries of donations made in memory of loved ones.""There is no doubt that medical research charities in the UK will all be facing serious shortfalls,"" said Susan Pickney, head of research at the CAF.That could affect everyone in every street in the UK. Two grieving women, living on the same road in Wiltshire, understand what that means.Margaret Platt lost her husband of 53 years, Bill, to Covid-19 at the end of March. For decades he had managed his asthma.""I can imagine how difficult it must be for people to isolate for so long with asthma,"" she said.Rita Bailey also lost her husband, Bob, in April to Covid-19. He also suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, which put him at higher risk of catching the virus. The funeral was attended by eight people, there was no collection, and Mrs Bailey was unable to give cash to the funeral directors because of coronavirus transmission concerns.It was a situation, she said, that was upsetting for her, and - owing to its repetition on a wider scale - may affect the work of charities across the UK.",19 June 2020,business
