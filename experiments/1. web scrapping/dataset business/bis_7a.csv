"Coronavirus: Rolls-Royce to cut 9,000 jobs amid virus crisis","Rolls-Royce has said it will cut 9,000 jobs and warned it will take ""several years"" for the airline industry to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.The Derby-based firm, which makes plane engines, said the reduction of nearly a fifth of its workforce would mainly affect its civil aerospace division.""This is not a crisis of our making. But it is the crisis that we face and must deal with,"" boss Warren East said.The bulk of the job cuts are expected to be in the UK at its site in Derby.Rolls-Royce employs 52,000 people globally and Mr East told the BBC's Today programme that the company had not yet concluded on ""exactly"" where the job losses would be, due to having to consult with unions.But he said: ""It's fair to say that of our civil aerospace business approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that's probably a good first proxy.""Roll-Royce's civil aerospace business has a number of sites in the UK, but the largest plant is in Derby.Unite the union said the decision was ""shameful opportunism"".""This company has accepted public money to furlough thousands of workers,"" said Unite's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner.""Unite and Britain's taxpayers deserve a more responsible approach to a national emergency.

Coronavirus: How will airlines get flying again?,"Aviation is the most global of global industries. It employs millions of people, underpins the livelihoods of tens of millions more, and acts as part of the central nervous system of international business and leisure.Yet now vast parts of the network have been shut down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of daily flights has fallen by 80% since the start of the year, and in some regions nearly all passenger traffic has been suspended.The industry is in survival mode, with airlines, airports and ground-handling firms all desperate to conserve their cash reserves, while their normal revenue streams have dried up.Widespread job losses are now expected, with British Airways' parent company IAG announcing on Tuesday that it is set to cut up to 12,000 positions from the airline's 42,000-strong workforce.  IAG said it did not expect BA to see passenger demand return to 2019 levels for ""several years"".Elsewhere, Easyjet has laid off its 4,000 UK-based cabin crew for two months, Qantas has put 20,000 staff on leave, and 700 pilots at American Airlines have agreed to take early retirement.Even so, attention is now gradually turning to the future, and how airlines around the world can hope to slowly return to something approaching normality.There are obvious logistical challenges. Aircraft need to be prepared for flight, and airports made ready to receive them. Schedules need to be drawn up, and staff made available. But there are also less predictable issues to contend with. No-one can be quite sure yet where aircraft will be allowed to fly to, or what conditions might be imposed on staff and passengers by national authorities.There are currently around 17,000 aircraft parked up at airports around the world, according to consultants Ascend by Cirium. That represents about two-thirds of the global fleet.BA, for example, has aeroplanes stored at London Heathrow, at its maintenance base in Cardiff, on taxiways at regional airports such as Bournemouth, and at Chateauroux airport in France.Even while parked, these aircraft require regular maintenance. Some will have been kept ready for immediate use. Many airlines have been carrying out repatriation flights, for example, or ad-hoc cargo services. But others will take a week or longer to prepare for flight, according to people within the industry. If all those aircraft were needed at once, getting them ready would be a formidable challenge. However, analysts say in practice this is unlikely to be the case - because most airlines will start off by operating relatively limited schedules, and many aircraft will not actually be needed for months to come. A further significant issue is the raft of human qualifications needed to allow the industry to function. Pilots, for example, need time in the air, or in the simulator, to maintain their ""ratings"", or permits to fly specific aircraft. They also need regular medical checks.  Other critical staff, such as air traffic control personnel and engineers, have time-limited qualifications as well. Although many airlines and airports are trying to ensure they still have a core of staff available with up-to-date certificates - those who are involved in dealing with repatriation and cargo flights, for example - others have been unable to continue working. In the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has already taken steps to prevent a backlog of expired credentials from undermining attempts to get planes back in the air as quickly as possible.  ""Due to the extraordinary current circumstances, an exemption has been put in place,"" a spokesperson said.""Where possible, we expect pilots to remain current through normal methods. If the exemption is being deployed, an airline must illustrate to us how this is being done safely.""Similar measures have been put in place for other key staff.But while there are clear logistical problems involved with getting thousands of aircraft back into service, and ensuring there are enough pilots and technicians to go around, these are not the main issues keeping aviation executives awake at night.The real problem, executives say, is the number of different countries that have introduced travel restrictions, and the lack of certainty over when those restrictions will be removed. ""What we are trying to do is have a global restart plan,"" explains Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association. ""The main challenge is how and when the different states will lift restrictions to travel.""He believes curbs on travel will clearly last beyond the middle of the year, and some may remain at least partially in force until the end of 2020.He thinks domestic routes within individual countries will open up first, followed by short-haul international services. Intercontinental travel would probably follow after that, although he admits ""that is a point we haven't resolved yet"".One area causing a great deal of uncertainty is the extent to which social distancing will be required when regular flying resumes. How will people be separated in airport lounges, in security queues, or in the airports themselves? What tests will be required, and how will they be carried out?This is a commercial issue for both airports and airlines. For example, retail outlets and restaurants provide a lucrative source of revenues for airport operators.""Non-aeronautical revenues are really important to airports,"" says Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association.""They enable us to keep down the charges we make to airlines, and ultimately that affects the ticket prices they can offer their customers.""We don't want to reconfigure everything in our airports, only to find out in six months' time there's a vaccine and the new measures aren't needed any more.""IATA's argument is that whatever measures are introduced need to be the same and implemented in a co-ordinated fashion. ""We need to avoid the kind of situation that followed 9/11,"" says Mr de Juniac. ""Back then we saw a piling up of different kinds of security measures, and it took a very long time to put it together again in a more consistent way. And we still have different measures.""Airlines too could be squeezed. Lufthansa is already operating services where middle seats are left unoccupied in order to allow a certain degree of social distancing on board. EasyJet - which has grounded its entire fleet - says it will do the same when it resumes flying.As a short-term measure, this might help passengers fly with a little more confidence. But it comes at a serious cost.In order to make money, airlines need as many seats as possible to be filled on every flight. ""Load factors"" are particularly important for budget carriers, which typically fly with more than 90% of seats occupied.But if middle seats are left unoccupied, aircraft will have to fly just 65% full.  This might be acceptable for a short period, but according to Mr De Juniac, if it went on for long, ""it would certainly change the way in which the industry operates"".Ryanair's CEO Michael O""Leary has put it more succinctly, describing the idea as ""idiotic"".In the UK the government is considering forcing all passengers arriving in the country to spend two weeks in quarantine.The industry association Airlines UK says such a plan would ""effectively kill international travel to and from the UK, and cause immeasurable damage to the aviation industry and wider UK economy"".More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Getting aircraft back in the air may prove to be the easy part. Finding people to fly in them could prove more difficult - and some long-term changes to the aviation market are highly likely.""It may not be too bad for firms which specialise in holiday travel,"" explains one tourism industry executive.""People still want to go on holiday, and there's definitely still interest in going to short-haul destinations later in the year."" But analysts say business travel could be a different matter. High-paying business and first class travellers usually account for a little under a third of the revenues for the industry as a whole. For long-haul carriers, it can be as much as 70%.But there are now serious threats to that traffic. The predicted global recession, the cancellation of major trade fairs and other set-piece events - and even the new willingness of businesses to use online tools as a substitute for face-to-face meetings - could all delay the recovery.""I think we'll see a fusing of business models, and airlines trying different things,"" says analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting.""So you could see a sort of business class-lite, where people get a business class seat and meals, but no access to lounges. So at least the seat is occupied. There's room for a lot of creative pricing.""But the biggest problem for the entire industry, as it prepares to get back in the air, is that no-one - at any level - can really be sure what its future looks like.

Ryanair says passenger numbers set to halve,"Ryanair has said it expects passenger numbers to halve in the current financial year as the coronavirus crisis continues to blight air travel.The airline said it expected numbers to fall below 80 million, down from its original target of 154 million.But it said it would weather the pandemic and emerge stronger.Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair still planned to ramp up flights in July and said UK government quarantine plans were ""idiotic"".The prediction of lower passenger numbers came as Ryanair announced profits of just over €1bn (£894m) for the financial year to the end of March.The airline's profit was 13% up on the previous year's figure of €885m.Ryanair is set to cut 3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce - as it restructures to cope with the coronavirus crisis.Chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC's Today programme that Ryanair still intended to restart large numbers of flights from July, despite government plans to introduce a 14-day quarantine for people arriving in the UK, including returning holidaymakers.Mr O'Leary repeated his criticism of the quarantine plan, saying: ""It's idiotic and it's un-implementable. You don't have enough police in the UK.""He said the policy had ""no credibility"" and predicted that it would be gone by June.Ryanair said 2021 would be a ""difficult"" year as it worked hard to return to scheduled flying.

J&J to still sell baby powder in UK despite US ban,"Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson says it will continue to sell its talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder in the UK and the rest of the world, despite stopping sales in the US and Canada.It said North American sales had shrunk partly because of a ""constant barrage"" of advertising by lawyers seeking clients to claim against the company.J&J has been at the centre of claims for years that its talc causes cancer.It has always strenuously defended the product's safety.Johnson & Johnson has been ordered to pay out billions of dollars in compensation, but has so far always successfully appealed against these verdicts.Almost 20,000 people in the US have so far lodged claims against the company.Talc is mined from the earth and is found in seams close to that of asbestos, a material known to cause cancer. The company said in a statement: ""Johnson & Johnson remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder.""It said ""decades"" of study by medical and legal experts around the world supported its view, and all verdicts against the company that had gone against it had been overturned on appeal. It will continue to sell its talc-based products in the US and Canada until stocks have sold out. It also sells a cornstarch-based powder which it will continue to sell in North America.It said both types of Johnson's baby powder, talc-based and cornstarch-based, will continue to be sold in other markets around the world where there is ""significantly higher"" consumer demand for the product.  The firm said changes in consumer behaviour had also dampened demand for the powder. The firm added that the move was also part of a reassessment of its consumer products prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.It said in October that its testing had found no asbestos in its baby powder after tests conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration discovered trace amounts.The firm is appealing against a 2018 order to pay $4.7bn (£3.6bn) in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc products caused them to develop ovarian cancer.",20 May 2020,business
Toy and vegetable costs rise as fuel price drops,"The UK's inflation rate fell in April to its lowest since August 2016 as the economic fallout of the first month of the lockdown hit prices.The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) fell to 0.8% from 1.5% in March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.Falling petrol and diesel prices, plus lower energy bills, were the main drivers pushing inflation lower.But the prices of games and toys rose, which the ONS said may be due to people spending more time at home. However, there were 92 items in the ONS's basket of goods and services that it could not measure in April because they were mostly unavailable. These ranged from haircut prices, lemonade, manicures, cinema popcorn, and leisure activities involving sport. The ONS said it would monitor the issue for any distortion in the overall picture. But Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""While the coronavirus limited the availability of some goods and services, its effect on prices was more muted.""He said that food prices generally rose no more quickly than other goods and services, ""though fresh vegetables did see stronger rises"".The ONS said average petrol prices dropped by 10.4p a litre between March and April - the biggest fall since unleaded petrol records began in 1990 - amid a slump in global oil prices. Energy prices also pushed inflation lower as regulator Ofgem reduced its default tariff cap.The ONS said clothes retailers, hit during the early days of the lockdown by weaker footfall and then the closure of outlets, resorted to more discount sales than usual to try to shift their stock.Goods seeing upward pressure on prices included video games and consoles, board games and children's toys, the ONS said. And the price of knitting wool rose, another sign of the crafts and hobbies popular with people staying at home.Long-life products - such as cook-in sauces and frozen fish - also saw price hikes last month as consumers stocked up for life in lockdown.Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, said it was likely that as shops start re-opening retailers would deeply discount prices, putting further downward pressure on inflation.She also pointed to positive news for savers. ""For the first time in ages [savers] can now get above inflation interest rates on easy-access savings accounts - from more than one account.""CPI is now far below the Bank of England's 2% target, used as general guidance to help businesses set the right prices and for people to plan their spending.But while low inflation reduces the need for rises in interest rates and gives people a feeling the pound in their pocket stretches further, it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Low inflation minimises the erosion of debt over the years. People (and governments) with borrowing, such as mortgages, don't see the benefit. That big loan you have doesn't look so big if wages are keeping up with inflation. So-called deflation actually increases the value the debts.But low inflation discourages employers from raising pay (which hits the Treasury's tax take) and may even encourage them to cut pay in troubled times. And if prices are falling, consumers can put off big ticket purchases in the hope the fall will continue - and this slows economic growth.Savers are also penalised. Low inflation generally means lower official interest rates - and that means banks and building societies keep their savings rates down.It's why, when inflation remains one percentage point below 2%, the governor of the Bank of England writes to the chancellor to explain how the price index can be brought back on target. There's a good reason a little inflation is good for the economy.Most economists had expected April's inflation to fall to 0.9%, and have predicted the rate will fall further as the economic fallout of the pandemic continues. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation had taken a ""big leap towards zero by the summer"" as he said retailers were planning ""further large price cuts"".He predicted inflation would recover next year but was likely to remain below 2% for much of 2021.""The inflation outlook, then, supports the [Bank of England's] Monetary Policy Committee doing more to stimulate the economy at its next meeting in mid-June - we look for a further £100bn of quantitative easing to be announced,"" he added.Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, held broadly steady at an annual rate of 1.5%.Inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) - an older measure of inflation which the ONS says is inaccurate, but is widely used in bond markets and for other commercial contracts - dropped to 1.5% from 2.6%.",20 May 2020,business
"Coronavirus: Shopping may never be the same, says M&S","Customers ""may never shop the same way again"" after the coronavirus crisis, Marks and Spencer's boss has said.""Whilst some customer habits will return to normal, others have changed forever,"" Steve Rowe said.The pandemic has driven changes, including a shift to online and changing how customers use High Street stores that remain open, he added.Consumers are buying more herbs and whole vegetables as they cook from scratch at home under lockdown.The retailer has also found that as shoppers are visiting the shops less, they are planning what to eat further in advance. It said that customers are buying bigger product packs, such as of strawberries or chicken. Sales of frozen items are also up by 75% on the year in the UK.Soft T-shirt bras and bathroom products have seen increased sales on its website, while it is barely selling any suits or ties. M&S added that online shoppers were now browsing earlier in the day, between 15:00 and 17:00. As more customers work from home, desktop visits were also up 38% in comparison with the same period last year. But M&S is one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service.This has hampered the chain as customers have needed to purchase items online during lockdown if they are self-isolating, for example.The firm said last year that it had purchased a 50% share of online supermarket Ocado's retail business for £750m.The retailer will go into partnership with Ocado from September this year, replacing the online grocer's existing deal with Waitrose.M&S announced on Wednesday that more than 1,000 non-food items would also be available for delivery via its tie-up with Ocado. Customers will soon be able to buy cushions or underwear alongside their eggs or bread.Mr Rowe said that Ocado's strong performance during lockdown ""further reinforced"" the value of the deal for delivering groceries.The impact of the virus lockdown has driven ""effects and aftershocks"" in the retail sector that would ""endure for the coming year and beyond,"" Mr Rowe added.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: ""Covid-19 has accelerated lots of consumer trends and it may just be the catalyst required to accelerate Marks and Spencer's transformation into a 21st century retailer. ""In particular it looks as though M&S has learnt just how important online is - so it's making its Ocado venture more central to the business.""M&S was already undergoing a transformation plan led by its chief executive Steve Rowe which included cutting costs and closing some stores.The firm said that due to the pandemic, those measures would be sped up under a programme called ""Never The Same Again"".Those include buying clothing from fewer core suppliers, reducing the clothing and home ranges, as well as ""the replacement of ageing stores"".""The trauma of the Covid-19 crisis has galvanised our colleagues to secure the future of the business,"" said Mr Rowe.The company has been facing increasing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet in recent years.In the year to March, M&S said its clothing sales fell by 6.2%, whereas its food sales were up 1.9%.To add to its problems, M&S's non-food stores have been forced to shut under the lockdown measures.As a result, it faces a ""mounting backlog of unsold stock"" in its warehouses, it said. Clothing and homeware sales fell by 75% in the six weeks to 9 May. Food sales also fell, by 8.8%, although M&S said many of its Simply Food stores were trading strongly.The firm said that lockdown measures, social distancing and lower consumer demand were ""likely to continue through the year"", adding that the coronavirus pandemic means that its performance over the next year is difficult to predict.It is working on a scenario that assumes a sales hit of £2.1bn over the next year across clothing, home, food and international sales.Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Overall, M&S was facing challenges before coronavirus and these have simply been exacerbated. ""Within the difficulties there are real opportunities too, and the group appears to have a lot of the right ideas, but the next chapter really needs to be about execution."" Its comments came as M&S said its profits for the year to March had dropped by more than 20% to £403m, from £511m in the previous year, as its troubled clothing business continued to struggle.",20 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: World Bank warns 60m at risk of 'extreme poverty',"Up to 60m people will be pushed into ""extreme poverty"" by the coronavirus warns the president of the World Bank.David Malpass said the bank expects global economic growth to shrink by 5% this year as nations deal with the pandemic.This has already led to millions losing their jobs and businesses failing, with poorer countries feeling the brunt.""Millions of livelihoods have been destroyed and healthcare systems are under strain worldwide,"" he said.""Our estimate is that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty - that erases all the progress made in poverty alleviation in the past three years,"" Mr Malpass warned on Tuesday.The World Bank defines ""extreme poverty"" as living on less than $1.90 (£1.55) per person per day. The Washington-based lender is offering $160bn in grants and low-interest loans to help poor countries tackle the crisis. Mr Malpass said that 100 countries, home to 70% of the world's population, had already been granted emergency finance.""While the World Bank is providing sizeable resources, it won't be enough,"" he added.Mr Malpass said he was also frustrated with commercial lenders dragging their heels on offering debt relief to poor nations. ""I have been somewhat frustrated by the slow pace. Commercial creditors are still, by and large, taking payments from even the poorest countries and there needs to be faster movement.""The World Bank worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a scheme to allow poorer countries to request debt relief on repayments of loans owed to G20 members until the end of this year.At the same time, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan bank, said that the coronavirus pandemic must serve as a ""wake-up call"" to build a fairer society.""It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long,"" he wrote ahead of the bank's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.",20 May 2020,business
"Coronavirus: Rolls-Royce to cut 9,000 jobs amid virus crisis","Rolls-Royce has said it will cut 9,000 jobs and warned it will take ""several years"" for the airline industry to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.The Derby-based firm, which makes plane engines, said the reduction of nearly a fifth of its workforce would mainly affect its civil aerospace division.""This is not a crisis of our making. But it is the crisis that we face and must deal with,"" boss Warren East said.The bulk of the job cuts are expected to be in the UK at its site in Derby.Rolls-Royce employs 52,000 people globally and Mr East told the BBC's Today programme that the company had not yet concluded on ""exactly"" where the job losses would be, due to having to consult with unions.But he said: ""It's fair to say that of our civil aerospace business approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that's probably a good first proxy.""Roll-Royce's civil aerospace business has a number of sites in the UK, but the largest plant is in Derby.Unite the union said the decision was ""shameful opportunism"".""This company has accepted public money to furlough thousands of workers,"" said Unite's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner.""Unite and Britain's taxpayers deserve a more responsible approach to a national emergency.  We call upon Rolls-Royce to step back from the brink and work with us on a better way through this crisis.""Rolls-Royce initially furloughed 4,000 workers in the UK last month. Some 3,700 people remain on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme though which the government pays 80% of a worker's wage up to £2,500 a month.But Mr East said: ""No government can extend things like furlough schemes for years into the future. We have to look after ourselves and make sure we meet medium term demand.""This morning's job losses are hardly unexpected - airlines have cut their flying hours by 90% or more, and Airbus and Boeing have slashed their production numbers for the next few years - but they are still a heavy blow to one of the UK's few world-class manufacturing companies. While the details of where the cuts will fall have not been finalised, it is likely that two-thirds will go in the UK.The company has already used the government's furlough scheme to help pay the wages of about 4,000 staff, but Warren East, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, said companies could not expect the government to continue such a scheme for several years. There was also a clear hint this morning that some factories may close - the company said it would review its future manufacturing footprint.Some questions remain for Roll-Royce. Investors are scratching their head about when the company's revenues - much of which rely on aircraft to be flying for money to flow - will return.The company has not yet tapped its shareholders for more money - some expect that may eventually come.Air travel has ground to a virtual standstill since the coronavirus began spreading across the world and many airlines have announced steep job cuts.Global air traffic is expected to decline by 45% this year, according to investment bank Baird. It also forecasts that airlines are expected to lose $310bn (£253bn) in revenue in 2020.Rolls-Royce said the impact of the pandemic on the company and the whole of the aviation industry ""is unprecedented"".It added that it is ""increasingly clear that activity in the commercial aerospace market will take several years to return to the levels seen just a few months ago"". As well as the job losses, the company said it would cut costs in areas such as its plants and properties. It expects to make cost savings of £1.3bn.Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the aerospace industry association, said: ""The crisis is having a major impact on aerospace companies who provide high value, long-term jobs in all regions and nations of the UK, putting thousands more jobs at risk now and in the months ahead.""Do you work for Rolls-Royce?

Coronavirus: How will airlines get flying again?,"Aviation is the most global of global industries. It employs millions of people, underpins the livelihoods of tens of millions more, and acts as part of the central nervous system of international business and leisure.Yet now vast parts of the network have been shut down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of daily flights has fallen by 80% since the start of the year, and in some regions nearly all passenger traffic has been suspended.The industry is in survival mode, with airlines, airports and ground-handling firms all desperate to conserve their cash reserves, while their normal revenue streams have dried up.Widespread job losses are now expected, with British Airways' parent company IAG announcing on Tuesday that it is set to cut up to 12,000 positions from the airline's 42,000-strong workforce.  IAG said it did not expect BA to see passenger demand return to 2019 levels for ""several years"".Elsewhere, Easyjet has laid off its 4,000 UK-based cabin crew for two months, Qantas has put 20,000 staff on leave, and 700 pilots at American Airlines have agreed to take early retirement.Even so, attention is now gradually turning to the future, and how airlines around the world can hope to slowly return to something approaching normality.There are obvious logistical challenges. Aircraft need to be prepared for flight, and airports made ready to receive them. Schedules need to be drawn up, and staff made available. But there are also less predictable issues to contend with. No-one can be quite sure yet where aircraft will be allowed to fly to, or what conditions might be imposed on staff and passengers by national authorities.There are currently around 17,000 aircraft parked up at airports around the world, according to consultants Ascend by Cirium. That represents about two-thirds of the global fleet.BA, for example, has aeroplanes stored at London Heathrow, at its maintenance base in Cardiff, on taxiways at regional airports such as Bournemouth, and at Chateauroux airport in France.Even while parked, these aircraft require regular maintenance. Some will have been kept ready for immediate use. Many airlines have been carrying out repatriation flights, for example, or ad-hoc cargo services. But others will take a week or longer to prepare for flight, according to people within the industry. If all those aircraft were needed at once, getting them ready would be a formidable challenge. However, analysts say in practice this is unlikely to be the case - because most airlines will start off by operating relatively limited schedules, and many aircraft will not actually be needed for months to come. A further significant issue is the raft of human qualifications needed to allow the industry to function. Pilots, for example, need time in the air, or in the simulator, to maintain their ""ratings"", or permits to fly specific aircraft. They also need regular medical checks.  Other critical staff, such as air traffic control personnel and engineers, have time-limited qualifications as well. Although many airlines and airports are trying to ensure they still have a core of staff available with up-to-date certificates - those who are involved in dealing with repatriation and cargo flights, for example - others have been unable to continue working. In the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has already taken steps to prevent a backlog of expired credentials from undermining attempts to get planes back in the air as quickly as possible.  ""Due to the extraordinary current circumstances, an exemption has been put in place,"" a spokesperson said.""Where possible, we expect pilots to remain current through normal methods. If the exemption is being deployed, an airline must illustrate to us how this is being done safely.""Similar measures have been put in place for other key staff.But while there are clear logistical problems involved with getting thousands of aircraft back into service, and ensuring there are enough pilots and technicians to go around, these are not the main issues keeping aviation executives awake at night.The real problem, executives say, is the number of different countries that have introduced travel restrictions, and the lack of certainty over when those restrictions will be removed. ""What we are trying to do is have a global restart plan,"" explains Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association. ""The main challenge is how and when the different states will lift restrictions to travel.""He believes curbs on travel will clearly last beyond the middle of the year, and some may remain at least partially in force until the end of 2020.He thinks domestic routes within individual countries will open up first, followed by short-haul international services. Intercontinental travel would probably follow after that, although he admits ""that is a point we haven't resolved yet"".One area causing a great deal of uncertainty is the extent to which social distancing will be required when regular flying resumes. How will people be separated in airport lounges, in security queues, or in the airports themselves? What tests will be required, and how will they be carried out?This is a commercial issue for both airports and airlines. For example, retail outlets and restaurants provide a lucrative source of revenues for airport operators.""Non-aeronautical revenues are really important to airports,"" says Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association.""They enable us to keep down the charges we make to airlines, and ultimately that affects the ticket prices they can offer their customers.""We don't want to reconfigure everything in our airports, only to find out in six months' time there's a vaccine and the new measures aren't needed any more.""IATA's argument is that whatever measures are introduced need to be the same and implemented in a co-ordinated fashion. ""We need to avoid the kind of situation that followed 9/11,"" says Mr de Juniac. ""Back then we saw a piling up of different kinds of security measures, and it took a very long time to put it together again in a more consistent way. And we still have different measures.""Airlines too could be squeezed. Lufthansa is already operating services where middle seats are left unoccupied in order to allow a certain degree of social distancing on board. EasyJet - which has grounded its entire fleet - says it will do the same when it resumes flying.As a short-term measure, this might help passengers fly with a little more confidence. But it comes at a serious cost.In order to make money, airlines need as many seats as possible to be filled on every flight. ""Load factors"" are particularly important for budget carriers, which typically fly with more than 90% of seats occupied.But if middle seats are left unoccupied, aircraft will have to fly just 65% full.

If the exemption is being deployed, an airline must illustrate to us how this is being done safely.""Similar measures have been put in place for other key staff.But while there are clear logistical problems involved with getting thousands of aircraft back into service, and ensuring there are enough pilots and technicians to go around, these are not the main issues keeping aviation executives awake at night.The real problem, executives say, is the number of different countries that have introduced travel restrictions, and the lack of certainty over when those restrictions will be removed. ""What we are trying to do is have a global restart plan,"" explains Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association. ""The main challenge is how and when the different states will lift restrictions to travel.""He believes curbs on travel will clearly last beyond the middle of the year, and some may remain at least partially in force until the end of 2020.He thinks domestic routes within individual countries will open up first, followed by short-haul international services. Intercontinental travel would probably follow after that, although he admits ""that is a point we haven't resolved yet"".One area causing a great deal of uncertainty is the extent to which social distancing will be required when regular flying resumes. How will people be separated in airport lounges, in security queues, or in the airports themselves? What tests will be required, and how will they be carried out?This is a commercial issue for both airports and airlines. For example, retail outlets and restaurants provide a lucrative source of revenues for airport operators.""Non-aeronautical revenues are really important to airports,"" says Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association.""They enable us to keep down the charges we make to airlines, and ultimately that affects the ticket prices they can offer their customers.""We don't want to reconfigure everything in our airports, only to find out in six months' time there's a vaccine and the new measures aren't needed any more.""IATA's argument is that whatever measures are introduced need to be the same and implemented in a co-ordinated fashion. ""We need to avoid the kind of situation that followed 9/11,"" says Mr de Juniac. ""Back then we saw a piling up of different kinds of security measures, and it took a very long time to put it together again in a more consistent way. And we still have different measures.""Airlines too could be squeezed. Lufthansa is already operating services where middle seats are left unoccupied in order to allow a certain degree of social distancing on board. EasyJet - which has grounded its entire fleet - says it will do the same when it resumes flying.As a short-term measure, this might help passengers fly with a little more confidence. But it comes at a serious cost.In order to make money, airlines need as many seats as possible to be filled on every flight. ""Load factors"" are particularly important for budget carriers, which typically fly with more than 90% of seats occupied.But if middle seats are left unoccupied, aircraft will have to fly just 65% full.  This might be acceptable for a short period, but according to Mr De Juniac, if it went on for long, ""it would certainly change the way in which the industry operates"".Ryanair's CEO Michael O""Leary has put it more succinctly, describing the idea as ""idiotic"".In the UK the government is considering forcing all passengers arriving in the country to spend two weeks in quarantine.The industry association Airlines UK says such a plan would ""effectively kill international travel to and from the UK, and cause immeasurable damage to the aviation industry and wider UK economy"".More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Getting aircraft back in the air may prove to be the easy part. Finding people to fly in them could prove more difficult - and some long-term changes to the aviation market are highly likely.""It may not be too bad for firms which specialise in holiday travel,"" explains one tourism industry executive.""People still want to go on holiday, and there's definitely still interest in going to short-haul destinations later in the year."" But analysts say business travel could be a different matter. High-paying business and first class travellers usually account for a little under a third of the revenues for the industry as a whole. For long-haul carriers, it can be as much as 70%.But there are now serious threats to that traffic. The predicted global recession, the cancellation of major trade fairs and other set-piece events - and even the new willingness of businesses to use online tools as a substitute for face-to-face meetings - could all delay the recovery.""I think we'll see a fusing of business models, and airlines trying different things,"" says analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting.""So you could see a sort of business class-lite, where people get a business class seat and meals, but no access to lounges. So at least the seat is occupied. There's room for a lot of creative pricing.""But the biggest problem for the entire industry, as it prepares to get back in the air, is that no-one - at any level - can really be sure what its future looks like.

Ryanair says passenger numbers set to halve,"Ryanair has said it expects passenger numbers to halve in the current financial year as the coronavirus crisis continues to blight air travel.The airline said it expected numbers to fall below 80 million, down from its original target of 154 million.But it said it would weather the pandemic and emerge stronger.Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair still planned to ramp up flights in July and said UK government quarantine plans were ""idiotic"".The prediction of lower passenger numbers came as Ryanair announced profits of just over €1bn (£894m) for the financial year to the end of March.The airline's profit was 13% up on the previous year's figure of €885m.Ryanair is set to cut 3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce - as it restructures to cope with the coronavirus crisis.Chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC's Today programme that Ryanair still intended to restart large numbers of flights from July, despite government plans to introduce a 14-day quarantine for people arriving in the UK, including returning holidaymakers.Mr O'Leary repeated his criticism of the quarantine plan, saying: ""It's idiotic and it's un-implementable. You don't have enough police in the UK.""He said the policy had ""no credibility"" and predicted that it would be gone by June.Ryanair said 2021 would be a ""difficult"" year as it worked hard to return to scheduled flying. But it said its balance sheet was one of the strongest in the industry, with cash reserves of more than €4bn.""Unlike many flag carrier competitors, Ryanair will not request or receive state aid,"" it added.Ryanair said it could not provide any profit guidance for the current financial year, but it expected to report a loss of more than €200m in the April-to-June period.""As we look beyond the next year, there will be significant opportunities for Ryanair's low-cost growth model as competitors shrink, fail or are acquired by government bailed-out carriers,"" it said.",18 May 2020,business
J&J to still sell baby powder in UK despite US ban,"Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson says it will continue to sell its talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder in the UK and the rest of the world, despite stopping sales in the US and Canada.It said North American sales had shrunk partly because of a ""constant barrage"" of advertising by lawyers seeking clients to claim against the company.J&J has been at the centre of claims for years that its talc causes cancer.It has always strenuously defended the product's safety.Johnson & Johnson has been ordered to pay out billions of dollars in compensation, but has so far always successfully appealed against these verdicts.Almost 20,000 people in the US have so far lodged claims against the company.Talc is mined from the earth and is found in seams close to that of asbestos, a material known to cause cancer. The company said in a statement: ""Johnson & Johnson remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder.""It said ""decades"" of study by medical and legal experts around the world supported its view, and all verdicts against the company that had gone against it had been overturned on appeal. It will continue to sell its talc-based products in the US and Canada until stocks have sold out. It also sells a cornstarch-based powder which it will continue to sell in North America.It said both types of Johnson's baby powder, talc-based and cornstarch-based, will continue to be sold in other markets around the world where there is ""significantly higher"" consumer demand for the product.  The firm said changes in consumer behaviour had also dampened demand for the powder. The firm added that the move was also part of a reassessment of its consumer products prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.It said in October that its testing had found no asbestos in its baby powder after tests conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration discovered trace amounts.The firm is appealing against a 2018 order to pay $4.7bn (£3.6bn) in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc products caused them to develop ovarian cancer.",20 May 2020,business
Toy and vegetable costs rise as fuel price drops,"The UK's inflation rate fell in April to its lowest since August 2016 as the economic fallout of the first month of the lockdown hit prices.The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) fell to 0.8% from 1.5% in March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.Falling petrol and diesel prices, plus lower energy bills, were the main drivers pushing inflation lower.But the prices of games and toys rose, which the ONS said may be due to people spending more time at home. However, there were 92 items in the ONS's basket of goods and services that it could not measure in April because they were mostly unavailable. These ranged from haircut prices, lemonade, manicures, cinema popcorn, and leisure activities involving sport. The ONS said it would monitor the issue for any distortion in the overall picture. But Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""While the coronavirus limited the availability of some goods and services, its effect on prices was more muted.""He said that food prices generally rose no more quickly than other goods and services, ""though fresh vegetables did see stronger rises"".The ONS said average petrol prices dropped by 10.4p a litre between March and April - the biggest fall since unleaded petrol records began in 1990 - amid a slump in global oil prices. Energy prices also pushed inflation lower as regulator Ofgem reduced its default tariff cap.The ONS said clothes retailers, hit during the early days of the lockdown by weaker footfall and then the closure of outlets, resorted to more discount sales than usual to try to shift their stock.Goods seeing upward pressure on prices included video games and consoles, board games and children's toys, the ONS said. And the price of knitting wool rose, another sign of the crafts and hobbies popular with people staying at home.Long-life products - such as cook-in sauces and frozen fish - also saw price hikes last month as consumers stocked up for life in lockdown.Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, said it was likely that as shops start re-opening retailers would deeply discount prices, putting further downward pressure on inflation.She also pointed to positive news for savers. ""For the first time in ages [savers] can now get above inflation interest rates on easy-access savings accounts - from more than one account.""CPI is now far below the Bank of England's 2% target, used as general guidance to help businesses set the right prices and for people to plan their spending.But while low inflation reduces the need for rises in interest rates and gives people a feeling the pound in their pocket stretches further, it's possible to have too much of a good thing. Low inflation minimises the erosion of debt over the years. People (and governments) with borrowing, such as mortgages, don't see the benefit. That big loan you have doesn't look so big if wages are keeping up with inflation. So-called deflation actually increases the value the debts.But low inflation discourages employers from raising pay (which hits the Treasury's tax take) and may even encourage them to cut pay in troubled times. And if prices are falling, consumers can put off big ticket purchases in the hope the fall will continue - and this slows economic growth.Savers are also penalised. Low inflation generally means lower official interest rates - and that means banks and building societies keep their savings rates down.It's why, when inflation remains one percentage point below 2%, the governor of the Bank of England writes to the chancellor to explain how the price index can be brought back on target. There's a good reason a little inflation is good for the economy.Most economists had expected April's inflation to fall to 0.9%, and have predicted the rate will fall further as the economic fallout of the pandemic continues. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation had taken a ""big leap towards zero by the summer"" as he said retailers were planning ""further large price cuts"".He predicted inflation would recover next year but was likely to remain below 2% for much of 2021.""The inflation outlook, then, supports the [Bank of England's] Monetary Policy Committee doing more to stimulate the economy at its next meeting in mid-June - we look for a further £100bn of quantitative easing to be announced,"" he added.Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, held broadly steady at an annual rate of 1.5%.Inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index (RPI) - an older measure of inflation which the ONS says is inaccurate, but is widely used in bond markets and for other commercial contracts - dropped to 1.5% from 2.6%.",20 May 2020,business
"Coronavirus: Shopping may never be the same, says M&S","Customers ""may never shop the same way again"" after the coronavirus crisis, Marks and Spencer's boss has said.""Whilst some customer habits will return to normal, others have changed forever,"" Steve Rowe said.The pandemic has driven changes, including a shift to online and changing how customers use High Street stores that remain open, he added.Consumers are buying more herbs and whole vegetables as they cook from scratch at home under lockdown.The retailer has also found that as shoppers are visiting the shops less, they are planning what to eat further in advance. It said that customers are buying bigger product packs, such as of strawberries or chicken. Sales of frozen items are also up by 75% on the year in the UK.Soft T-shirt bras and bathroom products have seen increased sales on its website, while it is barely selling any suits or ties. M&S added that online shoppers were now browsing earlier in the day, between 15:00 and 17:00. As more customers work from home, desktop visits were also up 38% in comparison with the same period last year. But M&S is one of the few big food retailers without its own internet-based delivery service.This has hampered the chain as customers have needed to purchase items online during lockdown if they are self-isolating, for example.The firm said last year that it had purchased a 50% share of online supermarket Ocado's retail business for £750m.The retailer will go into partnership with Ocado from September this year, replacing the online grocer's existing deal with Waitrose.M&S announced on Wednesday that more than 1,000 non-food items would also be available for delivery via its tie-up with Ocado. Customers will soon be able to buy cushions or underwear alongside their eggs or bread.Mr Rowe said that Ocado's strong performance during lockdown ""further reinforced"" the value of the deal for delivering groceries.The impact of the virus lockdown has driven ""effects and aftershocks"" in the retail sector that would ""endure for the coming year and beyond,"" Mr Rowe added.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: ""Covid-19 has accelerated lots of consumer trends and it may just be the catalyst required to accelerate Marks and Spencer's transformation into a 21st century retailer. ""In particular it looks as though M&S has learnt just how important online is - so it's making its Ocado venture more central to the business.""M&S was already undergoing a transformation plan led by its chief executive Steve Rowe which included cutting costs and closing some stores.The firm said that due to the pandemic, those measures would be sped up under a programme called ""Never The Same Again"".Those include buying clothing from fewer core suppliers, reducing the clothing and home ranges, as well as ""the replacement of ageing stores"".""The trauma of the Covid-19 crisis has galvanised our colleagues to secure the future of the business,"" said Mr Rowe.The company has been facing increasing competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos on the internet in recent years.In the year to March, M&S said its clothing sales fell by 6.2%, whereas its food sales were up 1.9%.To add to its problems, M&S's non-food stores have been forced to shut under the lockdown measures.As a result, it faces a ""mounting backlog of unsold stock"" in its warehouses, it said. Clothing and homeware sales fell by 75% in the six weeks to 9 May. Food sales also fell, by 8.8%, although M&S said many of its Simply Food stores were trading strongly.The firm said that lockdown measures, social distancing and lower consumer demand were ""likely to continue through the year"", adding that the coronavirus pandemic means that its performance over the next year is difficult to predict.It is working on a scenario that assumes a sales hit of £2.1bn over the next year across clothing, home, food and international sales.Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Overall, M&S was facing challenges before coronavirus and these have simply been exacerbated. ""Within the difficulties there are real opportunities too, and the group appears to have a lot of the right ideas, but the next chapter really needs to be about execution.""

Coronavirus: UK tourism boss backs call for 'air bridges',"The boss of the UK's national tourism agency has thrown her weight behind setting up so-called air bridges with countries with low coronavirus rates.Visit Britain chief executive Patricia Yates told MPs it was an ""interesting"" idea and indicated the US could be open to agreeing a deal.Air bridges would allow visitors from low-risk countries into the UK without having to quarantine for 14 days.A government spokesperson said air bridges were ""not an agreed policy."" He said: ""Work on this is continuing... ultimately we will be guided by the science and the health of the public must come first.""  Transport secretary Grant Shapps suggested on Monday that the government's plan to quarantine people arriving in the UK for two weeks could include exceptions. He said: ""We should indeed consider further improvements, for example, things like air bridges enabling people from other countries who have themselves achieved lower levels of coronavirus infection to come to the country,"" Ms Yates told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee that the US may be interested in reopening travel links with the UK.""Our American regional director is telling us sort of America is ready to go, American business is ready to go. So, possibly, an air bridge between the UK and America might be one that would be valuable to us.""She added that other valuable markets for mutual arrangements also include France, Germany and Italy.Airlines have objected to the government's 14 day quarantine plan which they say will put people off from travelling. Mr Shapps said the quarantine measure, which is set to ""come in early next month"", would initially be a ""blanket situation"". But he said the government was in ""active discussions"" about other options.Number 10 said the two week quarantine measure would be reviewed every three weeks once it is introduced.But Airlines UK, which represents the industry, said reviews need to be done on a more regular basis.""If the government does insist on doing this, with minimal exemptions in place, we need strict rolling reviews to be enforced so that this policy is not in place a second longer than it needs to be,"" it said.",19 May 2020,business
Dark web scammers exploit Covid-19 fear and doubt,"""They're exploiting the fear, uncertainty and doubt people are experiencing during the pandemic, and using the anxiety and desperation to get people to buy things or click on things they wouldn't have otherwise,"" says Morgan Wright, a former senior adviser to the US Department of State anti-terrorism assistance programme.He's talking about the scammers and criminals that inhabit the ""dark web"" who have found a new angle - anxiety over Covid-19.Mr Wright, who is now chief security adviser at security software company SentinelOne, used to teach behavioural analysts at the US National Security Agency (NSA) about the exploitation of human behaviour. He is now seeing some of those techniques being used on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet that can be accessed using popular networks such as Tor.The Tor browser is privacy-focused, meaning it can obscure who is using it and what data is being accessed. It offers bad actors a way to operate with a degree of impunity, as law enforcement find it much more difficult to track down criminals that use it.Tor is a way to access the internet that requires software, known as the Tor browser, to use it.The name is an acronym for The Onion Router. Just as there are many layers to the vegetable, there are many layers of encryption on the network.It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and continues to receive funding from the US State Department.It attempts to hide a person's location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several ""nodes"" - which, in this context, means using volunteers' PCs and computer servers as connection points.Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity.To the website that ultimately receives the request, it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain - known as an ""exit node"" - rather than the person responsible.Since the beginning of the global pandemic, marketplaces on the dark web have seen a rise in Covid-19 related products and services. Sought-after N95 masks, gowns, gloves and the drug chloroquine have all been listed on these marketplaces. Last month, security software firm IntSights found blood allegedly belonging to recovered coronavirus patients was even being offered for sale. Criminals hope a heightened sense of fear will make people rush to buy these products, and as a result these items are not cheap; an Australian Institute of Criminology report found the average fake vaccine was being sold for about $370 (£300), while one supposedly sourced from China was selling for between $10-15,000 (£8-12,000).One of the reasons for the rise in such sales may be because many fraudsters are having to turn from their normal methods of making money on the dark web - such as selling fake flights booked using stolen airmiles - because these industries are currently dormant. Many criminals also see an opportunity - as the majority of people are working from home, there is a greater chance of lax cyber security in place. ""There was suddenly a huge shift [on the dark web] of talking about vulnerabilities in collaboration software when they realised people were going to be working from home,"" says IntSights chief security officer Etay Maor. More Technology of BusinessPhishing scams have also been on the rise. These are where fraudsters pretend to be a different organisation or person by email, hoping the person will provide some login details or personal data, which can then be used to steal money or someone's identity. ""The phishing attacks started with those pretending to be from the NHS, and then extended to secondary organisations that are related to Covid-19 like banks or HMRC emailing about funding, grants or being furloughed,"" says Javvad Malik, security advocate at training company KnowBe4.""Now there are Covid-19 related phishing templates making their way into all of the phishing kits that are available on the dark web - meaning people can imitate Apple or LinkedIn with a set of standard templates,"" he adds.In addition, many services and products, including phishing kits are being offered at discount in ""coronavirus sales"".""There are people who have been specialising in phishing pages, shady VPNs or spamming services for a number of years, who are now offering discounts because they believe it's the best time to make money and spread these kits,"" says Liv Rowley, threat intelligence analyst at Blueliv, a computer and network security firm.The dark web was designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, with the idea of enabling human rights activists and people within the military to talk and collaborate in a secure, anonymous way. While the introduction of bitcoin enabled criminals to make money on the dark web, there remains a huge number of users that opt to use it for its initial purpose - speaking to others anonymously on forums.According to Mr Malik, these forums have often been used to fuel conspiracy theories around the virus.""Conspiracies about 5G being the vehicle of this virus, or bioweaponry or that Bill Gates is the man behind it tend to crop up on the dark web,"" he says.As social media companies and other news outlets crack down on misinformation, many others may be pushed onto the dark web. These forums often act as a gateway to marketplaces, for people to plug their products or services to a targeted audience. This could be a way for fraudsters to make further money in the months to come. The flipside to this is that many journalists, activists and citizens may be using the dark web to communicate in countries where there is a lot of censorship. Tor versions of many news outlets, including the BBC and New York Times, may be used if the original sites are blocked by governments or states, for instance. Netblocks, a digital rights advocacy group says that many countries have cut access to the web in different ways, as they seek to control the flow of information about the coronavirus outbreak.Two ransomware groups had said they would not attack any hospitals or healthcare organisations during the pandemic, but as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab outlined in a recent press briefing, there is evidence that criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations that are responding to the pandemic - including hospitals.""These organisations are targeted because of how vulnerable they are at this time and because of the likelihood that a ransom would be paid,"" says Charity Wright, cyber threat intelligence adviser at IntSights.The co-ordination and orchestration of many of these attacks often begin on the dark web.""We are seeing more offerings on the dark web specifically for healthcare-related information and for targeting healthcare facilities and doctors. There's even a database someone has created on the dark web with all kinds of information about medical staff,"" says Etay Maor from IntSights. At its core, the dark web may still be being used for the same reasons it was intended to be used for - from a privacy and security perspective. But criminals are using this to try to exploit a global crisis for financial gain.""That's the double-edged sword that as a society we haven't quite worked out: how do we safeguard freedom of speech and ensure privacy, but at the same time track down and stop people abusing those freedoms?"" says Javvad Malik.

"The man who bought 60,000 oil and gas wells","The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Rusty Hutson Jr, founder and chief executive of US energy firm Diversified Gas & Oil (DGO).In the end, Rusty Hutson Jr couldn't escape the calling of the family trade.Born and raised in a blue-collar household in the oil and gas fields of West Virginia, his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all earned their livings in the energy sector.They worked at the wells, and on the pipelines, putting in a hard shift of manual labour, day after day, year after year, to provide for their families.During his summer holidays from high school and then college, Rusty would go to work with his dad.But when he became the first Hutson to graduate from university, in 1991, he decided he wanted to do something completely different with his life.""I decided that going into oil and gas was about the last thing I wanted to do,"" he says. ""I didn't want a part of it when I got out. It's really hard work.""So armed with an accountancy degree from West Virginia's Fairmont State University he went off to have a successful banking career for the next decade, ending up in Birmingham, Alabama.But as the years progressed, Rusty says it started to nag at him that he hadn't followed his dad into the family industry.""West Virginia was a tough state when I was growing up. Still is,"" he says. ""And there were two kinds of people - you either worked in coal, or you worked in oil and gas. It was a generational thing - if your dad and grandfather did it for a living, then you did it.""And as the years progressed I increasingly felt drawn back to that world. I also had this desire to build something, to do something entrepreneurial.""So in 2001, aged 32, Rusty bought an old gas well back in West Virginia for $250,000 (£200,000). He raised the money by remortgaging his home.""It was a small old well, it had been in production for years, but it was like gold to me,"" he says. ""I spent the next four years still also working in the bank, but any spare time I had I'd fly up to West Virginia to work alongside the one well tender that I had back then.""Fast-forward to today, and Rusty's company, DGO, now owns more than 60,000 gas and oil wells across West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, a region called the Appalachia. Employing 925 people it has annual revenues of more than $500m. Some 90% of its operation is natural gas, with 10% oil.The company's business model is a very specific one - it doesn't do any drilling to find new oil and gas reserves. Instead it buys up old oil and gas wells that bigger producers no longer want, because the initial large flow levels have fallen to low volumes.""They don't want these old wells, but the average remaining life on most of these wells is 50 years,"" he says. ""So we can come in, run them very efficiently, and make money.""Rusty says that DGO has been greatly helped by the so-called ""dash for shale"" in the US over the past decade, whereby oil and gas firms gave up traditional oil and gas wells to switch to fracking instead.In very simple terms, unlike traditional wells where oil and gas is sucked up, fracking involves first injecting a high pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals into shale rock. This fractures the rock, and allows the removal of vast quantities of oil and gas that wasn't previously accessible.Rusty says the industry-wide move to fracking, and its higher production volumes, meant that DGO has been able to buy thousands of old, but still productive, traditional wells cheaply, and rapidly expand the business.To help raise funds for continuing expansion, in 2017 the company decided to go public and sell its shares on a stock exchange. In an unusual move for a US firm, Rusty chose the London Stock Exchange's (LSE's) Alternative Investment Market.""We weren't big enough at the time to float in the US,"" he says. ""And I didn't want to go down the private equity route because I didn't want to work for somebody else, and try to earn back some of the percentage.""More The Boss features:DGO is now in the process of moving up to the Main Market of the LSE.Energy sector analyst James McCormack of Cenkos Securities says that DGO's strategy of ""acquiring low-cost, long-life, low-decline [oil and gas] production"" is ""a virtually unique proposition"". He adds: ""Under Rusty's leadership, DGO has grown rapidly since its IPO (initial public offering) in February 2017, increasing production 20 times and reserves 23 times.""Fellow energy analyst Carlos Gomes of Edison says that DGO is now the largest conventional gas producer in the Appalachia region. ""The company possesses long-life, low operational cost, mature producing assets that generate very stable cash flows,"" he adds.The long-term plan at DGO is to keep buying wells to replace any that eventually come to the end of production, and Rusty says the firm is now looking to expand into other regions, such as down in Texas.In the more immediate term, he says that he is relaxed about the big falls in oil and gas prices since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, both because he has long-term ""hedges"" or agreements in place on what price he sells his production for, and because his business operates more efficiently than its larger rivals.He can also turn to his dad for help and advice. His father, Rusty Sr, is the supervisor for the company's northern West Virginia operation.""He's 72 and he just absolutely loves it,"" says Rusty. ""Does he try to tell me what to do? Oh, absolutely.""",18 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: The couples for whom love doesn't wait,"The coronavirus outbreak may have scuppered many wedding plans, but plenty of couples are still getting engaged. For many, lockdown has been both a bonding experience and a chance to get creative with proposals.James French, 33, had originally planned a blockbuster marriage proposal. He was going to pop the question to his partner of six years, Becky Firth, during the holiday of a lifetime to Japan. He pictured it happening amongst the blossom.Coronavirus put a stop to that. The holiday was cancelled.However, the couple managed in March to complete their planned move from London back to the north of England where they had both grown up. They had planned to stay with their parents in Saltaire, near Bradford, while they looked for a new home. But since both sets of parents are vulnerable, the couple had to move in with friends instead.James, a product consultant for a technology firm, decided to improvise his proposal plans in these far from ideal circumstances.“I set up a treasure hunt in the village where she grew up with riddles and poems in meaningful places,” he explains. Since he did it on her 30th birthday, she didn’t necessarily suspect what was to come. The final clue led to a spot on the moors, where he asked the big question. She said yes.The tricky thing from a practical point of view was the ring, explains James. He wasn’t sure he wanted to buy an expensive diamond one online and have it arrive by post, but of course he couldn’t go to a shop because of lockdown.In the end, he decided to buy a ring online that he would use just for the proposal. He knew it still had to look good, and similar to the real one he would eventually get so that they could show if off in engagement photos, he says. The couple plan to wait until 2022 to get married, because they know there will be huge pressure to hold postponed weddings next year.This is something we can celebrate now, and cherish, despite coronavirus, says James.In Northamptonshire, Marilyn Coles, 24, and Roland Walet, 26, were also in lockdown.They met on Tinder last year and have been living together for just over six months.They hadn’t been thinking about marriage before, but coronavirus focused their minds.“Lockdown is a stressful situation and it’s brought us closer together,” says Roland. “Spending more time together has bonded us, we can see every side of each other.”It allowed Roland to get to know Marilyn’s son from a previous relationship properly, he adds.“Suddenly I could see myself spending the rest of my life with Marilyn.”Marilyn remembers the day of the proposal well.“The doorbell rings and he went a bit giddy as he went down the stairs, bless him.”“I suspected it was the ring at last,” explains Roland. He had got one customised online.After a quick inspection to make sure it was what he expected inside the envelope, he braced himself and returned upstairs to propose in the bedroom.The prospect of big ceremonies and occasions, says Marilyn, makes her feel anxious, so this was just the kind of proposal she wanted.Roland is a Dutch national and the couple plan to marry next year in Amsterdam in an informal ceremony with friends.“Love doesn’t wait,” says Tobias Kormind, head of jewellers 77 Diamonds, with a wry smile. It specialises in selling diamond rings online and ships more than 10,000 each year.He anticipated “a massive drop in demand” as a result of coronavirus, up to 80% of sales perhaps, he says.In fact, so far his company has seen a sales drop of only around a quarter.Normally he sells 60% of rings online and the rest in physical stores, but online sales have risen since lockdown, helping to stabilise the business.“Many customers have told us that even though they can no longer travel to a special proposal location, they don’t want to wait and are proposing at home instead in very thoughtful and imaginative ways,” says Kormind.“If someone feels the time is right to propose, then it’s right. The setting is only really window dressing. In times of crisis you get to know people a lot better, a lot quicker.“With lockdown, it’s like you actually have the government pushing love,” he jokes.Hamish Shephard, founder of wedding planning platform Bridebook, has spotted a similar trend.“We thought our business would grind to a halt when coronavirus struck,” he says.Bridebook has handled more than 170,000 weddings since starting in 2015.In fact new sign-ups to his service this April only dropped slightly compared with the previous year, by around 5%.The feedback from customers is that despite unprecedented financial pressures, and the inability to hold wedding ceremonies, couples still want to get engaged, says Shephard.He too puts it down to couples spending more time together.Ones who are furloughed are getting the chance to share hobbies and learn about each other’s interests, outside of the usual grind of work, he says.He predicts that 2021 and 2022 will be bumper years for the wedding business. One of 77 Diamond’s recent customers is police officer Daniel Hughes-McConnell, 30. He originally had grand plans for a proposal in New York.He was well aware that his long-term girlfriend, nurse Emily Hands, also 30, had dreamed of it happening next to the Rockefeller Plaza Christmas tree. She’d had the idea since watching the film Home Alone as a little girl.He made the necessary arrangements, but the dream was quashed when travel firm Thomas Cook collapsed.Daniel then planned to propose on a trip to Italy. When coronavirus forced him to cancel their travel plans again, he thought he was cursed.Like James, he decided to adapt his plans to the new reality of lockdown, rather than delay.He admits to being a little apprehensive about getting the ring in the post. It was sent first class and recorded delivery. But he ended up getting in a panic because he forgot there was a bank holiday coming, which delayed its arrival by a day (Emily’s face winces in disbelief during our video call as he apparently shares this detail for the first time).Daniel proposed on a beach near where the couple live in Prestatyn in North Wales, a place they used to take romantic walks together when they first starting going out.He chose a spot to go down on one knee with extra significance for Emily - a bench commemorating her best friend from school, who died a few years ago.Emily was touched by the gesture and is glad the couple didn’t postpone the engagement, waiting for a grander and more expensive proposal abroad.“In fact, the cheaper proposal has been a blessing in disguise,” says Daniel.“The money we saved by not going to New York or Rome, will be spent on our first baby, who we are expecting in November.” If you have an inspiring personal story about being in lockdown, contact reporter Dougal Shaw",17 May 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

J&J to still sell baby powder in UK despite US ban,"Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson says it will continue to sell its talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder in the UK and the rest of the world, despite stopping sales in the US and Canada.It said North American sales had shrunk partly because of a ""constant barrage"" of advertising by lawyers seeking clients to claim against the company.J&J has been at the centre of claims for years that its talc causes cancer.It has always strenuously defended the product's safety.Johnson & Johnson has been ordered to pay out billions of dollars in compensation, but has so far always successfully appealed against these verdicts.Almost 20,000 people in the US have so far lodged claims against the company.Talc is mined from the earth and is found in seams close to that of asbestos, a material known to cause cancer. The company said in a statement: ""Johnson & Johnson remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder.""It said ""decades"" of study by medical and legal experts around the world supported its view, and all verdicts against the company that had gone against it had been overturned on appeal. It will continue to sell its talc-based products in the US and Canada until stocks have sold out. It also sells a cornstarch-based powder which it will continue to sell in North America.It said both types of Johnson's baby powder, talc-based and cornstarch-based, will continue to be sold in other markets around the world where there is ""significantly higher"" consumer demand for the product.  The firm said changes in consumer behaviour had also dampened demand for the powder. The firm added that the move was also part of a reassessment of its consumer products prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.It said in October that its testing had found no asbestos in its baby powder after tests conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration discovered trace amounts.The firm is appealing against a 2018 order to pay $4.7bn (£3.6bn) in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc products caused them to develop ovarian cancer.",20 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: World Bank warns 60m at risk of 'extreme poverty',"Up to 60m people will be pushed into ""extreme poverty"" by the coronavirus warns the president of the World Bank.David Malpass said the bank expects global economic growth to shrink by 5% this year as nations deal with the pandemic.This has already led to millions losing their jobs and businesses failing, with poorer countries feeling the brunt.""Millions of livelihoods have been destroyed and healthcare systems are under strain worldwide,"" he said.""Our estimate is that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty - that erases all the progress made in poverty alleviation in the past three years,"" Mr Malpass warned on Tuesday.The World Bank defines ""extreme poverty"" as living on less than $1.90 (£1.55) per person per day. The Washington-based lender is offering $160bn in grants and low-interest loans to help poor countries tackle the crisis. Mr Malpass said that 100 countries, home to 70% of the world's population, had already been granted emergency finance.""While the World Bank is providing sizeable resources, it won't be enough,"" he added.Mr Malpass said he was also frustrated with commercial lenders dragging their heels on offering debt relief to poor nations. ""I have been somewhat frustrated by the slow pace. Commercial creditors are still, by and large, taking payments from even the poorest countries and there needs to be faster movement.""The World Bank worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a scheme to allow poorer countries to request debt relief on repayments of loans owed to G20 members until the end of this year.At the same time, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan bank, said that the coronavirus pandemic must serve as a ""wake-up call"" to build a fairer society.""It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long,"" he wrote ahead of the bank's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.",20 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Concerns over 'out of pocket' rail passengers,"Some rail passengers have been waiting eight weeks for a season ticket refund and are not clear on when they will get the money, a lobby group has said.Passengers were promised refunds at the start of the coronavirus lockdown to encourage them to stay at home.Transport Focus said some were still waiting for refunds of several hundreds of pounds.Rail companies said they had processed more season ticket refunds than in the whole of last year.In late March, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government would ""ensure no-one is unfairly out of pocket for doing the right thing"" when he said refunds would be granted to those staying at home.In a survey of 700 passengers last week, Transport Focus said a third of those asked had not yet received a refund, and six in 10 had not been kept informed over how long it would take.They included one passenger who said he had no idea of the progress of his claim for a £3,000 refund, and another who said he had been waiting for eight weeks for £720 to be returned.Anthony Smith, chief executive of the watchdog, said: “While the majority of passengers have received a refund, six weeks on from applying others are still out of pocket and in the dark.”In normal times, rail companies generally promise to pay within 28 days.Transport Focus said many people would be hit hard financially by the coronavirus outbreak and so needed clarity over when any money would be back in their bank account.Jacqueline Starr, chief operating officer for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said the number of refund claims was “unprecedented”. “In the last two months over 109,000 season tickets have been refunded, which is more than the entirety of last year,"" she said.“We thank people for their patience as refunds are processed during these exceptional times and we have doubled the number of staff processing refund claims.”In total, train companies had given 2.8 million refunds on all types of rail tickets, worth more than £247m, in two months.Customers can apply for 56 days, double the normal period, and season ticket refunds are being backdated.",20 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Big sales expected when clothes stores reopen next month,"Clothes shops are ramping up plans to reopen with potentially big discounts.In England, some non-essential retailers will be able to begin reopening next month.One of the UK's biggest fashion retailers, Marks and Spencer, said: ""We are working towards reopening more space from June."" But analyst Richard Lim of Retail Economics said stores ""will have to discount heavily"" to sell excess stock that may now be out of season.""Many clothing retailers have been sitting there with stores full of stock which they haven't be able to shift,"" he said.""One of the most pressing issues for retailers is working capital and there is a huge overhang of inventory at fashion stores.""Fashion retailers have been badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Even those with robust online offerings have reported huge drops in sales.Next, for instance, saw online sales decline by 32% in the three months to the end of April. Like others, it is keen to re-open stores, as soon as it is deemed safe to do so.Next said: ""We have plans in place for the re-purposing of our stores ready to reopen in a socially-distanced world.""Its measures include installing screens at tills, placing sanitisation stations in stores and managing the number of customers that are allowed to enter its shops.M&S has kept its food stores open during the crisis, including almost 300 shops that sell fashion as well, although these areas have been blocked off.But it says they're ready to be reopened as soon as the government gives it the green light.""Our 290 stores that sell both clothing and food are led by a single manager - so it means they already have a brilliant working knowledge of the necessary hygiene measures, how to manage social distancing and the flow of our customers in and out of their store,"" M&S said.Last week the government said its strategy was to ""open non-essential retail when and where it is safe to do so"", and subject to those retailers being able to follow new guidelines.It said the intention was for this to happen in phases from 1 June, although it added that it would issue further guidance on which businesses will be allowed to open and when.That guidance can't come soon enough, according to Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC).""Retailers desperately need clarity in the rules regarding when and how they can open - details that are still lacking,"" she said.She warned that safety must be the primary concern in the decisions, rather than size or type of shop. The retail experience is going to be turned on its head when clothes stores reopen,"" predicted Mr Lim from Retail Economics.""Retailers are having to reinterpret government guidelines and have to invest heavily to make sure they can create a safe environment.""He said consumers will remain incredibly anxious and cautious about returning to fashion retailers.Changing rooms are expected to remain closed while customers will be encouraged to avoid touching merchandise.""Staff will potentially have to walk around spraying shelves,"" Mr Lim said.There are likely to be one-way systems through stores with clear floor markings and signage, while customer entry will be limited and consumers will be encouraged to shop alone.Next said it will ""prioritise the opening of our larger out-of-town stores first"".Their bigger size makes them easier to adapt and they have large car parks and outside spaces to manage queues, it said.""Retailers have started to plan how they can open stores and follow safety guidelines, with some hinting at sales when they do open their doors, such as Next,"" said Dan Plant, savings expert at UKHotDeals.""Other popular stores, like Primark, lack online sales space, so we'd expect to see plenty of fashion offers when retailers reopen.""But while fashion stores may reopen with deep discounts to clear old stock, most online retailers have already been offering sales to encourage shoppers.M&S, for instance, launched its ""rainbow sale"" on Friday with up to 50% off and 10% of takings going to NHS charities.Boohoo, Fat Face, French Connection, Gap, JD Sports , Next, Superdry and Topshop have offered similar 50%-off deals.The likes of Asos, Clarks, Dune, Debenhams, John Lewis, Karen Millen, New Look, Office and Quiz have also been offering cut-price deals.
