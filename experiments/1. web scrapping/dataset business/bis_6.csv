Coronavirus: Uber announces drastic cuts to secure its future,"Uber has announced a drastic action plan to scale back its business as its losses balloon amid pandemic lockdowns.The firm said it would cut 3,000 more jobs, bringing the total reductions in recent weeks to a quarter of the workforce.It is also closing or consolidating more than 40 offices and winding down units such as its artificial intelligence lab.The head of the firm said the moves were necessary ""to secure our future"".""We must establish ourselves as a self-sustaining enterprise that no longer relies on new capital or investors to keep growing, expanding and innovating,"" chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi wrote in a letter to staff.""We have to take these hard actions to stand strong on our own two feet, to secure our future and to continue on our mission.""Even before the pandemic, Uber was grappling with huge losses. But its challenges have multiplied as activity plunges during the pandemic.The number of Uber rides dropped 80% last month at the height of the lockdowns in the US and Canada. Meanwhile, although its Uber Eats food delivery business has surged, it remains loss-making.Earlier this month, Uber announced it would cut 3,700 staff and warned of possible additional reductions. The workforce cuts do not include drivers, whom Uber considers independent contractors.The affected offices include hubs in San Francisco and in Singapore, which will start closing over the next year as the firm selects a new regional headquarters.Uber said it would reorganise its remaining staff and cut back spending in areas that are not part of its core personal transport or food delivery businesses, including its AI Labs.Combined, the actions should reduce spending by $1bn, the company said.Uber's actions are the latest sign of the ongoing economic impact of the virus and efforts to control it. While some places have started to ease restrictions, many companies - especially those in the travel industry - have warned it will take time for public confidence in the safety of many everyday activities to be restored.Uber's smaller rival, Lyft, has also announced significant job cuts, as have airlines, hoteliers and booking platforms such as Airbnb.""Given the dramatic impact of the pandemic, and the unpredictable nature of any eventual recovery, we are concentrating our efforts on our core mobility and delivery platforms and resizing our company to match the realities of our business,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said.",18 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Uber tells all drivers to wear face masks,"Uber drivers and passengers in most countries will have to wear face masks from next week as the ride-hailing firm toughens its coronavirus policy.The new rule takes effect on Monday. It applies to services in the US, Canada, Mexico, India and most of Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.But the UK is not on the list, following government guidance which advises but does not require people to wear face coverings in confined spaces.Although it is not making it compulsory to wear a face mask in the UK, Uber said it had distributed free protective equipment to UK drivers, including more than a million single-use face masks, as well as 95,000 cleaning sprays. In the coming weeks, it will hand out another two million masks. ""As well as working with Unilever to provide drivers with free sanitising products, Uber is distributing millions of masks and directly reimbursing drivers if they choose to source the PPE themselves,"" an Uber spokesman told the BBC. At the same time, Uber, along with taxi firm Addison Lee, has announced new safety measures as the government looks to ease coronavirus restrictions and people return to work.Addison Lee will fit perspex partition screens between drivers and passengers across its 4,000 vehicles next week.And Uber is paying the AA to install partitions in 400 cars in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham as part of an initial pilot.""We know there is significant demand from drivers, passengers, businesses and the general public for more to be done to make transport cleaner and safer as we go back to work - including calls for the introduction of partition screens into private hire vehicles,"" said Liam Griffin, chief executive of London-based Addison Lee.""That's why we have taken the decision to begin rolling out the installation of safety screens between drivers and passenger seats.""Uber said its pilot in the North East of England was crucial for the company to get a better understanding of how to carry passengers on journeys as safely as possible.Uber is first trialling the partition screens in areas where it has been able to gain the permission of the regulator or city council, in order to ensure that the screens are installed safely. On Wednesday, Transport for London (TfL) updated its guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle firms. The regulator is advising firms to have drivers and passengers socially distance, with passengers sitting in the back seats of cars. It advised drivers to carry a bottle of hand sanitiser gel in their vehicle that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, when it comes to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks, gloves or partition walls, TfL said it is waiting to hear from the London Strategic Coordination Group (SCG) on recommendations before mandating additional coronavirus prevention and control measures for taxis and private hire vehicles.

""Two months into a public health emergency which has seen private hire drivers suffer one of the highest occupational mortality rates, yet TfL and the Department for Transport (DfT) are still not taking responsibility to introduce necessary safety controls,"" James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers trade body, told the BBC.""Poor regulatory standards and employment misclassification has become a lethal combination for desperately exploited drivers.""The trade body is similarly concerned that Uber is not providing partition screens to its drivers in other parts of the UK, such as London, which has the largest concentration of Uber drivers in the country.

Uber says 'no sacred cows' amid coronavirus crisis,"Uber has warned it may scale back parts of the business as it tries to navigate through the coronavirus crisis.""There are no sacred cows,"" said the taxi-hailing app's chief financial officer Nelson Chai.It follows Uber's announcement on Wednesday that it would cut about 14% of its staff.That move, and others the firm has made, will save more than $1bn (Â£810m) this year, but more measures may be necessary Mr Chai said on Thursday.Uber, known for its ride-hailing app, has also ventured into other areas, such as driverless cars and freight. But since chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over after the ouster of founder Travis Kalanick, the firm has concentrated more on its rides and food delivery business.

The firm was also hit by a drop in demand, as countries began to institute stay-at-home orders.Uber's rides business - which contributes the bulk of its revenue - was down 80% in April, after the orders were instituted, Mr Khosrowshahi said.But he added that he was encouraged by signs of recovery. In Hong Kong, for example, Mr Khosrowshahi said demand has returned to about 70% of its pre-crisis levels. In Texas and Georgia, where officials have relaxed restrictions, he said ridership has also been increasing slightly in recent weeks.Mr Khosrowshahi said that the crisis would delay the firm's goal of becoming profitable by a matter of ""quarters, not years"".""We're going to continue to look for more efficiencies.

Elon Musk: Tesla raises cost of 'self-driving' cars,"Tesla is raising the price of its ""self-driving"" option on its electric vehicles worldwide starting with a $1,000 (Â£820) hike.Founder Elon Musk tweeted that the price ""will continue to rise"" as its technology improves.But the entrepreneur said the technology it's adding will be worth more than $100,000.Mr Musk has been in a battle with officials in California over the restarting of Tesla's US car assembly.Tesla's ""full self-driving"" (FSD) option is called Autopilot, although it isn't fully autonomous. Autopilot has a number of features including automatic lane changes, parallel parking and a summon feature, which automatically parks and retrieves the car. Its upcoming features include automatic traffic light and stop sign control.The self-driving option will cost $8,000 when the price rise kicks in on 1 July.  ""The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval,"" Mr Musk said in a series of tweets on Monday. ""[At] that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000."" Tesla was investigated by regulators in the US after a driver was killed while using Autopilot in 2018. However, the investigation discovered the driver was playing a video game on his smartphone at the time of the crash.Mr Musk is well-known for his frequent tweets, many of which have landed him in trouble.Tesla Full Self-Driving option cost rises by ~$1000 worldwide on July 1st. Order a Tesla online in less than 2 minutes at https://t.co/qJm9uPBCX5End of Twitter post  by @elonmuskOne tweet earlier this month wiped $14bn off Tesla's market value after Mr Musk wrote its share price was too high.His latest tweets have also caused a little controversy online, with some questioning the $100,000 or more value he claims the self-driving software will be worth.One reply said the value Mr Musk claims the self-driving package to be worth was ""insane"". ""Elon, real talk, i love you and the mission, but FSD will never be worth that much,"" the tweet added.The best-selling Tesla Model 3 currently sells for $33,690 in the US if a driver opts for the basic package.

Uber says 'no sacred cows' amid coronavirus crisis,"Uber has warned it may scale back parts of the business as it tries to navigate through the coronavirus crisis.""There are no sacred cows,"" said the taxi-hailing app's chief financial officer Nelson Chai.It follows Uber's announcement on Wednesday that it would cut about 14% of its staff.That move, and others the firm has made, will save more than $1bn (Â£810m) this year, but more measures may be necessary Mr Chai said on Thursday.Uber, known for its ride-hailing app, has also ventured into other areas, such as driverless cars and freight. But since chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who took over after the ouster of founder Travis Kalanick, the firm has concentrated more on its rides and food delivery business. As the pandemic takes a financial toll, executives warned that they are looking for places to cut.""We're taking a hard look at our overall cost structure...to ensure our core business of rides and eats emerges stronger than ever,"" Mr Khosrowshahi told investors in a call to discuss the firm's quarterly results.Uber said revenue in the three months to 31 March 2020 reached $3.5bn, up 14% year-on-year, in part due to increased food delivery.But the firm's losses surged to $2.9bn, compared to $1bn a year ago.Some of the decline was due to write-downs of the worth of minority investments. The firm was also hit by a drop in demand, as countries began to institute stay-at-home orders.Uber's rides business - which contributes the bulk of its revenue - was down 80% in April, after the orders were instituted, Mr Khosrowshahi said.But he added that he was encouraged by signs of recovery. In Hong Kong, for example, Mr Khosrowshahi said demand has returned to about 70% of its pre-crisis levels. In Texas and Georgia, where officials have relaxed restrictions, he said ridership has also been increasing slightly in recent weeks.Mr Khosrowshahi said that the crisis would delay the firm's goal of becoming profitable by a matter of ""quarters, not years"".""We're going to continue to look for more efficiencies.

Coronavirus: Uber tells all drivers to wear face masks,"Uber drivers and passengers in most countries will have to wear face masks from next week as the ride-hailing firm toughens its coronavirus policy.The new rule takes effect on Monday. It applies to services in the US, Canada, Mexico, India and most of Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.But the UK is not on the list, following government guidance which advises but does not require people to wear face coverings in confined spaces.Although it is not making it compulsory to wear a face mask in the UK, Uber said it had distributed free protective equipment to UK drivers, including more than a million single-use face masks, as well as 95,000 cleaning sprays. In the coming weeks, it will hand out another two million masks. ""As well as working with Unilever to provide drivers with free sanitising products, Uber is distributing millions of masks and directly reimbursing drivers if they choose to source the PPE themselves,"" an Uber spokesman told the BBC. At the same time, Uber, along with taxi firm Addison Lee, has announced new safety measures as the government looks to ease coronavirus restrictions and people return to work.Addison Lee will fit perspex partition screens between drivers and passengers across its 4,000 vehicles next week.And Uber is paying the AA to install partitions in 400 cars in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham as part of an initial pilot.""We know there is significant demand from drivers, passengers, businesses and the general public for more to be done to make transport cleaner and safer as we go back to work - including calls for the introduction of partition screens into private hire vehicles,"" said Liam Griffin, chief executive of London-based Addison Lee.""That's why we have taken the decision to begin rolling out the installation of safety screens between drivers and passenger seats.""Uber said its pilot in the North East of England was crucial for the company to get a better understanding of how to carry passengers on journeys as safely as possible.Uber is first trialling the partition screens in areas where it has been able to gain the permission of the regulator or city council, in order to ensure that the screens are installed safely. On Wednesday, Transport for London (TfL) updated its guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle firms. The regulator is advising firms to have drivers and passengers socially distance, with passengers sitting in the back seats of cars. It advised drivers to carry a bottle of hand sanitiser gel in their vehicle that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, when it comes to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks, gloves or partition walls, TfL said it is waiting to hear from the London Strategic Coordination Group (SCG) on recommendations before mandating additional coronavirus prevention and control measures for taxis and private hire vehicles. The BBC understands that a number of taxi firms in the UK are seeking clarification from the government on health and safety precautions to take once the lockdown ends, and would prefer regulation rather than advice.In Wales, taxi drivers told the BBC they experience anxiety with every passenger they pick up, and are still waiting for approval from their local councils before they can make any modifications to their vehicles, such as installing a screen. ""Two months into a public health emergency which has seen private hire drivers suffer one of the highest occupational mortality rates, yet TfL and the Department for Transport (DfT) are still not taking responsibility to introduce necessary safety controls,"" James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers trade body, told the BBC.""Poor regulatory standards and employment misclassification has become a lethal combination for desperately exploited drivers.""The trade body is similarly concerned that Uber is not providing partition screens to its drivers in other parts of the UK, such as London, which has the largest concentration of Uber drivers in the country. Mr Farrar wants to see Uber commit to limiting bookings to no more than two passengers per vehicle, and to make the wearing of masks mandatory for both drivers and passengers. For now, there is no evidence available that demonstrates that partitions in taxis will reduce the risk of transmitting the coronavirus. But there is some evidence that the use of cloth face coverings can help to reduce transmission of coronavirus infection where it is not possible for people to maintain a distance of 2m.",14 May 2020,business

"UK unemployment increases by 50,000","UK unemployment rose by 50,000 to 1.35 million in the three months to March, as the effects of the coronavirus lockdown started to hit the economy.The unemployment rate was estimated at 3.9%, slightly up on the previous quarter, the Office for National Statistics said.Before the lockdown began, employment had hit a record high.The figures only cover the first week of the lockdown and the total is likely to worsen sharply in the coming months.Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told the BBC: ""We can reasonably expect unemployment to rise very quickly to something over 10% - something we haven't seen since the early 1990s.""People who are at home on furlough are not counted in the jobless total.However, the total number of weekly hours worked showed its largest annual decrease in 10 years.Estimates based on returns for individual weeks suggest that this fall was mostly caused by the decrease in hours in the last week of March, with a much smaller decrease in the previous week, the ONS said.

Electric bikes 'could help people return to work',"Electric bikes can slash transport emissions and offer workers a way to return to the workplace during coronavirus, a new study has found. If e-bikes took off in the same way in the UK, as in many European cities, it would reduce congestion, improve mobility, and save CO2, the study says.It said the UK government hadnât yet realised the strategic importance of e-bikes, push-bikes with electric motors.The greatest impact would be in areas with poor public transport, it found.That's because a wider range of people would be able to use e-bikes, it said.The research comes from the publicly funded Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions (Creds), based in Oxford.The researchers say that in Denmark, where cycling has been strongly encouraged for decades, e-bike routes are already linking cities to towns and villages. The research comes at a time when ministers are desperate for solutions which allow people to get to work without risking their health on public transport, but also without increasing carbon emissions.So far the main emphasis has been on bringing people into city centres, where popup cycle lanes are being introduced.But the Creds paper says e-bikes can be particularly effective in economically-deprived areas where people canât afford cars, but bus services are poor.This could be in suburban or semi-rural areas.It says the UK government should find ways to incentivise the use of e-bikes.Professor Nick Eyre from Creds told BBC News: ""E-bikes give us an exciting new opportunity to reduce energy use and carbon emissions. âThey need to be part of the plan for the major investment we need in transport to get people moving safely again in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable."" Critics could say that creating a major network of e-bike lanes would be expensive and sometimes not feasible. There will also be problems with bike theft â and of culture in places where there is little history of cycling.    Professor Eyre said: âWe know cycling is culturally dependent. Thereâs much more cycling here in Oxford than in Leeds, for example. ""Itâs partly because Leeds is bigger and hillier, but itâs partly because in Oxford cycling is just something we do.â[But] the last few weeks have shown us thereâs much more capacity for people to change than we previously thought.âSome planners believe the UK is on the brink of an urban transport revolution. The government is currently consulting the public on the use of electric scooters on Britainâs streets.However, a wide range of organisations, from pedestrians to motorists, have expressed their fears about the potential dangers of e-scooters, whether on the pavement or on the road.Follow Roger on Twitter.",18 May 2020,business
Japan's economy falls into recession as virus takes its toll,"Japan has fallen into recession for the first time since 2015 as the financial toll of the coronavirus continues to escalate.The world's third biggest economy shrank at an annual pace of 3.4% in the first three months of 2020.The coronavirus is wreaking havoc on the global economy with an estimated cost of up to $8.8tn (Â£7.1tn).Last week, Germany slipped into recession as more major economies face the impact of sustained lockdowns.Japan did not go into full national lockdown, but issued a state of emergency in April which severely affected supply chains and businesses in the trade-reliant nation.The 3.4% fall in growth domestic product (GDP) for the first three months of 2020, follows a 6.4% decline during the last quarter of 2019, pushing Japan into a technical recession.Consumers in Japan have been hit by the dual impact of the coronavirus and a sales tax hike to 10% from 8% in October. While Japan has lifted the state of emergency in 39 out of its 47 prefectures, the economic outlook for this current quarter is equally gloomy. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the country's economy to shrink 22% during the April-to-June period, which would be its biggest decline on record. The Japanese government has already announced a record $1 trillion stimulus package, and the Bank of Japan expanded its stimulus measures for the second straight month in April. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged a second budget later this month to fund fresh spending measures to cushion the economic blow of the pandemic.Japan faces a unique challenge as its economy has been stagnant for decades, compared to the more buoyant economies of rivals the US and China.Japan also relies heavily on exporting its goods and has little control over consumer demand in other countries, which has been severely impacted by coronavirus lockdowns. Many of its biggest brands, such as car firms Toyota and Honda, have seen sales slump across the world. Tourism, which has long been a boost to the Japanese economy, has also been hit hard as the pandemic keeps foreign visitors away. Japan has had more than 16,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and around 740 deaths.Things look bleak for the Japanese economy in the short term, along with other major economies around the world. But despite being the first of the world's top three economies to officially fall into recession, the country actually appears to be doing better, or less badly, than other major economies. While economists predict Japan's economy will shrink at an annual pace of  22% in the April-to-June period, they also predict that the US could contract by more than 25%. The 3.4% annual rate of decline in the first quarter also compares favourably to the 4.8% the US suffered in the first three months of this year.This was the sharpest decline for the US economy, the world's biggest, since the Great Depression of the 1930s.China, the world's second largest economy, saw economic growth shrink 6.8% in the first three months of 2020 compared with a year earlier, its first quarterly contraction since records began.Both of those economies have not yet been confirmed as having fallen into a technical recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, but most economists expect them to in the coming months.",18 May 2020,business
Ryanair says passenger numbers set to halve,"Ryanair has said it expects passenger numbers to halve in the current financial year as the coronavirus crisis continues to blight air travel.The airline said it expected numbers to fall below 80 million, down from its original target of 154 million.But it said it would weather the pandemic and emerge stronger.Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair still planned to ramp up flights in July and said UK government quarantine plans were ""idiotic"".The prediction of lower passenger numbers came as Ryanair announced profits of just over â¬1bn (Â£894m) for the financial year to the end of March.The airline's profit was 13% up on the previous year's figure of â¬885m.Ryanair is set to cut 3,000 jobs - 15% of its workforce - as it restructures to cope with the coronavirus crisis.Chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC's Today programme that Ryanair still intended to restart large numbers of flights from July, despite government plans to introduce a 14-day quarantine for people arriving in the UK, including returning holidaymakers.Mr O'Leary repeated his criticism of the quarantine plan, saying: ""It's idiotic and it's un-implementable. You don't have enough police in the UK.""He said the policy had ""no credibility"" and predicted that it would be gone by June.Ryanair said 2021 would be a ""difficult"" year as it worked hard to return to scheduled flying. But it said its balance sheet was one of the strongest in the industry, with cash reserves of more than â¬4bn.""Unlike many flag carrier competitors, Ryanair will not request or receive state aid,"" it added.Ryanair said it could not provide any profit guidance for the current financial year, but it expected to report a loss of more than â¬200m in the April-to-June period.""As we look beyond the next year, there will be significant opportunities for Ryanair's low-cost growth model as competitors shrink, fail or are acquired by government bailed-out carriers,"" it said.",18 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Self-employed grant claims top two million,"More than two million self-employed people whose businesses are affected by coronavirus have applied for government grants, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said.The value of the claims made so far is Â£6bn, he told the House of Commons.He said the money would reach claimants within six working days.The Self Employed Income Support Scheme is designed to support people in a similar way to the scheme for furloughed employees. The grants are calculated as 80% of monthly profit, averaged out over a period of up to three years and capped at Â£7,500.The money is paid out in a single instalment covering three months.

According to the latest figures given by the chancellor, more than half of them have put in claims.Mr Sunak has described it as ""one of the most generous schemes anywhere in the world"".However, those who started in business from early April last year will miss out, as will those who pay themselves just with dividends from a limited company.",18 May 2020,business
"The man who bought 60,000 oil and gas wells","The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Rusty Hutson Jr, founder and chief executive of US energy firm Diversified Gas & Oil (DGO).In the end, Rusty Hutson Jr couldn't escape the calling of the family trade.Born and raised in a blue-collar household in the oil and gas fields of West Virginia, his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all earned their livings in the energy sector.They worked at the wells, and on the pipelines, putting in a hard shift of manual labour, day after day, year after year, to provide for their families.During his summer holidays from high school and then college, Rusty would go to work with his dad.But when he became the first Hutson to graduate from university, in 1991, he decided he wanted to do something completely different with his life.""I decided that going into oil and gas was about the last thing I wanted to do,"" he says. ""I didn't want a part of it when I got out. It's really hard work.""So armed with an accountancy degree from West Virginia's Fairmont State University he went off to have a successful banking career for the next decade, ending up in Birmingham, Alabama.But as the years progressed, Rusty says it started to nag at him that he hadn't followed his dad into the family industry.""West Virginia was a tough state when I was growing up. Still is,"" he says. ""And there were two kinds of people - you either worked in coal, or you worked in oil and gas. It was a generational thing - if your dad and grandfather did it for a living, then you did it.""And as the years progressed I increasingly felt drawn back to that world. I also had this desire to build something, to do something entrepreneurial.""So in 2001, aged 32, Rusty bought an old gas well back in West Virginia for $250,000 (Â£200,000). He raised the money by remortgaging his home.""It was a small old well, it had been in production for years, but it was like gold to me,"" he says. ""I spent the next four years still also working in the bank, but any spare time I had I'd fly up to West Virginia to work alongside the one well tender that I had back then.""Fast-forward to today, and Rusty's company, DGO, now owns more than 60,000 gas and oil wells across West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, a region called the Appalachia. Employing 925 people it has annual revenues of more than $500m. Some 90% of its operation is natural gas, with 10% oil.The company's business model is a very specific one - it doesn't do any drilling to find new oil and gas reserves. Instead it buys up old oil and gas wells that bigger producers no longer want, because the initial large flow levels have fallen to low volumes.""They don't want these old wells, but the average remaining life on most of these wells is 50 years,"" he says. ""So we can come in, run them very efficiently, and make money.""Rusty says that DGO has been greatly helped by the so-called ""dash for shale"" in the US over the past decade, whereby oil and gas firms gave up traditional oil and gas wells to switch to fracking instead.In very simple terms, unlike traditional wells where oil and gas is sucked up, fracking involves first injecting a high pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals into shale rock. This fractures the rock, and allows the removal of vast quantities of oil and gas that wasn't previously accessible.Rusty says the industry-wide move to fracking, and its higher production volumes, meant that DGO has been able to buy thousands of old, but still productive, traditional wells cheaply, and rapidly expand the business.To help raise funds for continuing expansion, in 2017 the company decided to go public and sell its shares on a stock exchange. In an unusual move for a US firm, Rusty chose the London Stock Exchange's (LSE's) Alternative Investment Market.""We weren't big enough at the time to float in the US,"" he says. ""And I didn't want to go down the private equity route because I didn't want to work for somebody else, and try to earn back some of the percentage.""More The Boss features:DGO is now in the process of moving up to the Main Market of the LSE.Energy sector analyst James McCormack of Cenkos Securities says that DGO's strategy of ""acquiring low-cost, long-life, low-decline [oil and gas] production"" is ""a virtually unique proposition"". He adds: ""Under Rusty's leadership, DGO has grown rapidly since its IPO (initial public offering) in February 2017, increasing production 20 times and reserves 23 times.""Fellow energy analyst Carlos Gomes of Edison says that DGO is now the largest conventional gas producer in the Appalachia region. ""The company possesses long-life, low operational cost, mature producing assets that generate very stable cash flows,"" he adds.The long-term plan at DGO is to keep buying wells to replace any that eventually come to the end of production, and Rusty says the firm is now looking to expand into other regions, such as down in Texas.In the more immediate term, he says that he is relaxed about the big falls in oil and gas prices since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, both because he has long-term ""hedges"" or agreements in place on what price he sells his production for, and because his business operates more efficiently than its larger rivals.He can also turn to his dad for help and advice. His father, Rusty Sr, is the supervisor for the company's northern West Virginia operation.""He's 72 and he just absolutely loves it,"" says Rusty. ""Does he try to tell me what to do? Oh, absolutely.""",18 May 2020,business

He was going to pop the question to his partner of six years, Becky Firth, during the holiday of a lifetime to Japan. He pictured it happening amongst the blossom.Coronavirus put a stop to that. The holiday was cancelled.However, the couple managed in March to complete their planned move from London back to the north of England where they had both grown up. They had planned to stay with their parents in Saltaire, near Bradford, while they looked for a new home. But since both sets of parents are vulnerable, the couple had to move in with friends instead.James, a product consultant for a technology firm, decided to improvise his proposal plans in these far from ideal circumstances.âI set up a treasure hunt in the village where she grew up with riddles and poems in meaningful places,â he explains. Since he did it on her 30th birthday, she didnât necessarily suspect what was to come. The final clue led to a spot on the moors, where he asked the big question. She said yes.The tricky thing from a practical point of view was the ring, explains James. He wasnât sure he wanted to buy an expensive diamond one online and have it arrive by post, but of course he couldnât go to a shop because of lockdown.In the end, he decided to buy a ring online that he would use just for the proposal. He knew it still had to look good, and similar to the real one he would eventually get so that they could show if off in engagement photos, he says. The couple plan to wait until 2022 to get married, because they know there will be huge pressure to hold postponed weddings next year.This is something we can celebrate now, and cherish, despite coronavirus, says James.In Northamptonshire, Marilyn Coles, 24, and Roland Walet, 26, were also in lockdown.They met on Tinder last year and have been living together for just over six months.They hadnât been thinking about marriage before, but coronavirus focused their minds.âLockdown is a stressful situation and itâs brought us closer together,â says Roland. âSpending more time together has bonded us, we can see every side of each other.âIt allowed Roland to get to know Marilynâs son from a previous relationship properly, he adds.âSuddenly I could see myself spending the rest of my life with Marilyn.âMarilyn remembers the day of the proposal well.âThe doorbell rings and he went a bit giddy as he went down the stairs, bless him.ââI suspected it was the ring at last,â explains Roland. He had got one customised online.After a quick inspection to make sure it was what he expected inside the envelope, he braced himself and returned upstairs to propose in the bedroom.The prospect of big ceremonies and occasions, says Marilyn, makes her feel anxious, so this was just the kind of proposal she wanted.Roland is a Dutch national and the couple plan to marry next year in Amsterdam in an informal ceremony with friends.âLove doesnât wait,â says Tobias Kormind, head of jewellers 77 Diamonds, with a wry smile. It specialises in selling diamond rings online and ships more than 10,000 each year.He anticipated âa massive drop in demandâ as a result of coronavirus, up to 80% of sales perhaps, he says.In fact, so far his company has seen a sales drop of only around a quarter.Normally he sells 60% of rings online and the rest in physical stores, but online sales have risen since lockdown, helping to stabilise the business.âMany customers have told us that even though they can no longer travel to a special proposal location, they donât want to wait and are proposing at home instead in very thoughtful and imaginative ways,â says Kormind.âIf someone feels the time is right to propose, then itâs right. The setting is only really window dressing. In times of crisis you get to know people a lot better, a lot quicker.âWith lockdown, itâs like you actually have the government pushing love,â he jokes.Hamish Shephard, founder of wedding planning platform Bridebook, has spotted a similar trend.âWe thought our business would grind to a halt when coronavirus struck,â he says.Bridebook has handled more than 170,000 weddings since starting in 2015.In fact new sign-ups to his service this April only dropped slightly compared with the previous year, by around 5%.The feedback from customers is that despite unprecedented financial pressures, and the inability to hold wedding ceremonies, couples still want to get engaged, says Shephard.He too puts it down to couples spending more time together.Ones who are furloughed are getting the chance to share hobbies and learn about each otherâs interests, outside of the usual grind of work, he says.He predicts that 2021 and 2022 will be bumper years for the wedding business. One of 77 Diamondâs recent customers is police officer Daniel Hughes-McConnell, 30. He originally had grand plans for a proposal in New York.He was well aware that his long-term girlfriend, nurse Emily Hands, also 30, had dreamed of it happening next to the Rockefeller Plaza Christmas tree. Sheâd had the idea since watching the film Home Alone as a little girl.He made the necessary arrangements, but the dream was quashed when travel firm Thomas Cook collapsed.Daniel then planned to propose on a trip to Italy. When coronavirus forced him to cancel their travel plans again, he thought he was cursed.Like James, he decided to adapt his plans to the new reality of lockdown, rather than delay.He admits to being a little apprehensive about getting the ring in the post. It was sent first class and recorded delivery. But he ended up getting in a panic because he forgot there was a bank holiday coming, which delayed its arrival by a day (Emilyâs face winces in disbelief during our video call as he apparently shares this detail for the first time).Daniel proposed on a beach near where the couple live in Prestatyn in North Wales, a place they used to take romantic walks together when they first starting going out.He chose a spot to go down on one knee with extra significance for Emily - a bench commemorating her best friend from school, who died a few years ago.Emily was touched by the gesture and is glad the couple didnât postpone the engagement, waiting for a grander and more expensive proposal abroad.âIn fact, the cheaper proposal has been a blessing in disguise,â says Daniel.âThe money we saved by not going to New York or Rome, will be spent on our first baby, who we are expecting in November.â If you have an inspiring personal story about being in lockdown, contact reporter Dougal Shaw",17 May 2020,business
My Money: 'No expenditure at all today!',"My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here Bex Young takes us through a week in her life in lockdown.Bex, 32, works for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), at the Jobcentre in Dundee. The centre is closed to the public but she is still going into work in the office, which has introduced social distancing measures.She loves running and has done several 10ks and half marathons. Her next challenge is the full marathon - she isn't sure she has the patience for it but is definitely going to try.She usually spends a lot of time with friends - going for cocktails at weekends, pub crawls and trips to different cities. She also loves fashion and is known for her bright and sparkly outfits and shoes. She is gutted there's no reason to get properly dressed up just now, with pubs and bars closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Over to Bex....06:15 - Wake up feeling fed up, another week of lockdown. At least the sun is shining and it's a bank holiday on Friday so feel a lot better once I'm up and about.13:20 - Doing different food shops as and when I need to. Head to Lidl on my lunch break and get a pack of Cup a Soups, hash browns, red peppers, onion dip and Mexican rice all for only Â£3.90.Total spend: Â£3.9013:30 - Go to Tesco on my lunch break today and buy Quorn cocktail sausages and mini cucumbers to snack on. Another nice day so I walk near the City Quay for 20 minutes and enjoy the view.16.30 - Waiting to move into my new house on 19 June and I'm so glad B&Q has reopened. I go in for paint and, after deciding I need more time, I come out with just three colour charts to study.Total spend: Â£2.8012:30 - M&S here is usually fairly quiet with no queue to get in but there is today. Can't be bothered but persevere as I want their giant stuffed tortellini and espresso martini bottled cocktail mix, which I find reduced to Â£5.50, yay! Also buy a box of cherry tomatoes and avocados for a sunny day salad. Grand total Â£9.50.15:00 - Arrive home to find my retro games console has arrived from Amazon. It was an impulse buy the other day as it had good reviews and 400 games. After an hour on Tetris and Aladdin I finally switch it off.

What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (Â£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  We have lost 500 Billion Dollars a year, for many years, on Crazy Trade with China. NO MORE!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpOne of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (Â£19 and Â£23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (Â£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (Â£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

But analyst Richard Lin of Retail Economics said stores ""will have to discount heavily"" to sell excess stock that may now be out of season.""Many clothing retailers have been sitting there with stores full of stock which they haven't be able to shift,"" he said.""One of the most pressing issues for retailers is working capital and there is a huge overhang of inventory at fashion stores.""Fashion retailers have been badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Even those with robust online offerings have reported huge drops in sales.Next, for instance, saw online sales decline by 32% in the three months to the end of April. Like others, it is keen to re-open stores, as soon as it is deemed safe to do so.Next said: ""We have plans in place for the re-purposing of our stores ready to reopen in a socially-distanced world.""Its measures include installing screens at tills, placing sanitisation stations in stores and managing the number of customers that are allowed to enter its shops.M&S has kept its food stores open during the crisis, including almost 300 shops that sell fashion as well, although these areas have been blocked off.But it says they're ready to be reopened as soon as the government gives it the green light.""Our 290 stores that sell both clothing and food are led by a single manager - so it means they already have a brilliant working knowledge of the necessary hygiene measures, how to manage social distancing and the flow of our customers in and out of their store,"" M&S said.Last week the government said its strategy was to ""open non-essential retail when and where it is safe to do so"", and subject to those retailers being able to follow new guidelines.It said the intention was for this to happen in phases from 1 June, although it added that it would issue further guidance on which businesses will be allowed to open and when.That guidance can't come soon enough, according to Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC).""Retailers desperately need clarity in the rules regarding when and how they can open - details that are still lacking,"" she said.She warned that safety must be the primary concern in the decisions, rather than size or type of shop. The retail experience is going to be turned on its head when clothes stores reopen,"" predicted Mr Lin from Retail Economics.""Retailers are having to reinterpret government guidelines and have to invest heavily to make sure they can create a safe environment.""He said consumers will remain incredibly anxious and cautious about returning to fashion retailers.Changing rooms are expected to remain closed while customers will be encouraged to avoid touching merchandise.""Staff will potentially have to walk around spraying shelves,"" Mr Lin said.There are likely to be one-way systems through stores with clear floor markings and signage, while customer entry will be limited and consumers will be encouraged to shop alone.Next said it will ""prioritise the opening of our larger out-of-town stores first"".Their bigger size makes them easier to adapt and they have large car parks and outside spaces to manage queues, it said.""Retailers have started to plan how they can open stores and follow safety guidelines, with some hinting at sales when they do open their doors, such as Next,"" said Dan Plant, savings expert at UKHotDeals.""Other popular stores, like Primark, lack online sales space, so we'd expect to see plenty of fashion offers when retailers reopen.""But while fashion stores may reopen with deep discounts to clear old stock, most online retailers have already been offering sales to encourage shoppers.M&S, for instance, launched its ""rainbow sale"" on Friday with up to 50% off and 10% of takings going to NHS charities.Boohoo, Fat Face, French Connection, Gap, JD Sports , Next, Superdry and Topshop have offered similar 50%-off deals.The likes of Asos, Clarks, Dune, Debenhams, John Lewis, Karen Millen, New Look, Office and Quiz have also been offering cut-price deals.

"Coronavirus: 6,000 jobs at risk at Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia owner","The owner of High Street restaurant chains Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia has filed intent to appoint administrators at the High Court.Owner Casual Dining Group, whose brands also include the Las Iguanas chain, employs about 6,000 people.The company said the move would give it ten days' breathing space to consider ""all options"" for restructuring.Restaurants have been hit hard after shutting their doors in March as part of Britain's virus lockdown.Earlier on Monday, Casual Dining Group said that it is working with advisers from corporate finance firm AlixPartners over a potential restructuring programme.A Casual Dining Group spokeswoman said: ""As is widely acknowledged, this is an unprecedented situation for our industry and, like many other companies across the UK, the directors of Casual Dining Group are working closely with our advisers as we consider our next steps.""These notifications are a prudent measure in light of the company's position and the wider situation.""The firm said the move would protect it from any threatened legal action from landlords.The notice of intent to appoint administrators gives the firm ten days to put a restructuring plan into place.After that ten days is up, the firm could let the notice lapse, if there is a viable restructuring  plan.But if there is no feasible restructuring plan, the firm must either ask for another ten days to come up with one, or it could appoint administrators for the business.The restructuring plan could involve so-called ""company voluntary arrangements"" (CVAs), which allow a firm to keep trading while reducing rents. It could also see one or more of the firm's brands put into administration.The UK's casual dining chains had a tough few years even before the coronavirus pandemic arrived. Many struggled with a raft of increasing costs, including upwards-only rent reviews, business rates, a rising minimum wage and the apprenticeship levy.A rise in the cost of imported food following the sharp drop in the value of the pound amid Brexit uncertainty was another pressure point. Some well-known names, including Jamie Oliver's restaurant empire, the burger chain Byron, and the Chiquito and Frankie & Benny's owner have either closed sites or had to put in place emergency financial measures.",18 May 2020,business
Huawei calls US rules 'arbitrary and pernicious',"Huawei has said new US export rules to limit its access to key technology are ""arbitrary and pernicious"".The Chinese tech giant warned investors the restrictions would ""inevitably"" hurt its business, and could damage the global technology industry.The US had already put Huawei on a blacklist last year, calling the company a national security threat.A statement said the US was in a relentless pursuit to tighten its stranglehold on our company, But chairman Guo Ping told an analyst summit on Monday: ""Luckily we have survived so far.""The US on Friday said it would require global semiconductor-makers that use US technology and software in chip design to seek US government approval to ship to Huawei.It said the added control was necessary to close a loophole that had emerged since the US last year moved to cut off Huawei from access to US-made semiconductor chips, which form the backbone of many computer and phone systems.""Our business will inevitably be impacted,"" Guo Ping said of the new rules. ""In spite of that, as the challenges over the past year have helped us develop a thicker skin, we are confident about finding solutions soon"".Since being put on the US blacklist last year, he said Huawei had been forced to rewrite computer code, review procurement and spend thousands of hours to ensure business continuity.""Huawei is just like this plane riddled with bullet holes,"" he said. ""Over the past year, patching up the holes was our priority."" However, the firm warned that the new rules would hurt the firm's ability to serve and maintain its networks and services for billions of customers around the world. Huawei said the US campaign against the company would ultimately damage the country's credibility with international companies.""It will damage the trust and collaboration within the global semiconductor industry and could increase conflict and loss within these industries,"" it said.",18 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Shopping centre giant Intu warns of debt default risk,"Shopping centre operator Intu has warned that it risks defaulting on its debts unless its lenders give the firm significant breathing space.The coronavirus pandemic has hit rental income and Intu said there was no certainty how quickly the market would recover once the lockdown is lifted.It also said it was unable to sell any of its shopping centres to raise funds.The owner of Manchester's Trafford Centre is now asking lenders for a grace period of up to December 2021.The firm said its shopping centres would remain ""semi-closed"" until at least 1 June. Intu, which also controls Lakeside in Essex, was already struggling under Â£4.6bn worth of debt prior to the Covid-19 crisis. Earlier this year, it planned to tap investors for Â£1.3bn but was forced to abandon the fund raising attempt.It is now seeking a so-called standstill agreement with its lenders, which would delay both debt repayments and tests on whether Intu has breached the covenants on its borrowings.The company said that once the current crisis had passed, it would then be in a better position to explore ""solutions"" as well as possible disposals of its shopping centres to ""ultimately fix the balance sheet"".Intu recently appointed David Hargrave, a former partner at accountancy firms PwC and EY, as its chief restructuring officer.A number of retailers including Debenhams have sought rent holidays from landlords, while others such as Primark and Burger King stopped paying rent in March.The government has also introduced measures to protect tenants from landlords using aggressive methods, such as winding up petitions, to collect rent.",18 May 2020,business
Japan's economy falls into recession as virus takes its toll,"Japan has fallen into recession for the first time since 2015 as the financial toll of the coronavirus continues to escalate.The world's third biggest economy shrank at an annual pace of 3.4% in the first three months of 2020.The coronavirus is wreaking havoc on the global economy with an estimated cost of up to $8.8tn (Â£7.1tn).Last week, Germany slipped into recession as more major economies face the impact of sustained lockdowns.Japan did not go into full national lockdown, but issued a state of emergency in April which severely affected supply chains and businesses in the trade-reliant nation.The 3.4% fall in growth domestic product (GDP) for the first three months of 2020, follows a 6.4% decline during the last quarter of 2019, pushing Japan into a technical recession.Consumers in Japan have been hit by the dual impact of the coronavirus and a sales tax hike to 10% from 8% in October. While Japan has lifted the state of emergency in 39 out of its 47 prefectures, the economic outlook for this current quarter is equally gloomy. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the country's economy to shrink 22% during the April-to-June period, which would be its biggest decline on record. The Japanese government has already announced a record $1 trillion stimulus package, and the Bank of Japan expanded its stimulus measures for the second straight month in April. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged a second budget later this month to fund fresh spending measures to cushion the economic blow of the pandemic.Japan faces a unique challenge as its economy has been stagnant for decades, compared to the more buoyant economies of rivals the US and China.Japan also relies heavily on exporting its goods and has little control over consumer demand in other countries, which has been severely impacted by coronavirus lockdowns. Many of its biggest brands, such as car firms Toyota and Honda, have seen sales slump across the world. Tourism, which has long been a boost to the Japanese economy, has also been hit hard as the pandemic keeps foreign visitors away. Japan has had more than 16,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and around 740 deaths.Things look bleak for the Japanese economy in the short term, along with other major economies around the world. But despite being the first of the world's top three economies to officially fall into recession, the country actually appears to be doing better, or less badly, than other major economies. While economists predict Japan's economy will shrink at an annual pace of  22% in the April-to-June period, they also predict that the US could contract by more than 25%. The 3.4% annual rate of decline in the first quarter also compares favourably to the 4.8% the US suffered in the first three months of this year.This was the sharpest decline for the US economy, the world's biggest, since the Great Depression of the 1930s.China, the world's second largest economy, saw economic growth shrink 6.8% in the first three months of 2020 compared with a year earlier, its first quarterly contraction since records began.Both of those economies have not yet been confirmed as having fallen into a technical recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, but most economists expect them to in the coming months.",18 May 2020,business
