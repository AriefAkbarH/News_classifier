Facebook's Zuckerberg defends actions on virus misinformation,"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has told the BBC that it had and would remove any content likely to result in ""immediate and imminent harm"" to users. ""Even if something isn't going to lead to imminent physical harm, we don't want misinformation to be the content that is going viral,"" he said. It removed Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's claim that scientists had ""proved"" there was a coronavirus cure.This was removed because it was ""obviously"" not true, he said. He also said that Facebook had removed content from groups claiming that the rollout of the 5G digital network was a cause of the spread of the virus and in some cases encouraged those who believed that to damage the networks physical infrastructure. Facebook recently removed content from former broadcaster and conspiracy theorist David Icke for ""repeatedly violating our policies on harmful misinformation"". Mr Icke had suggested that 5G mobile phone networks are linked to the spread of the virus and in another video he suggested a Jewish group was behind the virus.Mr Zuckerberg said: ""We work with independent fact checkers. Since the Covid outbreak, they have issued 7,500 notices of misinformation which has led to us issuing 50 million warning labels on posts. ""We know these are effective because 95% of the time, users don't click through to the content with a warning label.""However, Facebook has insisted that unless there was the prospect of real imminent harm, then the company would and should allow what he called the ""widest possible aperture"" for freedom of expression on the internet.He also told the BBC that preventing electoral interference is an ""arms race"" against countries such as Russia, Iran and China.He admitted that the firm was ""behind"" in the 2016 US presidential election.In his first UK broadcast interview in five years, he said that Facebook had been unprepared for state-sponsored interference in 2016.But he added the company was confident it had since learnt its lessons.Facebook was previously embroiled in a political scandal in which tens of millions of its users' data ended up in the hands of political interest groups including Cambridge Analytica.However, he said the social media giant, which also owns Whatsapp and Instagram, was now better prepared than other companies, and even governments, to prevent future attempts to influence political outcomes.""Countries are going to continue to try and interfere and we are going to see issues like that but we have learnt a lot since 2016 and I feel pretty confident that we are going to be able to protect the integrity of the upcoming election"".Mr Zuckerberg also defended his level of personal control over arguably the world's most powerful media platforms.Although Facebook is a public company worth nearly $700bn (£574bn), he ultimately exerts total individual control thanks to an ownership structure that gives him a controlling interest even though he owns a small fraction of the shares.He said it had allowed Facebook to make longer-term strategic decisions which have proved to be correct such as waiting to improve the Facebook experience before launching it on smartphones and not selling out early to rivals.""If it had been different then we would have sold out to Yahoo years ago and who knows what would have happened then. ""Yahoo is now worth 1/20th as much as Facebook.Facebook continues to face criticism over its reluctance to describe or define itself as a publisher and thus embrace the kind of editorial responsibility that newspapers and traditional broadcasters are legally bound by.However, it would be hard to argue that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have not provided billions of people with the kind of connectivity with friends and family that has been important during this global pandemic and the consequent restrictions on movement and freedom.In fact, after many years of courting controversy and opprobrium, it seems clear that Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg are feeling more confident about their public roles.If there are any winners out of this public health emergency, digital companies like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon are among them.However, no one is totally immune to the deep downturn that is already upon us and the evidence for which is confirmed with every new economic release.Facebook knows that and is one of the reasons it is keen to help small businesses online through this week's launch of a service called Facebook Shops.It's a mutually beneficial exchange. Those businesses are Facebook's current and future customers. What's good for them is good for Facebook.",21 May 2020,business

It thanked the UK and US governments for ""substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine"".It also said it was in discussions with the Serum Institute of India and other potential partners to increase production and distribution.Specifically, it said it had received support of more than $1bn from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine,AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot described the coronavirus pandemic as ""a global tragedy"" and ""a challenge for all of humanity"". ""We need to defeat the virus together or it will continue to inflict huge personal suffering and leave long-lasting economic and social scars in every country around the world,"" he said.

Coronavirus: Tinder boss says 'dramatic' changes to dating,"Coronavirus has had a ""dramatic"" effect on the way people use the dating app Tinder, its boss has told BBC News, though the changes may suit plans he already had in store for the platform.The coronavirus outbreak and lockdown conditions have brought mixed fortunes to online-dating platforms like Tinder, according to its chief executive Elie Seidman.On the one hand, user engagement is up, a trend other dating apps have reported too. Tinder users made 3 billion swipes worldwide on Sunday 29 March, the most the app has ever recorded in a single day. In the UK, daily conversations rose by 12% between mid-February and the end of March.There has been a ""dramatic shift"" in behaviour metrics which are normally stable, says Mr Seidman.However, the economic impact of lockdown means people have less money to spend.This is not such good news for Tinder, which is free but relies on premium subscriptions for its revenue.“The [US] unemployment figures are hard to see,” says Mr Seidman. “I’m very concerned about what happens economically for our society and the impact it will have on so many of our members.""Tinder has been downloaded more than 340 million times since its launch in 2012. But the vast majority of its revenues come from just 6 million subscribers who pay for the ""gold"" service. The rate at which it picked up those precious paying-users declined as lockdown struck. The company’s data show that new sign-ups for premium membership pick up where lockdowns start to ease, says Mr Siedman.“You can literally see the comeback on a state by state basis [in the US], as things come out and start to loosen up, as the peak crisis starts to pass.”Other platforms which offer free sign-up have noticed something similar during lockdown.“We’ve seen a surge in activity,” says Charly Lester, dating expert for The Inner Circle platform. “Matches have risen by 15% and the number of messages sent is up by 10%, but we’ve also noticed less willingness to pay.”Mr Siedman says you might have to wait two or three financial quarters to see the full economic impact on Tinder, as the scale of the global crisis becomes clear.The other issue that will become clear with time is whether the popularity of virtual dating, by video call, is here to stay, once physical meet-ups with strangers become more possible.Platforms like eHarmony, OKCupid and Match have reported a big rise in video dates.Tinder is planning to roll out its own video dating function in June, says Mr Seidman.The video call service will operate on a double opt-in policy, so both sides of the match would have to agree to it. It will be free and supported by a team of moderators.The changes to dating brought in by coronavirus lockdowns have merely accelerated a generational change the company was already tracking in focus groups, says Mr Seidman.The 18-year-olds joining the app now, unlike their predecessors who joined in 2012, have grown up immersed in social media apps and see that virtual world as something quite natural, he explains.For this generation online matches aren’t just about organising a meet-up in real life, they are about having fulfilling online experiences too.For this reason the company has been working on making Tinder less of a place to organise ""hook ups"" offline and more of a place to hang out online, to get to know people. It is trialling virtual spaces and live events where people can meet and match on the platform, like Swipe Nights and quizzes. Mr Seidman sums up the creed of the new young crop of Tinder users: “Your digital life is as important as your social life in the physical world.”In a world of continued social distancing, this creed may also have to be embraced to some extent by older daters too.You can follow reporter Dougal on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc",21 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: EasyJet to resume flights in June,"EasyJet has said it will resume some flights on 15 June, with all passengers and cabin crew told to wear face masks to protect against the coronavirus.The airline announced that it would restart a ""small number"" of routes where there is enough customer demand.The initial schedule will include domestic routes across the UK and France.EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said that ""these are small and carefully planned steps"".From June, EasyJet will fly between UK airports including Gatwick, Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Belfast.The airline told the BBC that from mid-June it would be running 189 flights per week on average. The only international service from the UK will fly from Gatwick to Nice.Elsewhere, some services will resume between Portugal, Switzerland and Spain.UK FranceSwitzerlandSpainPortugal Mr Lundgren said that further routes would be announced over the coming weeks ""as customer demand increases and lockdown measures across Europe are relaxed"". The firm grounded its entire fleet in March as global travel came to a near-halt.When flights restart, no food will be available on board and customers will have hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes provided.EasyJet said that its aircraft would also be subject to ""enhanced cleaning and disinfection"".Mr Lundgren said: ""These measures will remain in place for as long as is needed to ensure customers and crew are able to fly safely as the world continues to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.""EasyJet's new rules were drawn up according to latest government advice and in consultation with aviation authorities such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).On Wednesday, EASA and the US Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued a new set of health standards for airlines hoping to start flying again. They recommend wearing face masks, physical distancing of 1.5m where possible in airports and washing hands often.They stopped short of calling for social distancing on planes due to the confined space, but added that other measures should be followed at all times.Meanwhile, Heathrow Airport will start using thermal cameras to carry out temperature checks in a trial on some passengers from its Terminal 2 on Thursday.Its chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, told the BBC's Today programme that this measure was already being used in many countries around the world. ""It will help us to understand whether this could be part of a common international standard to get people flying safely again,"" he said.Several other airlines have indicated that they are considering resuming flights in the next few months. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has said that the airline plans to ramp up flights in July when British Airways will also resume some flights.EasyJet's announcement followed the admission earlier this week that a ""highly sophisticated cyber-attack"" had affected about nine million of its customers.It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2,208 customers had also had their credit and debit card details ""accessed"".The firm first became aware of the attack in January, and has informed the UK's Information Commissioner's Office while it investigates the breach.",21 May 2020,business
US Senate passes bill that could delist some Chinese firms,"The US Senate has passed a bill that could block some Chinese companies from selling shares on American stock exchanges.It would require overseas firms to follow US standards for audits and other financial regulations.The measure now has to be passed by the House of Representatives before being signed into law by President Trump.It comes as US-China tensions increase over the virus pandemic and after the Luckin Coffee accounting scandal.The planned legislation would also require publicly traded companies to reveal whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.The bill applies to all foreign companies, but is targeted at China, and follows intense criticism of Beijing by Mr Trump and other US politicians.Mr Trump and officials in his administration argue that China mishandled the coronavirus outbreak in its early stages.The outbreak has now grown to become a pandemic that has killed almost 330,000 people worldwide and crippled the global economy.US-listed Chinese companies have already come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.The company said its own investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of last year to the fourth quarter amounted to about 2.2bn yuan ($310m; £254m). That equates to about 40% of its estimated annual sales.The Chinese coffee chain has since sacked its chief executive and chief operating officer, while six other employees who were alleged to have been involved in or known about the transactions have been suspended or put on leave.The scandal-hit firm has said it has been co-operating with regulators in the US and China, who have begun an investigation into the company.Luckin's Nasdaq listing had been one of China's few successful US stock market debuts of 2019.On Tuesday Luckin said the Nasdaq exchange had notified the company of plans to delist it due to concerns over the alleged fabricated sales and disclosure failures. Its shares will trade on the exchange pending the outcome of an appeal, expected within 45 days.The scandal-hit firm's shares, which had been suspended since 7 April, plunged by more than 35% after they resumed trading on Wednesday.",21 May 2020,business

US Senate passes bill that could delist some Chinese firms,"The US Senate has passed a bill that could block some Chinese companies from selling shares on American stock exchanges.It would require overseas firms to follow US standards for audits and other financial regulations.The measure now has to be passed by the House of Representatives before being signed into law by President Trump.It comes as US-China tensions increase over the virus pandemic and after the Luckin Coffee accounting scandal.The planned legislation would also require publicly traded companies to reveal whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.The bill applies to all foreign companies, but is targeted at China, and follows intense criticism of Beijing by Mr Trump and other US politicians.Mr Trump and officials in his administration argue that China mishandled the coronavirus outbreak in its early stages.The outbreak has now grown to become a pandemic that has killed almost 330,000 people worldwide and crippled the global economy.US-listed Chinese companies have already come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.The company said its own investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of last year to the fourth quarter amounted to about 2.2bn yuan ($310m; £254m). That equates to about 40% of its estimated annual sales.The Chinese coffee chain has since sacked its chief executive and chief operating officer, while six other employees who were alleged to have been involved in or known about the transactions have been suspended or put on leave.The scandal-hit firm has said it has been co-operating with regulators in the US and China, who have begun an investigation into the company.Luckin's Nasdaq listing had been one of China's few successful US stock market debuts of 2019.On Tuesday Luckin said the Nasdaq exchange had notified the company of plans to delist it due to concerns over the alleged fabricated sales and disclosure failures.

Clarks to cut 900 office jobs in virus shake-up,"Shoe chain Clarks will cut 900 office jobs worldwide as it tries to position itself for a post virus future.

Coronavirus: AstraZeneca ready to supply potential vaccine in September,"Drugs giant AstraZeneca has announced it is ready to provide a potential new coronavirus vaccine from September.The firm said it had concluded deals to deliver at least 400 million doses of the vaccine, which it is developing with Oxford University.AstraZeneca said it was capable of producing one billion doses of the AZD1222 vaccine this year and next.Initial trials are under way and AstraZeneca said it recognised that the vaccine might not work.But the company said it was committed to advancing the clinical programme.Scientists have warned that a coronavirus vaccine, if developed, might not confer full immunity, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that a vaccine might never be found.Despite these reservations, intensive research continues, with about 80 groups around the world working on possible vaccines.AstraZeneca indicated that production would take place in more than one country. It thanked the UK and US governments for ""substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine"".It also said it was in discussions with the Serum Institute of India and other potential partners to increase production and distribution.Specifically, it said it had received support of more than $1bn from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine,AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot described the coronavirus pandemic as ""a global tragedy"" and ""a challenge for all of humanity"". ""We need to defeat the virus together or it will continue to inflict huge personal suffering and leave long-lasting economic and social scars in every country around the world,"" he said.

Coronavirus: Tinder boss says 'dramatic' changes to dating,"Coronavirus has had a ""dramatic"" effect on the way people use the dating app Tinder, its boss has told BBC News, though the changes may suit plans he already had in store for the platform.The coronavirus outbreak and lockdown conditions have brought mixed fortunes to online-dating platforms like Tinder, according to its chief executive Elie Seidman.On the one hand, user engagement is up, a trend other dating apps have reported too. Tinder users made 3 billion swipes worldwide on Sunday 29 March, the most the app has ever recorded in a single day. In the UK, daily conversations rose by 12% between mid-February and the end of March.There has been a ""dramatic shift"" in behaviour metrics which are normally stable, says Mr Seidman.However, the economic impact of lockdown means people have less money to spend.This is not such good news for Tinder, which is free but relies on premium subscriptions for its revenue.“The [US] unemployment figures are hard to see,” says Mr Seidman. “I’m very concerned about what happens economically for our society and the impact it will have on so many of our members.""Tinder has been downloaded more than 340 million times since its launch in 2012. But the vast majority of its revenues come from just 6 million subscribers who pay for the ""gold"" service. The rate at which it picked up those precious paying-users declined as lockdown struck. The company’s data show that new sign-ups for premium membership pick up where lockdowns start to ease, says Mr Siedman.“You can literally see the comeback on a state by state basis [in the US], as things come out and start to loosen up, as the peak crisis starts to pass.”Other platforms which offer free sign-up have noticed something similar during lockdown.“We’ve seen a surge in activity,” says Charly Lester, dating expert for The Inner Circle platform. “Matches have risen by 15% and the number of messages sent is up by 10%, but we’ve also noticed less willingness to pay.”Mr Siedman says you might have to wait two or three financial quarters to see the full economic impact on Tinder, as the scale of the global crisis becomes clear.The other issue that will become clear with time is whether the popularity of virtual dating, by video call, is here to stay, once physical meet-ups with strangers become more possible.Platforms like eHarmony, OKCupid and Match have reported a big rise in video dates.Tinder is planning to roll out its own video dating function in June, says Mr Seidman.The video call service will operate on a double opt-in policy, so both sides of the match would have to agree to it. It will be free and supported by a team of moderators.The changes to dating brought in by coronavirus lockdowns have merely accelerated a generational change the company was already tracking in focus groups, says Mr Seidman.The 18-year-olds joining the app now, unlike their predecessors who joined in 2012, have grown up immersed in social media apps and see that virtual world as something quite natural, he explains.For this generation online matches aren’t just about organising a meet-up in real life, they are about having fulfilling online experiences too.For this reason the company has been working on making Tinder less of a place to organise ""hook ups"" offline and more of a place to hang out online, to get to know people. It is trialling virtual spaces and live events where people can meet and match on the platform, like Swipe Nights and quizzes. Mr Seidman sums up the creed of the new young crop of Tinder users: “Your digital life is as important as your social life in the physical world.”In a world of continued social distancing, this creed may also have to be embraced to some extent by older daters too.You can follow reporter Dougal on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc",21 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: EasyJet to resume flights in June,"EasyJet has said it will resume some flights on 15 June, with all passengers and cabin crew told to wear face masks to protect against the coronavirus.The airline announced that it would restart a ""small number"" of routes where there is enough customer demand.The initial schedule will include domestic routes across the UK and France.EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said that ""these are small and carefully planned steps"".From June, EasyJet will fly between UK airports including Gatwick, Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Belfast.The airline told the BBC that from mid-June it would be running 189 flights per week on average. The only international service from the UK will fly from Gatwick to Nice.Elsewhere, some services will resume between Portugal, Switzerland and Spain.UK FranceSwitzerlandSpainPortugal Mr Lundgren said that further routes would be announced over the coming weeks ""as customer demand increases and lockdown measures across Europe are relaxed"". The firm grounded its entire fleet in March as global travel came to a near-halt.When flights restart, no food will be available on board and customers will have hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes provided.EasyJet said that its aircraft would also be subject to ""enhanced cleaning and disinfection"".Mr Lundgren said: ""These measures will remain in place for as long as is needed to ensure customers and crew are able to fly safely as the world continues to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.""EasyJet's new rules were drawn up according to latest government advice and in consultation with aviation authorities such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).On Wednesday, EASA and the US Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued a new set of health standards for airlines hoping to start flying again. They recommend wearing face masks, physical distancing of 1.5m where possible in airports and washing hands often.They stopped short of calling for social distancing on planes due to the confined space, but added that other measures should be followed at all times.Meanwhile, Heathrow Airport will start using thermal cameras to carry out temperature checks in a trial on some passengers from its Terminal 2 on Thursday.Its chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, told the BBC's Today programme that this measure was already being used in many countries around the world.

Mastercard staff can work from home 'until ready',"Mastercard staff can continue working from home until they ""feel comfortable"" going to the office amid the pandemic.The credit card firm employs about 20,000 people globally, with a ""large percentage"" now working from home.Rather than forcing them back to offices, staff can make their own decision on timings, it said.Twitter said last week it would allow staff to work from home ""forever"" as a growing number of firms rethink work arrangements.""Today, a large percentage of our team is working remotely, even as most offices remain open,"" a Mastercard spokesman said.""At the end of the day, our employees will make the decision on when they feel comfortable returning to an office.

In an interview with the BBC's Asia Business Report, Mastercard's chief executive Ajay Banga said he thought that was still ""some time away"". ""I'm not planning on getting back to a pre-Covid growth scenario for another year.

VW pulls Instagram ads after racism row,"German car giant Volkswagen has withdrawn a series of social media adverts and apologised after a racism row.A controversial advert showed a dark-skinned man being manoeuvred around by a pair of white women's hands before being flicked away from a yellow VW Golf to a jaunty soundtrack.Volkswagen apologised, saying the advert was ""wrong and distasteful"".VW said it would investigate how the advert had been published.The advert was one in a series which was supposed to depict a love story between a dark-skinned man and a white woman.For example, one of the adverts showed the woman placing an envelope on the windscreen of the car to try to fool the man that he had a parking ticket, when in fact it was a letter from her.The series, which was set in Buenos Aires, was to promote the VW Golf 8. It was put up on Instagram and Facebook.The advert which caused the controversy showed the man, dressed in a suit, being manipulated by a very large pair of white hands over a soundtrack of a woman's laughter, upbeat music, and comedic sound effects.It was supposed to mimic videos put up on social media where one person appears to be controlling another like a puppet.The man is manoeuvred away from the yellow VW Golf and flicked into a café called ""Petit Colon"".The cafe is an actual location in Buenos Aires near the Teatro Colon, a theatre named after Christopher Columbus.However, the name ""Petit Colon"" translates both from French to English and from French to German as ""Little Settler"" or ""Little Colonist"".Twitter users also pointed out that when the German slogan ""Der Neue Golf"" (which means ""The New Golf"") fades in, the letters which fade in first spell out a word in German, ""neger"", which can be used as the German equivalent of the n-word.""Neger"" can be highly pejorative in German and is used as a racial slur.Initially VW responded to criticism on Instagram by saying that the origin of the people depicted was not relevant, and that it was ""surprised and shocked that our Instagram story could be so misunderstood"".However, it later backtracked, saying in a statement: ""We fully understand the disgust and anger in response to the video. It is quite clear that this video is wrong and distasteful. We firmly distance ourselves from the video and apologise sincerely.""It said that given its own history - the firm was set up by the Nazis prior to World War Two - ""Volkswagen has positioned itself as a company that does not tolerate any form of racism, xenophobia or discrimination.""The firm has a number of internal schemes designed to promote diversity and unprejudiced cooperation, it said, so it is ""all the more frustrating that we have made this mistake.""It added that it would ""investigate how this could have happened - and draw the necessary consequences"", which could include more checks and balances on its marketing.This is not the first time that Volkswagen has misjudged its messaging.In 2013 there was controversy in the US after the firm aired a Superbowl advert with the character of a white man from Minnesota, speaking with a Jamaican accent, exhorting colleagues to be more relaxed in their approach to life.In March 2019 Volkswagen chairman of the board Herbert Diess apologised after evoking a Nazi slogan to describe the importance of boosting the group's profits.And in August 2019 a VW advert, which showed men being adventurous as a woman sat by a pram, was banned under UK gender stereotyping rules.",20 May 2020,business
"Coronavirus: Rolls-Royce to cut 9,000 jobs amid virus crisis","Rolls-Royce has said it will cut 9,000 jobs and warned it will take ""several years"" for the airline industry to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.The Derby-based firm, which makes plane engines, said the reduction of nearly a fifth of its workforce would mainly affect its civil aerospace division.""This is not a crisis of our making. But it is the crisis that we face and must deal with,"" boss Warren East said.The bulk of the job cuts are expected to be in the UK at its site in Derby.Rolls-Royce employs 52,000 people globally and Mr East told the BBC's Today programme that the company had not yet concluded on ""exactly"" where the job losses would be, due to having to consult with unions.But he said: ""It's fair to say that of our civil aerospace business approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that's probably a good first proxy.""Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace business has a number of sites in the UK, but the largest plant is in Derby.The company said it will also carry out a review of its sites but declined to comment on which ones may close.John, a worker in Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace division who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said that while he expected there would be job cuts, the eventual 9,000 figure was ""a shock"".""Since the Covid-19 outbreak we knew that business would shrink,"" he said.But he said the scale of the cuts as well as the potential closure of some sites was a surprise. Unite the union said the decision was ""shameful opportunism"".""This company has accepted public money to furlough thousands of workers,"" said Unite's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner.""Unite and Britain's taxpayers deserve a more responsible approach to a national emergency.  We call upon Rolls-Royce to step back from the brink and work with us on a better way through this crisis.""Rolls-Royce initially furloughed 4,000 workers in the UK last month. Some 3,700 people remain on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme though which the government pays 80% of a worker's wage up to £2,500 a month.But Mr East said: ""No government can extend things like furlough schemes for years into the future. We have to look after ourselves and make sure we meet medium term demand.""This morning's job losses are hardly unexpected - airlines have cut their flying hours by 90% or more, and Airbus and Boeing have slashed their production numbers for the next few years - but they are still a heavy blow to one of the UK's few world-class manufacturing companies. While the details of where the cuts will fall have not been finalised, it is likely that two-thirds will go in the UK.The company has already used the government's furlough scheme to help pay the wages of about 4,000 staff, but Warren East, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, said companies could not expect the government to continue such a scheme for several years. There was also a clear hint this morning that some factories may close - the company said it would review its future manufacturing footprint.Some questions remain for Roll-Royce. Investors are scratching their head about when the company's revenues - much of which rely on aircraft to be flying for money to flow - will return.The company has not yet tapped its shareholders for more money - some expect that may eventually come.Air travel has ground to a virtual standstill since the coronavirus began spreading across the world and many airlines have announced steep job cuts.Global air traffic is expected to decline by 45% this year, according to investment bank Baird. It also forecasts that airlines are expected to lose $310bn (£253bn) in revenue in 2020.Rolls-Royce said the impact of the pandemic on the company and the whole of the aviation industry ""is unprecedented"".It added that it is ""increasingly clear that activity in the commercial aerospace market will take several years to return to the levels seen just a few months ago"". As well as the job losses, the company said it would cut costs in areas such as its plants and properties. It expects to make cost savings of £1.3bn.Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the aerospace industry association, said: ""The crisis is having a major impact on aerospace companies who provide high value, long-term jobs in all regions and nations of the UK, putting thousands more jobs at risk now and in the months ahead.""Do you work for Rolls-Royce?

J&J to sell baby powder in UK despite stopping US sales,"Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson says it will continue to sell its talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder in the UK and the rest of the world, despite stopping sales in the US and Canada.It said North American sales had shrunk partly because of a ""constant barrage"" of advertising by lawyers seeking clients to claim against the company.J&J has been at the centre of claims for years that its talc causes cancer.It has always strenuously defended the product's safety.Johnson & Johnson has been ordered to pay out billions of dollars in compensation, but has so far always successfully appealed against these verdicts.Almost 20,000 people in the US have so far lodged claims against the company.Talc is mined from the earth and is found in seams close to that of asbestos, a material known to cause cancer. The company said in a statement: ""Johnson & Johnson remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder.""It said ""decades"" of study by medical and legal experts around the world supported its view, and all verdicts against the company that had gone against it had been overturned on appeal. It will continue to sell its talc-based products in the US and Canada until stocks have sold out. It also sells a cornstarch-based powder which it will continue to sell in North America.It said both types of Johnson's baby powder, talc-based and cornstarch-based, will continue to be sold in other markets around the world where there is ""significantly higher"" consumer demand for the product.  The firm said changes in consumer behaviour had also dampened demand for the powder. The firm added that the move was also part of a reassessment of its consumer products prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.It said in October that its testing had found no asbestos in its baby powder after tests conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration discovered trace amounts.The firm is appealing against a 2018 order to pay $4.7bn (£3.6bn) in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc products caused them to develop ovarian cancer.",20 May 2020,business
Oil collapse: 'Right now everything I have is shut down',"The US rose over the last decade to become the world's largest oil producer. Does the pandemic spell the industry's decline?Texas oilman Allan P Bloxsom III still remembers the taunts of ""college boy"" that greeted him on the offshore drilling rig where his father, desperate for his wayward son to shape up, sent him to work one summer.""Against my wishes I went and it changed my life,"" says Mr Bloxsom, now 63 years old and the president of Fort Apache Energy, a small company that operates oil and gas wells in Texas and Louisiana. ""I was hooked.""That was decades ago. Since then, his home state of Texas has more than doubled its crude oil output, helping to turn the US into the world's biggest oil producer.But as oil prices tumble - briefly falling below zero in a first last month - following a dramatic drop in energy demand because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the industry is going into reverse.Giants such as Exxon and Chevron and fracking firms such as Diamondback Energy have shut in wells and slashed investment in recent weeks, helping drive down US crude oil production by nearly one million barrels per day from March to April - the third largest monthly decline in a century.Mr Bloxsom cut his typical output of 800 barrels per day by more than half. Others have gone even further.""Right now everything I have is shut down. Everything,"" says Bill D Graham, president of Midland, Texas-based Incline Energy, which has 80 wells that in more typical times would about 275 barrels per day. The supply cuts are not unique to the US. The International Energy Agency expects global oil supply to fall to a nine-year low this month, as producers around the world reduce output in response to prices that dropped by more than two-thirds in April before starting to stabilise.But even before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the industry was experiencing a supply glut - driven by the US boom - that had depressed prices and prompted strains in oil-producing Texas and elsewhere. The Wall Street money that helped power the fracking growth had grown harder to come by, while big firms were promoting investments in renewable energy. Forecasters at IHS Markit say supply is unlikely to return to 2019 levels until at least 2023. There is a chance that 2019 will have been the high point for global output, should the pandemic permanently reduce energy demand - for example, by increasing telework and reducing business travel.""This is a transformational crisis for the world and what happens to oil will be shaped by the broader forces of change that are coming out of Covid-19,"" says Jim Burkhard, the firm's head of oil market research.""There's enough of these variables in play where you don't have to have a doomsday view of the world to consider that oil demand could have peaked in 2019. That's not our base case, but it is our alternative scenario.""In the US, several large US companies have already filed for bankruptcy, with more expected in a sector where debt levels were already dangerously high. Services firms, desperate to survive the crisis, have cut more than 66,000 jobs - almost 10% of total employment - with more reductions likely, the Petroleum Equipment & Services Association industry group estimates. As healthier businesses scoop up the assets of distressed rivals, the industry is likely to emerge with fewer firms and fewer workers.""The future for the small operator like me - I see it going away completely,"" says Mr Graham.Mr Graham, whose father started Incline Energy in 1966, says he managed to keep his five staff after securing government coronavirus rescue money. But if the price his oil fetches - which for now is lower than figure traded on financial markets - does not bounce back above $25 by October, those jobs are at risk.""With the wells shut in and zero income, we're just going to have to play a waiting game and see how long we can last,"" the 66-year-old says.US President Donald Trump has pledged his support for the oil industry and opened government storage facilities, so that producers do not have to sell at a loss due to lack of storage as happened in April. The Federal Reserve has also adjusted its coronavirus relief programmes to make sure energy firms qualify. But Democrats, backed by environmental groups and others concerned about fossil fuel contributions to climate change, have resisted greater assistance for the sector, pointing to already high debt levels among many firms. ""It is deplorable to send good money after bad,"" Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, wrote after the Fed's changes.Leslie Beyer, president of industry group Petroleum Equipment & Services Association, says many of her members are already working on renewables and cleaner energy technology. She calls those who hope the pandemic will spell the demise of the industry ""misguided"", noting that global population growth and economic development in poor countries will drive continuing demand for oil.""Some people who don't understand the way the industry works ... think now is the time to transition entirely to renewables. There is definitely room for renewables and we need to increase those, but we don't go zero to 60,"" she says. ""It's important that we don't give up on the ingenuity that created the shale boom. That's what put us in the great position that we're in as the world's largest producer ... We need to maintain that.""But the best days of the industry may be over, Mr Bloxsom says, pointing to the scarcity of young people at conferences.""I have told all four of my kids, 'Do not go into the oil patch,"" he says. ""Do something else.""",20 May 2020,business
Dark web scammers exploit Covid-19 fear and doubt,"""They're exploiting the fear, uncertainty and doubt people are experiencing during the pandemic, and using the anxiety and desperation to get people to buy things or click on things they wouldn't have otherwise,"" says Morgan Wright, a former senior adviser to the US Department of State anti-terrorism assistance programme.He's talking about the scammers and criminals that inhabit the ""dark web"" who have found a new angle - anxiety over Covid-19.Mr Wright, who is now chief security adviser at security software company SentinelOne, used to teach behavioural analysts at the US National Security Agency (NSA) about the exploitation of human behaviour. He is now seeing some of those techniques being used on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet that can be accessed using popular networks such as Tor.The Tor browser is privacy-focused, meaning it can obscure who is using it and what data is being accessed. It offers bad actors a way to operate with a degree of impunity, as law enforcement find it much more difficult to track down criminals that use it.Tor is a way to access the internet that requires software, known as the Tor browser, to use it.The name is an acronym for The Onion Router. Just as there are many layers to the vegetable, there are many layers of encryption on the network.It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and continues to receive funding from the US State Department.It attempts to hide a person's location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several ""nodes"" - which, in this context, means using volunteers' PCs and computer servers as connection points.Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity.To the website that ultimately receives the request, it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain - known as an ""exit node"" - rather than the person responsible.Since the beginning of the global pandemic, marketplaces on the dark web have seen a rise in Covid-19 related products and services. Sought-after N95 masks, gowns, gloves and the drug chloroquine have all been listed on these marketplaces. Last month, security software firm IntSights found blood allegedly belonging to recovered coronavirus patients was even being offered for sale. Criminals hope a heightened sense of fear will make people rush to buy these products, and as a result these items are not cheap; an Australian Institute of Criminology report found the average fake vaccine was being sold for about $370 (£300), while one supposedly sourced from China was selling for between $10-15,000 (£8-12,000).One of the reasons for the rise in such sales may be because many fraudsters are having to turn from their normal methods of making money on the dark web - such as selling fake flights booked using stolen airmiles - because these industries are currently dormant. Many criminals also see an opportunity - as the majority of people are working from home, there is a greater chance of lax cyber security in place. ""There was suddenly a huge shift [on the dark web] of talking about vulnerabilities in collaboration software when they realised people were going to be working from home,"" says IntSights chief security officer Etay Maor. More Technology of BusinessPhishing scams have also been on the rise. These are where fraudsters pretend to be a different organisation or person by email, hoping the person will provide some login details or personal data, which can then be used to steal money or someone's identity. ""The phishing attacks started with those pretending to be from the NHS, and then extended to secondary organisations that are related to Covid-19 like banks or HMRC emailing about funding, grants or being furloughed,"" says Javvad Malik, security advocate at training company KnowBe4.""Now there are Covid-19 related phishing templates making their way into all of the phishing kits that are available on the dark web - meaning people can imitate Apple or LinkedIn with a set of standard templates,"" he adds.In addition, many services and products, including phishing kits are being offered at discount in ""coronavirus sales"".""There are people who have been specialising in phishing pages, shady VPNs or spamming services for a number of years, who are now offering discounts because they believe it's the best time to make money and spread these kits,"" says Liv Rowley, threat intelligence analyst at Blueliv, a computer and network security firm.The dark web was designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, with the idea of enabling human rights activists and people within the military to talk and collaborate in a secure, anonymous way. While the introduction of bitcoin enabled criminals to make money on the dark web, there remains a huge number of users that opt to use it for its initial purpose - speaking to others anonymously on forums.According to Mr Malik, these forums have often been used to fuel conspiracy theories around the virus.""Conspiracies about 5G being the vehicle of this virus, or bioweaponry or that Bill Gates is the man behind it tend to crop up on the dark web,"" he says.As social media companies and other news outlets crack down on misinformation, many others may be pushed onto the dark web. These forums often act as a gateway to marketplaces, for people to plug their products or services to a targeted audience. This could be a way for fraudsters to make further money in the months to come. The flipside to this is that many journalists, activists and citizens may be using the dark web to communicate in countries where there is a lot of censorship. Tor versions of many news outlets, including the BBC and New York Times, may be used if the original sites are blocked by governments or states, for instance. Netblocks, a digital rights advocacy group says that many countries have cut access to the web in different ways, as they seek to control the flow of information about the coronavirus outbreak.Two ransomware groups had said they would not attack any hospitals or healthcare organisations during the pandemic, but as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab outlined in a recent press briefing, there is evidence that criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations that are responding to the pandemic - including hospitals.""These organisations are targeted because of how vulnerable they are at this time and because of the likelihood that a ransom would be paid,"" says Charity Wright, cyber threat intelligence adviser at IntSights.The co-ordination and orchestration of many of these attacks often begin on the dark web.""We are seeing more offerings on the dark web specifically for healthcare-related information and for targeting healthcare facilities and doctors. There's even a database someone has created on the dark web with all kinds of information about medical staff,"" says Etay Maor from IntSights. At its core, the dark web may still be being used for the same reasons it was intended to be used for - from a privacy and security perspective. But criminals are using this to try to exploit a global crisis for financial gain.""That's the double-edged sword that as a society we haven't quite worked out: how do we safeguard freedom of speech and ensure privacy, but at the same time track down and stop people abusing those freedoms?"" says Javvad Malik.

"The man who bought 60,000 oil and gas wells","The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Rusty Hutson Jr, founder and chief executive of US energy firm Diversified Gas & Oil (DGO).In the end, Rusty Hutson Jr couldn't escape the calling of the family trade.Born and raised in a blue-collar household in the oil and gas fields of West Virginia, his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all earned their livings in the energy sector.They worked at the wells, and on the pipelines, putting in a hard shift of manual labour, day after day, year after year, to provide for their families.During his summer holidays from high school and then college, Rusty would go to work with his dad.But when he became the first Hutson to graduate from university, in 1991, he decided he wanted to do something completely different with his life.""I decided that going into oil and gas was about the last thing I wanted to do,"" he says. ""I didn't want a part of it when I got out. It's really hard work.""So armed with an accountancy degree from West Virginia's Fairmont State University he went off to have a successful banking career for the next decade, ending up in Birmingham, Alabama.But as the years progressed, Rusty says it started to nag at him that he hadn't followed his dad into the family industry.""West Virginia was a tough state when I was growing up. Still is,"" he says. ""And there were two kinds of people - you either worked in coal, or you worked in oil and gas. It was a generational thing - if your dad and grandfather did it for a living, then you did it.""And as the years progressed I increasingly felt drawn back to that world. I also had this desire to build something, to do something entrepreneurial.""So in 2001, aged 32, Rusty bought an old gas well back in West Virginia for $250,000 (£200,000). He raised the money by remortgaging his home.""It was a small old well, it had been in production for years, but it was like gold to me,"" he says. ""I spent the next four years still also working in the bank, but any spare time I had I'd fly up to West Virginia to work alongside the one well tender that I had back then.""Fast-forward to today, and Rusty's company, DGO, now owns more than 60,000 gas and oil wells across West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, a region called the Appalachia. Employing 925 people it has annual revenues of more than $500m. Some 90% of its operation is natural gas, with 10% oil.The company's business model is a very specific one - it doesn't do any drilling to find new oil and gas reserves. Instead it buys up old oil and gas wells that bigger producers no longer want, because the initial large flow levels have fallen to low volumes.""They don't want these old wells, but the average remaining life on most of these wells is 50 years,"" he says. ""So we can come in, run them very efficiently, and make money.""Rusty says that DGO has been greatly helped by the so-called ""dash for shale"" in the US over the past decade, whereby oil and gas firms gave up traditional oil and gas wells to switch to fracking instead.In very simple terms, unlike traditional wells where oil and gas is sucked up, fracking involves first injecting a high pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals into shale rock. This fractures the rock, and allows the removal of vast quantities of oil and gas that wasn't previously accessible.Rusty says the industry-wide move to fracking, and its higher production volumes, meant that DGO has been able to buy thousands of old, but still productive, traditional wells cheaply, and rapidly expand the business.To help raise funds for continuing expansion, in 2017 the company decided to go public and sell its shares on a stock exchange. In an unusual move for a US firm, Rusty chose the London Stock Exchange's (LSE's) Alternative Investment Market.""We weren't big enough at the time to float in the US,"" he says. ""And I didn't want to go down the private equity route because I didn't want to work for somebody else, and try to earn back some of the percentage.""More The Boss features:DGO is now in the process of moving up to the Main Market of the LSE.Energy sector analyst James McCormack of Cenkos Securities says that DGO's strategy of ""acquiring low-cost, long-life, low-decline [oil and gas] production"" is ""a virtually unique proposition"". He adds: ""Under Rusty's leadership, DGO has grown rapidly since its IPO (initial public offering) in February 2017, increasing production 20 times and reserves 23 times.""Fellow energy analyst Carlos Gomes of Edison says that DGO is now the largest conventional gas producer in the Appalachia region. ""The company possesses long-life, low operational cost, mature producing assets that generate very stable cash flows,"" he adds.The long-term plan at DGO is to keep buying wells to replace any that eventually come to the end of production, and Rusty says the firm is now looking to expand into other regions, such as down in Texas.In the more immediate term, he says that he is relaxed about the big falls in oil and gas prices since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, both because he has long-term ""hedges"" or agreements in place on what price he sells his production for, and because his business operates more efficiently than its larger rivals.He can also turn to his dad for help and advice. His father, Rusty Sr, is the supervisor for the company's northern West Virginia operation.""He's 72 and he just absolutely loves it,"" says Rusty. ""Does he try to tell me what to do? Oh, absolutely.""",18 May 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Facebook's Zuckerberg defends actions on virus misinformation,"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has told the BBC that it had and would remove any content likely to result in ""immediate and imminent harm"" to users. ""Even if something isn't going to lead to imminent physical harm, we don't want misinformation to be the content that is going viral,"" he said. It removed Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's claim that scientists had ""proved"" there was a coronavirus cure.This was removed because it was ""obviously"" not true, he said. He also said that Facebook had removed content from groups claiming that the rollout of the 5G digital network was a cause of the spread of the virus and in some cases encouraged those who believed that to damage the networks physical infrastructure. Facebook recently removed content from former broadcaster and conspiracy theorist David Icke for ""repeatedly violating our policies on harmful misinformation"". Mr Icke had suggested that 5G mobile phone networks are linked to the spread of the virus and in another video he suggested a Jewish group was behind the virus.Mr Zuckerberg said: ""We work with independent fact checkers. Since the Covid outbreak, they have issued 7,500 notices of misinformation which has led to us issuing 50 million warning labels on posts. ""We know these are effective because 95% of the time, users don't click through to the content with a warning label.""However, Facebook has insisted that unless there was the prospect of real imminent harm, then the company would and should allow what he called the ""widest possible aperture"" for freedom of expression on the internet.He also told the BBC that preventing electoral interference is an ""arms race"" against countries such as Russia, Iran and China.He admitted that the firm was ""behind"" in the 2016 US presidential election.In his first UK broadcast interview in five years, he said that Facebook had been unprepared for state-sponsored interference in 2016.But he added the company was confident it had since learnt its lessons.Facebook was previously embroiled in a political scandal in which tens of millions of its users' data ended up in the hands of political interest groups including Cambridge Analytica.However, he said the social media giant, which also owns Whatsapp and Instagram, was now better prepared than other companies, and even governments, to prevent future attempts to influence political outcomes.""Countries are going to continue to try and interfere and we are going to see issues like that but we have learnt a lot since 2016 and I feel pretty confident that we are going to be able to protect the integrity of the upcoming election"".Mr Zuckerberg also defended his level of personal control over arguably the world's most powerful media platforms.Although Facebook is a public company worth nearly $700bn (£574bn), he ultimately exerts total individual control thanks to an ownership structure that gives him a controlling interest even though he owns a small fraction of the shares.He said it had allowed Facebook to make longer-term strategic decisions which have proved to be correct such as waiting to improve the Facebook experience before launching it on smartphones and not selling out early to rivals.""If it had been different then we would have sold out to Yahoo years ago and who knows what would have happened then. ""Yahoo is now worth 1/20th as much as Facebook.Facebook continues to face criticism over its reluctance to describe or define itself as a publisher and thus embrace the kind of editorial responsibility that newspapers and traditional broadcasters are legally bound by.However, it would be hard to argue that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have not provided billions of people with the kind of connectivity with friends and family that has been important during this global pandemic and the consequent restrictions on movement and freedom.In fact, after many years of courting controversy and opprobrium, it seems clear that Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg are feeling more confident about their public roles.If there are any winners out of this public health emergency, digital companies like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon are among them.However, no one is totally immune to the deep downturn that is already upon us and the evidence for which is confirmed with every new economic release.Facebook knows that and is one of the reasons it is keen to help small businesses online through this week's launch of a service called Facebook Shops.It's a mutually beneficial exchange. Those businesses are Facebook's current and future customers. What's good for them is good for Facebook.",21 May 2020,business
Mastercard staff can work from home 'until ready',"Mastercard staff can continue working from home until they ""feel comfortable"" going to the office amid the pandemic.The credit card firm employs about 20,000 people globally, with a ""large percentage"" now working from home.Rather than forcing them back to offices, staff can make their own decision on timings, it said.Twitter said last week it would allow staff to work from home ""forever"" as a growing number of firms rethink work arrangements.""Today, a large percentage of our team is working remotely, even as most offices remain open,"" a Mastercard spokesman said.""At the end of the day, our employees will make the decision on when they feel comfortable returning to an office. They know their personal circumstances and needs"". Tech giants Facebook and Google have also relaxed back-to-office policies and say they will let employees to continue working from home for the rest of the year. While about 90% of Mastercard's employees are working from home, this may go down once there is adequate testing and a vaccine is found, it said. In an interview with the BBC's Asia Business Report, Mastercard's chief executive Ajay Banga said he thought that was still ""some time away"". ""I'm not planning on getting back to a pre-Covid growth scenario for another year. I think that could be sometime next year when a vaccine is readily available and readily distributed.""Mastercard said it was also looking at consolidating some of its offices. It has created a ""future of work"" task force that is figuring out how best to handle employee needs and real estate amid the coronavirus crisis. The company has its headquarters New York, but also has regional hubs in Dubai, Singapore and Brussels.UK bank Barclays has also questioned the need for having thousands of its workers in big and expensive city offices. This ""may be a thing of the past"", its chief executive Jes Staley said last month.About 70,000 of Barclays' staff worldwide are working from home due to coronavirus lockdown measures which has led to a rethink of the bank's long-term ""location strategy"", Mr Staley said.Mastercard employees who work in its offices must now follow social distancing rules, wear face masks and undergo temperature checks.""One day, I think probably aided by a vaccine, and the ability therefore for the workers and consumers to get the confidence they need, we can get back to thinking about a pre-Covid kind of growth stage,"" said Mr Banga.  ""I still think that's some time away.""",21 May 2020,business
US Senate passes bill that could delist some Chinese firms,"The US Senate has passed a bill that could block some Chinese companies from selling shares on American stock exchanges.It would require overseas firms to follow US standards for audits and other financial regulations.The measure now has to be passed by the House of Representatives before being signed into law by President Trump.It comes as US-China tensions increase over the virus pandemic and after the Luckin Coffee accounting scandal.The planned legislation would also require publicly traded companies to reveal whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.The bill applies to all foreign companies, but is targeted at China, and follows intense criticism of Beijing by Mr Trump and other US politicians.Mr Trump and officials in his administration argue that China mishandled the coronavirus outbreak in its early stages.The outbreak has now grown to become a pandemic that has killed almost 330,000 people worldwide and crippled the global economy.US-listed Chinese companies have already come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.The company said its own investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of last year to the fourth quarter amounted to about 2.2bn yuan ($310m; £254m). That equates to about 40% of its estimated annual sales.The Chinese coffee chain has since sacked its chief executive and chief operating officer, while six other employees who were alleged to have been involved in or known about the transactions have been suspended or put on leave.The scandal-hit firm has said it has been co-operating with regulators in the US and China, who have begun an investigation into the company.Luckin's Nasdaq listing had been one of China's few successful US stock market debuts of 2019.On Tuesday Luckin said the Nasdaq exchange had notified the company of plans to delist it due to concerns over the alleged fabricated sales and disclosure failures. Its shares will trade on the exchange pending the outcome of an appeal, expected within 45 days.The scandal-hit firm's shares, which had been suspended since 7 April, plunged by more than 35% after they resumed trading on Wednesday.",21 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Universities fear fall in lucrative overseas students,"Which sector of the economy do you think is being hardest hit by the coronavirus - construction, retail, transport or catering?Well, you are all wrong, and need to do some more homework. The answer is - education.Many people probably don't even think of education as part of the economy. The groves of academe are surely above such sordid considerations as money and finance?Not a bit of it. Money is the lifeblood of education - endowments from wealthy alumni, catering and accommodation fees, conference facilities, and the biggest of the lot - attracting lots of fee-paying students every year. The trouble for the education sector is that it is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic.For hundreds of years its business model has been to bring thousands of people together from across the country, and around the world, to sit together in rooms for three years and talk to each other.As a result, nearly all its income streams are under attack at the same time.Current students have been sent home, and many courses have moved online. If lockdowns around the world continue, new students are going to be hard to find in the autumn, and even harder to get on campus.Plus, conferences are not happening, and all those wealthy alumni are nowhere near as wealthy as they thought they were.This hits Western English-speaking universities particularly hard. They tend to charge even domestic students large tuition fees, and make money out of on-site catering and accommodation on top of that.They also tend to charge foreign students a lot more, making them a huge source of income for many universities. In the UK, for example, undergraduate students from outside the UK and the EU can be charged annual tuition fees as high as £58,600 instead of the standard £9,000.So, while globalisation for many means importing cheaper manufactured goods from around the world, for developed economies one of their greatest recent economic successes has been attracting students from overseas.The rise of the middle classes around the world has been a godsend for Western universities, says Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at the University of Oxford.""The global middle classes have grown by leaps and bounds in recent decades, and anyone in that group can send their children abroad for education,"" he says.They have been doing just that, not least because many developing countries don't have the same quality of tertiary education as developed ones. This means that students who study abroad emerge with a prestigious degree, a second language, and lots of contacts and friends. It has proved a price worth paying for millions.The big winners in this regard have been the US, the UK and Australia. All with excellent education systems that teach in English, they can attract fee paying students from around the world.In the US, 360,000 Chinese students started the last academic year. The influx of foreign students is estimated to be worth as much as $45bn (£37bn) a year to the American economy.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:In Australia, foreign students are said to bring in more than 30bn Australian dollars a year ($20bn; £16bn), and it is a market that Australian universities have been targeting for years.Andrew Norton, professor of the practice of higher education policy at Australian National University in Canberra, says the country has been trying to attract foreign students from Asia since the 1980s.Australia has some distinct advantages for these students, he says. ""We are in much the same time zone, the climate is attractive, and there is the possibility of migrating here.""But the government in Canberra has not helped the sector very much, if at all, during this crisis. Prime Minister Scott Morrison even went as far as saying that foreign students should consider going back to their home countries if they could not support themselves during the lockdown.That message is hardly likely to encourage new students to feel welcome in future, and that matters, says Prof Norton, because ""there is a pipeline effect"".""If students don't start a degree course this year, then they are not here for three years,"" he says, meaning universities are going to be feeling the pressure of lost income for years to come, and not only in Australia.In the US the university sector is a massive business. Some of the oldest and most famous colleges have billions in reserve, massive endowments, and a reputation that means they can charge students top dollar. But even they are suffering being closed now.Many overseas students in the US are demanding rebates for lost lessons, and American universities make a small fortune from having students on site. Catering and accommodation are huge earners. Students in the UK have also been calling for refunds.Vijay Govindarajan, Coxe distinguished professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, says: ""I don't see how we can reopen and have campus classes this fall [autumn]"".Professor Marginson says that while universities have rushed to move courses online, at least temporarily, it is clear that they are not as attractive. ""Students, if given the choice, pick face-to-face teaching,"" he says. ""Online does not have the same prestige, and not just with employers, but with society as well.""In the UK, Cambridge University has announced that all its lectures will be online-only during the next academic year. However, it said it would review the situation if government guidance changed.  Colleges and universities around the world have moved rapidly towards online and remote teaching now, because they have to. When much of the world is in lockdown and social distancing is the norm, they have no choice, and it is the only way of keeping at least some money coming in.But it is not clear how many universities will survive the collapse of their income, and whether the move online will become permanent. Teaching people together on one site has proved to be a very long-lasting and successful business model, and it still carries huge prestige and rewards for those taking part.",21 May 2020,business
