'I'm living on cards': The firms waiting for emergency loans,"Businesses are still struggling to access government-backed loans from their banks.

""They seem to have a technical fault.""She's not alone, even though it is nearly two weeks since the launch of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) to prop up stricken small businesses.Hundreds of thousands of applications have been approved, but BBC News has seen a string of complaints about leading banks, including Santander, HSBC and Barclays, from customers who have been unable to get any money.Ms Solanki has built a reputation providing cosmetic tattooing, for people whose appearance is affected by surgery or conditions such as alopecia.But in March she had to shut her clinic in Finchley in North London, furloughing her four staff.She used the government grant for 80% of their wages but topped them up to 100%, which has added to the cost of keeping the business alive. So she applied for the loan through Barclays.""Barclays seem overloaded,"" she says, ""They have just not been able to deliver.""Ms Solanki tried to have her overdraft expanded, but that failed. She tried to get a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan from the bank, but that did not come through.Now Bounce Back Loans - interest free for a year - seem to be out of her reach as well, even though they are fully backed by the government, so the bank cannot lose.Barclays customers have told BBC News that they have had to wait hours on the phone to the bank trying to get applications started.Some have been told, incorrectly, that their personal details were wrongly entered. Others that having two signatories on their business account is a problem.Barclays told the BBC that 95% of customers who have applied have received their funds and that it was working hard to help customers who have fallen through the cracks. Maria Ogden, who runs a vehicle hire company in Oswestry, in Shropshire, has also been waiting for one of the emergency loans, in her case from Santander.""I've got vehicles on finance, insurance, rent - and people knocking on the door for payments,"" she says, ""but we can't earn any money."" Ms Ogden's business is allowed to stay open during the pandemic but she has hardly any customers and has furloughed her staff.She wants the maximum £50,000 Bounce Back Loan as well. But after she applied on 5th May, the day after the launch, she is still waiting to hear back. ""I've banked with them for years. What's the delay?"" she asks.Like Ms Solanki, Ms Ogden says she tried to get the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan, then switched to the Bounce Back option because it was supposed to be easier and quicker.""All my time this last week has been spent on the phone, on emails, trying to find out about this loan, instead of spending it working out how to help the business,"" Ms Ogden says.

US targets Huawei with tighter chip export rules,"The US has announced new export controls aimed at limiting Chinese technology giant Huawei's access to semiconductor technology. The new rule bars semiconductor-makers that use US technology and software in chip design from shipping to Huawei without US government permission.It is the latest US action to target Huawei, which US officials view as a national security threat.China threatened to retaliate against US tech firms.The tightened controls come a year after the US moved to cut off Huawei, the world's second largest smart phone maker, from access to US-made semiconductor chips, which form the backbone of most computer and phone systems.In response, the company and others in China accelerated efforts to manufacture such chips domestically.US Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross said that those efforts were ""still dependent on US technologies"", and accused Huawei of taking steps ""to undermine"" earlier export controls.""This is not how a responsible corporate citizen behaves,"" Mr Ross said. ""We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei... and prevent US technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to US national security and foreign policy interests.""The new US rule, to be published on Friday, applies to foreign-made items, using US technology. It exempts equipment or software made or shipped within the next 120 days - a move meant to limit economic harm. In a background briefing for reporters, the US said officials would consider licence applications to do business with Huawei on a ""case by case"" basis.""This is a licensing requirement. It does not necessarily mean that things are denied,"" a senior State Department official said. ""We tend to approach Huawei with some concern but this is a measure that gives the US government visibility into what is moving."" Also on Friday, the US extended waivers that allow US companies, many of them rural internet providers, to use some kinds of Huawei technology for another 90 days.Donald Trump, who is campaigning for re-election in November, has stepped up his attacks on China in recent weeks, blaming it for the spread of Covid-19. This week, he moved to restrict US government pension funds from investing in Chinese companies. He said on Wednesday he could ""cut off the whole relationship"".The US has said Huawei's technology could be used for spying by the Chinese government.It has pressured allies, including the UK and Germany, to bar Huawei from their networks and sued the company for technology theft and doing business with Iran, in violation of US sanctions.Huawei has contested the US government's claims and said American efforts are likely to backfire, hurting the ability of US tech firms to do business.China on Friday threatened to place US companies on an ""unreliable entity list"", according to a report in the country's Global Times.As well as putting pressure on its microchip business, the US trade blacklist has made life very difficult for Huawei's smartphone business.The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Huawei's handset shipments outside of China had dropped by 35%, threatening its position as the world's second-biggest handset maker.Its latest phones can no longer embed Google Mobile Services, which include important features such as maps and the Google Play app store.Huawei has tried to work its way around this by providing its own Huawei Mobile Services. But its App Gallery is missing a majority of the most-popular apps found on Android in the UK and US.Luckily, Huawei may have found a loophole.It has been re-releasing some of its previous smartphones with ever-so-slightly updated hardware, complete with the Google Mobile Services. Its latest is the P30 Pro New Edition. It looks almost just like the original P30 Pro, which was released before the US trade blacklist. But the New Edition has more memory and storage - and now comes in silver.

Government backtracks on French quarantine exemption,"The government has denied that travellers from France will be exempted from the planned coronavirus quarantine measures.Under the plans announced last weekend, people arriving from abroad must isolate themselves for two weeks. Those with nowhere to stay will be obliged to isolate in accommodation provided by the authorities.Initially, a joint statement from the British and French governments said no quarantine measures would apply.""No quarantine measures would apply to travellers coming from France at this stage; any measures on either side would be taken in a concerted and reciprocal manner,"" says the statement, which was published on the government's website on 10 May.""A working group between the two governments will be set up to ensure this consultation throughout the coming weeks.""The policy attracted a warning from the EU not to single out one nation, while some experts suggested it would prove unworkable.  But today, the prime minister's spokesman insisted there was no French exemption, and that the original statement referred to the need for cooperation to manage the common border between the two countries. It now appears that those exempted from the policy could include freight drivers, in order to allow the flow of goods to continue, and people working on Covid-19 research, but not ordinary travellers. The government had already indicated that people arriving from the Republic of Ireland will not be made to go into quarantine, an arrangement that will be unaffected by today's news.However, the measures will apply to UK holidaymakers returning from other destinations.In his address to the nation on Sunday, the prime minister said: ""I am serving notice that it will soon be the time - with transmission significantly lower - to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air.""The government later clarified that the rules would apply not just to air passengers, but also those arriving by other means of travel such as train or ferry.Following Mr Johnson's speech, No 10 confirmed a reciprocal deal with the government in Paris meant restrictions would not apply to passengers from France, but that was ahead of today's apparent u-turn.",15 May 2020,business
Coronavirus pushes German economy into recession,"Germany's economy shrank by 2.2% in the first three months of this year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed it into recession, official figures indicate.It was the biggest quarterly fall since 2009, when the country was engulfed in the global financial crisis.The figures from the Federal Statistics Office come as Germany takes its first tentative steps to exit lockdown.Shops are reopening, pupils will gradually return to class and football is restarting behind closed doors.At the same time, figures for the final three months of 2019 were revised to show a contraction of 0.1%.That means German GDP growth has been negative for two successive quarters, the technical definition of a recession.The figures are in line with market expectations, says BBC global trade correspondent Dharshini David.The German economy was already lacklustre before the onset of the pandemic, as the US-China trade war cast a shadow over activity, our correspondent points out.The statistics office warned that the figures were subject to extreme uncertainty, with the next estimate due out on 25 May.Germany is Europe's largest economy, but the drop is not as bad as in some of its neighbours, such as France, which has seen a decline of 5.8%, and Italy, which reported a 4.7% fall. This effect is partly due to a decision by Germany's 16 states to allow factories and construction sites to stay open, as well as an unprecedented rescue package by the government.Economists expect a deeper slump in the second quarter of the year, as the full effects of the lockdown become apparent.Germany, along with just about every other economy on the planet, has been hit by the combination of official restrictions on movement and commercial activity, as well as by personal choices to avoid the risk of infection. Consumer spending was down and so was investment (apart from construction which, along with government spending, softened the economic blow). Germany is a big power in global trade and imports and exports were both lower. It was a sharp contraction overall, but so far at least, the blows to the German economy have not generally been as severe as those suffered by the rest of the eurozone. The other three largest economies - France, Italy and Spain - were all hit much harder by the health crisis and have seen much larger declines in the first three months of 2020. For the quarter now under way, Germany will take a hit, but it has an advantage compared to those others. Tourism is a smaller part of the economy and it's a sector that is facing an extremely challenging 2020 summer season. Separate growth figures released by EU statistics office Eurostat for the eurozone as a whole confirmed an earlier estimate showing a record decline of 3.8% in the January-to-March period.For the 27-nation EU, the equivalent figure was 3.3%.Eurostat also issued figures showing a 0.2% fall in eurozone employment, the first such decline since 2013.""The German economy has been tiptoeing on the edge of recession since the beginning of 2019, but it can hide no longer,"" said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.""The German business cycle expansion, which started in 2013, ended decisively in Q1, and more pain is ahead in the near term before the recovery.""",15 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: WTO head steps down a year early as downturn looms,"The head of the World Trade Organization has said he will step down a year earlier than planned, at a crucial moment for the global economy.Roberto Azevedo's surprise departure comes as the WTO faces the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and criticism from US President Donald Trump.Global trade has slumped and the world is braced for the worst downturn since the Great Depression.Meanwhile, Mr Trump has accused the body of treating America unfairly.Mr Azevedo said his early departure as the WTO's director-general was a ""personal decision"" that was in the best interests of the organisation.""The WTO may not be perfect, but it is indispensable all the same. It is what keeps us from a world where the law of the jungle prevails, at least as far as trade is concerned.""The Trump administration has repeatedly accused the global trade watchdog of having strayed from its purpose to liberalise and protect markets, and that conditions around China's entry into the organisation in 2001 have led to millions of American job losses.Asked about Mr Azevedo's exit, Mr Trump, who had previously said the US would leave the organisation if it didn't change, said he was ""OK with it"".""We've been treated very badly... They treat China as a developing nation. Therefore China gets a lot of the benefits that the US doesn't get,"" he added.Mr Azevedo's departure comes at an especially difficult time for the WTO, with global trade expected to slump to historic lows as measures to slow the spread of Covid-19 shut down economic activity around the world.At the same time the Geneva-based body last year saw one of its main functions, arbitrating trade disputes, hobbled by the US.Washington's dispute with the WTO has seen it block the appointment of judges to the organisation's top court, called the Appellate Body, since December 2019. It means it has too few officials to rule on major trade disputes between countries.Along with the US, other WTO members, including Japan and the European Union, have pushed for the WTO to make far-reaching reforms. They argue that global trading rules need to reflect new realities, notably the rise of China as a powerful economy, and address problems such as state subsidies and forced technology transfers.",15 May 2020,business
Coronavirus 'could cost global economy $8.8tn' says ADB,"The coronavirus pandemic could cost the global economy between $5.8tn and $8.8tn (£4.7tn-£7.1tn), according to Asian Development Bank (ADB).That's more than double last month's prediction and equates to 6.4%-9.7% of the world's economic output.It comes as measures to slow the spread of Covid-19 continue to paralyse economic activity around the world.Globally authorities have taken aggressive action to cushion their economies from the outbreak's impact.""This new analysis presents a broad picture of the very significant potential economic impact of Covid-19,"" the ADB's chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada said.""It also highlights the important role policy interventions can play to help mitigate damage to economies,"" he added.The ADB said the top end of the range was based on the assumption that curbs to movement and businesses operating would last six months, while the bottom end assumed the restrictions would remain in place for three months.Central banks around the world have moved aggressively to cut interest rates and roll out massive stimulus measures to help combat the impact of the outbreak that has rocked financial markets and raised fears of a deep global recession.Yesterday new figures showed the huge impact of Covid-19 on the world's biggest economy as the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits jumped by almost 3 million last week. Nearly a quarter of the US workforce is now claiming some form of benefits. Earlier this week the chairman of the US Federal Reserve warned that America's economic recovery is likely to be slower than initially hoped.Jerome Powell cautioned that the US faces a slow and painful economic recovery without more government relief.At the same time it was estimated that the UK government's efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic has risen to £123.2bn.The Office for Budget Responsibility said it now expects annual borrowing to equal 15.2% of the UK economy, with increased cost of the government's furlough scheme being the main cause for the increase.",15 May 2020,business

Coronavirus pushes German economy into recession,"Germany's economy shrank by 2.2% in the first three months of this year as the coronavirus pandemic pushed it into recession, official figures indicate.It was the biggest quarterly fall since 2009, when the country was engulfed in the global financial crisis.The figures from the Federal Statistics Office come as Germany takes its first tentative steps to exit lockdown.Shops are reopening, pupils will gradually return to class and football is restarting behind closed doors.At the same time, figures for the final three months of 2019 were revised to show a contraction of 0.1%.That means German GDP growth has been negative for two successive quarters, the technical definition of a recession.The figures are in line with market expectations, says BBC global trade correspondent Dharshini David.The German economy was already lacklustre before the onset of the pandemic, as the US-China trade war cast a shadow over activity, our correspondent points out.The statistics office warned that the figures were subject to extreme uncertainty, with the next estimate due out on 25 May.Germany is Europe's largest economy, but the drop is not as bad as in some of its neighbours, such as France, which has seen a decline of 5.8%, and Italy, which reported a 4.7% fall. This effect is partly due to a decision by Germany's 16 states to allow factories and construction sites to stay open, as well as an unprecedented rescue package by the government.Economists expect a deeper slump in the second quarter of the year, as the full effects of the lockdown become apparent.Germany, along with just about every other economy on the planet, has been hit by the combination of official restrictions on movement and commercial activity, as well as by personal choices to avoid the risk of infection. Consumer spending was down and so was investment (apart from construction which, along with government spending, softened the economic blow). Germany is a big power in global trade and imports and exports were both lower. It was a sharp contraction overall, but so far at least, the blows to the German economy have not generally been as severe as those suffered by the rest of the eurozone. The other three largest economies - France, Italy and Spain - were all hit much harder by the health crisis and have seen much larger declines in the first three months of 2020.

Coronavirus: WTO head steps down a year early as downturn looms,"The head of the World Trade Organization has said he will step down a year earlier than planned, at a crucial moment for the global economy.Roberto Azevedo's surprise departure comes as the WTO faces the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and criticism from US President Donald Trump.Global trade has slumped and the world is braced for the worst downturn since the Great Depression.Meanwhile, Mr Trump has accused the body of treating America unfairly.Mr Azevedo said his early departure as the WTO's director-general was a ""personal decision"" that was in the best interests of the organisation.""The WTO may not be perfect, but it is indispensable all the same.

US targets Huawei with tighter chip export rules,"The US has announced new export controls aimed at limiting Chinese technology giant Huawei's access to semiconductor technology. The new rule bars semiconductor-makers that use US technology and software in chip design from shipping to Huawei without US government permission.It is the latest US action to target Huawei, which US officials view as a national security threat.China threatened to retaliate against US tech firms.The tightened controls come a year after the US moved to cut off Huawei, the world's second largest smart phone maker, from access to US-made semiconductor chips, which form the backbone of most computer and phone systems.In response, the company and others in China accelerated efforts to manufacture such chips domestically.US Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross said that those efforts were ""still dependent on US technologies"", and accused Huawei of taking steps ""to undermine"" earlier export controls.""This is not how a responsible corporate citizen behaves,"" Mr Ross said. ""We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei... and prevent US technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to US national security and foreign policy interests.""The new US rule, to be published on Friday, applies to foreign-made items, using US technology. It exempts equipment or software made or shipped within the next 120 days - a move meant to limit economic harm. In a background briefing for reporters, the US said officials would consider licence applications to do business with Huawei on a ""case by case"" basis.""This is a licensing requirement. It does not necessarily mean that things are denied,"" a senior State Department official said. ""We tend to approach Huawei with some concern but this is a measure that gives the US government visibility into what is moving."" Also on Friday, the US extended waivers that allow US companies, many of them rural internet providers, to use some kinds of Huawei technology for another 90 days.Donald Trump, who is campaigning for re-election in November, has stepped up his attacks on China in recent weeks, blaming it for the spread of Covid-19. This week, he moved to restrict US government pension funds from investing in Chinese companies. He said on Wednesday he could ""cut off the whole relationship"".The US has said Huawei's technology could be used for spying by the Chinese government.It has pressured allies, including the UK and Germany, to bar Huawei from their networks and sued the company for technology theft and doing business with Iran, in violation of US sanctions.Huawei has contested the US government's claims and said American efforts are likely to backfire, hurting the ability of US tech firms to do business.China on Friday threatened to place US companies on an ""unreliable entity list"", according to a report in the country's Global Times.As well as putting pressure on its microchip business, the US trade blacklist has made life very difficult for Huawei's smartphone business.The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Huawei's handset shipments outside of China had dropped by 35%, threatening its position as the world's second-biggest handset maker.Its latest phones can no longer embed Google Mobile Services, which include important features such as maps and the Google Play app store.Huawei has tried to work its way around this by providing its own Huawei Mobile Services. But its App Gallery is missing a majority of the most-popular apps found on Android in the UK and US.Luckily, Huawei may have found a loophole.It has been re-releasing some of its previous smartphones with ever-so-slightly updated hardware, complete with the Google Mobile Services. Its latest is the P30 Pro New Edition. It looks almost just like the original P30 Pro, which was released before the US trade blacklist. But the New Edition has more memory and storage - and now comes in silver. And because it's technically a P30 Pro, rather than a P40 Pro, it also comes with the full suite of Google services.Huawei says it will be released in the UK on 3 June. How long it can use that work-around remains to be seen.",15 May 2020,business

One in four US workers claiming jobless benefits,"The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits jumped by almost 3 million last week as virus shutdowns continue to weigh on the US economy.The filings brought the total number of new jobless claims since the middle of March to more than 36 million.That amounts to nearly a quarter of the American workforce.The weekly figures have been falling since the end of March but remain massive by historic standards, eclipsing the prior record of 700,000.""Today's unemployment claims continue their epic ascent on a cumulative weekly basis; not since the Great Depression has the US job market been in such a sorry state,"" said Richard Flynn, UK managing director at Charles Schwab.The head of America's central bank warned this week that the economic recovery is likely to be slower than initially hoped.In April, employers cut more than 20 million jobs, sending the unemployment rate to 14.7% and erasing nearly a decade of job gains.

The increase in the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended 9 May was ""relatively modest"", noted Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.""With most states only beginning to ease their lockdowns over the last 10 days, we expect a much bigger swing in hiring versus firing over the next couple of weeks, which suggests the unemployment rate will begin to drop back,"" he said.This is the first time I've been unemployed since I was 14.

Coronavirus: LNER introduces mandatory ticket reservations,"East Coast train operator LNER is to introduce mandatory seat reservations on all train services from Monday.

LNER confirmed its shift to mandatory reservations in a tweet. This contained ""tips"" for passengers, travelling on its trains, including:The company concluded by asking: ""Can you travel another way? Help us keep the trains clear for those who really need them.""LNER said passengers would have to make a seat reservation if they have a flexible ticket that does not have a reservation, or if they are a season ticket holder.Customers will not be charged for making a reservation.Existing seat reservations are still valid, but will no longer be linked to a specific seat number. LNER said it was asking passengers to choose their own seat on board the train.  A spokesperson said: ""The safety of our staff and customers is always our top priority. To support social distancing for customers who do need to travel with us at this time, all LNER services will be reservation only from Monday 18 May 2020. ""We will have full details updated on our website over the weekend.

There will also be enhanced cleaning procedures on board trains and at stations, focusing especially on cleaning door buttons, grab handles, tables and all touch points, as well as equipment such as phones, chip and pin machines, self-service ticket machines and point of sale systems.Shops on board Voyager services, which travel between London and destinations such as Blackpool, Shrewsbury, Birmingham, Edinburgh and North Wales, will be closed and no food and drink will be available.The shops on Pendolino services will still be open, but re-usable coffee cups will not be accepted. Avanti said a new timetable was being brought in from Monday, in line with updated travel advice from the government that will see train services increase to about 70% of the normal timetable.During the coronavirus pandemic only half of normal rail services have been running.Chiltern Railways also revealed a new timetable, which comes into force on 18 May, and has advised its passengers to book tickets in advance where possible and to wear masks.

Coronavirus: Loneliness and lockdown exploited in romance scams,"Organised criminals will be exploiting loneliness during lockdown to take money from romance scam victims, a charity has said.Victim Support said people's increased confidence in using the internet to meet and talk leaves them vulnerable.Research in one region shows romance scam victims are groomed, then tricked out of an average of £47,000.One has spoken of how her ""heart ruled my head"" when sending money to the man she thought she loved.Mary, not her real name, was already in the fraudsters' grip before the coronavirus outbreak.But, as the virus started to spread, she believed he was in a country heavily affected, giving him the opportunity to trick more money out of her.She was also feeling the kind of loneliness common among many vulnerable people during the current crisis.  The 62-year-old, who is a widow, met ""Arnold"" after using a dating site for the very first time.She said they spoke morning, noon and night for five months about a shared love of music and family.But the man she thought was an American living overseas was, in fact, a organised criminal gang working shifts to private message or speak to her over a crackly line.""There were red flags, but I kept denying them,"" she said. ""You think you have found the love of your life, and invest yourself 100% into the relationship.""After about a month, Arnold told her stories such as suffering from an accident, his need for a working laptop, and business problems. He told her how worried he was by the coronavirus outbreak, an event that gave him another chance to ask for money.She sent him funds via money transfer, and followed his request not to tell anyone because ""he would be embarrassed when he eventually met members of the family"".She ended up sending thousands of pounds. The money is now lost. It came from savings for a car or a holiday, and included some money that belonged to her daughter, who she first lied to rather than come clean about the loss.""Eventually I knew I could not lie to my daughter anymore,"" she said. ""It is the emotions that you are left to deal with which is the hard part. I cannot trust anyone, and there is a lot of grief.""In a fantasy world, I let myself think he is going to turn up and be real. You can be too emotionally involved in it.""This ""addiction"" to hear someone saying nice things to you, and which blinds you to the reality, is common among victims, according to Lisa Mills, senior fraud manager at Victim Support in Sussex.During the current lockdown, when ""the feelings of loneliness can be overwhelming"", the risks were all the greater, she said.Sussex police run Operation Signature, a campaign to identify and support vulnerable victims of fraud.Romance scam cases were increasing, Mrs Mills said, even before lockdown - a picture reflected nationwide. Criminal gangs ""meet"" people on dating sites, then take the conversation onto private messaging, build up a picture of their victim, then take any opportunity to steal money from them.Source: Action FraudMrs Mills said that, in her experience, victims were split fairly evenly between men and women, with some losing so much money they were forced to remortgage their home.Most struggled to accept they had been scammed, even after the language used in messages was analysed to show they must have been written by different people in a gang, not just one individual.There is thought to be huge under-reporting of these scams, for the same reason.""It has never been more important to reach out and know how to protect people,"" Mrs Mills said, urging anyone who may be concerned not to feel embarrassed but to seek help.",15 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Lloyd's of London says claims to be biggest since 9/11,"Insurance market Lloyd's of London has said it expects coronavirus-related claims to cost it $3bn to $4.3bn (£2.5bn to £3.5bn).That means its biggest payout since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US.The losses could rise further if the current lockdown continues into another quarter, Lloyd's said.Insurers around the world have been hit by the cost of the pandemic, although many would-be claimants have found the virus is not covered by their policies.Lloyd's said its payout on coronavirus claims would also equal the combined impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017.Those three hurricanes brought devastation to the Caribbean and parts of the US, in what is reckoned to be the costliest year for storms on record.Lloyd's chief executive John Neal told the BBC ""it could be two years before everyone really gets their arms around the true cost of this pandemic"". ""We estimate that government borrowing could be as much as $10trn globally to protect the economy for the losses that we've seen,"" he added. He also implied that between $1bn-$1.4bn has been paid by Lloyds members for business interruption claims because of coronavirus, despite the fact that the vast majority of businesses ""don't have the right cover and the right protection in force for this type of event"". Mr Neal said that there were ""some pretty harsh lessons"" to take away from the pandemic, and that the insurance market would need to structure policies and covers differently in future so that businesses are ""protected more completely"".""Importantly, these natural catastrophes were geographically contained events, occurring over the course of hours and days - vastly different in nature to the global, systemic and longer-term impact of Covid-19,"" Lloyd's said.Mr Neal said the global insurance industry was paying out on ""a very wide range of policies"" to support business and people affected by the pandemic.He added: ""What makes Covid-19 unique is not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock. ""Taking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before, but we will keep focused on supporting our customers and continuing to pay claims over the weeks and months ahead.""Nearly a third of the insurance losses are expected to come from the cancellation or postponement of major events around the world, including the Tokyo Olympics, which are now due to take place in 2021.Other major categories include business interruption claims on property insurance.Many small businesses in the UK are at loggerheads with insurers who they say have denied them payments for disruption. The insurers say most small business policies do not cover the pandemic.One Lloyd's of London insurer, Hiscox, has said it will not pay out on business interruption claims resulting from the virus outbreak.Lloyd's said its total payouts arising from the 9/11 attacks were $4.7bn, while the 2017 hurricanes led to combined payouts of $4.8bn.Lloyd's said that once all factors were taken into account, the total impact of coronavirus on the insurance industry as a whole was likely to be far bigger.""The estimated 2020 underwriting losses covered by the industry as a result of Covid-19 are approximately $107bn,"" it said.""In addition, unlike other events, the industry will also experience falls in investment portfolios of an estimated $96bn, bringing the total projected loss to the insurance industry to $203bn.""",14 May 2020,business

The holiday was cancelled.However, the couple managed in March to complete their planned move from London back to the north of England where they had both grown up. They had planned to stay with their parents in Saltaire, near Bradford, while they looked for a new home. But since both sets of parents are vulnerable, the couple had to move in with friends instead.James, a product consultant for a technology firm, decided to improvise his proposal plans in these far from ideal circumstances.“I set up a treasure hunt in the village where she grew up with riddles and poems in meaningful places,” he explains. Since he did it on her 30th birthday, she didn’t necessarily suspect what was to come. The final clue led to a spot on the moors, where he asked the big question. She said yes.The tricky thing from a practical point of view was the ring, explains James. He wasn’t sure he wanted to buy an expensive diamond one online and have it arrive by post, but of course he couldn’t go to a shop because of lockdown.In the end, he decided to buy a ring online that he would use just for the proposal. He knew it still had to look good, and similar to the real one he would eventually get so that they could show if off in engagement photos, he says. The couple plan to wait until 2022 to get married, because they know there will be huge pressure to hold postponed weddings next year.This is something we can celebrate now, and cherish, despite coronavirus, says James.In Northamptonshire, Marilyn Coles, 24, and Roland Walet, 26, were also in lockdown.They met on Tinder last year and have been living together for just over six months.They hadn’t been thinking about marriage before, but coronavirus focused their minds.“Lockdown is a stressful situation and it’s brought us closer together,” says Roland. “Spending more time together has bonded us, we can see every side of each other.”It allowed Roland to get to know Marilyn’s son from a previous relationship properly, he adds.“Suddenly I could see myself spending the rest of my life with Marilyn.”Marilyn remembers the day of the proposal well.“The doorbell rings and he went a bit giddy as he went down the stairs, bless him.”“I suspected it was the ring at last,” explains Roland. He had got one customised online.After a quick inspection to make sure it was what he expected inside the envelope, he braced himself and returned upstairs to propose in the bedroom.The prospect of big ceremonies and occasions, says Marilyn, makes her feel anxious, so this was just the kind of proposal she wanted.Roland is a Dutch national and the couple plan to marry next year in Amsterdam in an informal ceremony with friends.“Love doesn’t wait,” says Tobias Kormind, head of jewellers 77 Diamonds, with a wry smile. It specialises in selling diamond rings online and ships more than 10,000 each year.He anticipated “a massive drop in demand” as a result of coronavirus, up to 80% of sales perhaps, he says.In fact, so far his company has seen a sales drop of only around a quarter.Normally he sells 60% of rings online and the rest in physical stores, but online sales have risen since lockdown, helping to stabilise the business.“Many customers have told us that even though they can no longer travel to a special proposal location, they don’t want to wait and are proposing at home instead in very thoughtful and imaginative ways,” says Kormind.“If someone feels the time is right to propose, then it’s right. The setting is only really window dressing. In times of crisis you get to know people a lot better, a lot quicker.“With lockdown, it’s like you actually have the government pushing love,” he jokes.Hamish Shephard, founder of wedding planning platform Bridebook, has spotted a similar trend.“We thought our business would grind to a halt when coronavirus struck,” he says.Bridebook has handled more than 170,000 weddings since starting in 2015.In fact new sign-ups to his service this April only dropped slightly compared with the previous year, by around 5%.The feedback from customers is that despite unprecedented financial pressures, and the inability to hold wedding ceremonies, couples still want to get engaged, says Shephard.He too puts it down to couples spending more time together.Ones who are furloughed are getting the chance to share hobbies and learn about each other’s interests, outside of the usual grind of work, he says.He predicts that 2021 and 2022 will be bumper years for the wedding business. One of 77 Diamond’s recent customers is police officer Daniel Hughes-McConnell, 30. He originally had grand plans for a proposal in New York.He was well aware that his long-term girlfriend, nurse Emily Hands, also 30, had dreamed of it happening next to the Rockefeller Plaza Christmas tree. She’d had the idea since watching the film Home Alone as a little girl.He made the necessary arrangements, but the dream was quashed when travel firm Thomas Cook collapsed.Daniel then planned to propose on a trip to Italy. When coronavirus forced him to cancel their travel plans again, he thought he was cursed.Like James, he decided to adapt his plans to the new reality of lockdown, rather than delay.He admits to being a little apprehensive about getting the ring in the post. It was sent first class and recorded delivery. But he ended up getting in a panic because he forgot there was a bank holiday coming, which delayed its arrival by a day (Emily’s face winces in disbelief during our video call as he apparently shares this detail for the first time).Daniel proposed on a beach near where the couple live in Prestatyn in North Wales, a place they used to take romantic walks together when they first starting going out.He chose a spot to go down on one knee with extra significance for Emily - a bench commemorating her best friend from school, who died a few years ago.Emily was touched by the gesture and is glad the couple didn’t postpone the engagement, waiting for a grander and more expensive proposal abroad.“In fact, the cheaper proposal has been a blessing in disguise,” says Daniel.“The money we saved by not going to New York or Rome, will be spent on our first baby, who we are expecting in November.” If you have an inspiring personal story about being in lockdown, contact reporter Dougal Shaw",17 May 2020,business
My Money: 'No expenditure at all today!',"My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here Bex Young takes us through a week in her life in lockdown.Bex, 32, works for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), at the Jobcentre in Dundee. The centre is closed to the public but she is still going into work in the office, which has introduced social distancing measures.She loves running and has done several 10ks and half marathons. Her next challenge is the full marathon - she isn't sure she has the patience for it but is definitely going to try.She usually spends a lot of time with friends - going for cocktails at weekends, pub crawls and trips to different cities. She also loves fashion and is known for her bright and sparkly outfits and shoes. She is gutted there's no reason to get properly dressed up just now, with pubs and bars closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Over to Bex....06:15 - Wake up feeling fed up, another week of lockdown. At least the sun is shining and it's a bank holiday on Friday so feel a lot better once I'm up and about.13:20 - Doing different food shops as and when I need to. Head to Lidl on my lunch break and get a pack of Cup a Soups, hash browns, red peppers, onion dip and Mexican rice all for only £3.90.Total spend: £3.9013:30 - Go to Tesco on my lunch break today and buy Quorn cocktail sausages and mini cucumbers to snack on. Another nice day so I walk near the City Quay for 20 minutes and enjoy the view.16.30 - Waiting to move into my new house on 19 June and I'm so glad B&Q has reopened. I go in for paint and, after deciding I need more time, I come out with just three colour charts to study.Total spend: £2.8012:30 - M&S here is usually fairly quiet with no queue to get in but there is today. Can't be bothered but persevere as I want their giant stuffed tortellini and espresso martini bottled cocktail mix, which I find reduced to £5.50, yay! Also buy a box of cherry tomatoes and avocados for a sunny day salad. Grand total £9.50.15:00 - Arrive home to find my retro games console has arrived from Amazon. It was an impulse buy the other day as it had good reviews and 400 games. After an hour on Tetris and Aladdin I finally switch it off. Pretty good but a bit gutted no Sonic or Super Mario included, though for the price really can't complain - £15.99.Total spend: £25.49Last day of work this week as bank holiday tomorrow and feeling happy after 10k run as it's super sunny.Don't really need any supplies but use my lunchtime exercise to buy some cocktail ingredients as due to the abroad-style sun, decide I am making some at home this weekend - crème de menthe, vanilla ice cream, gin and soya milk from Lidl and Tesco, comes to £27.59.Total spend: £27.59Due to my daily food shops on work breaks, I am well stocked with food so don't need anything today. Go for a run in the local park then start on packing for my house move, starting with shoes and winter jumpers.As I can't go for my usual pub time this Friday, I stay in with some gin and my iPad and make my Grasshopper cocktails which taste amazing. After a few drinks I end up online shopping and order a few bodysuits, sandals and a playsuit. 25% off everything so the total is only £60.20.Total spend: £60.20More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series:Wake up early and go for a run, then feeling a bit bored, sit around watching documentaries and have a few vodkas before falling asleep really early. No expenditure at all today!Total spend: £0Another sunny day, decide to be productive so start with more packing - DVDs and all my jewellery and beauty sets this time. Drive to Morrisons and Lidl for a few things, feel like a cooked breakfast (veggie style) as girl at work has been selling duck eggs and I have a few left. Get beans, veggie sausages and potato scones and pleased with the result, so good. Total spend: £3.00Not too bad, probably more than I've spent most weeks in lockdown so far as I bought the online clothes shop which makes up almost half the expenditure. I would usually spend about £150-£200 a week so still a decent saving. I think I'm spending more on food as there is nowhere else to go shop-wise.

Coronavirus: Should furloughed workers offer their skills for free?,"Many furloughed workers, with time on their hands, are offering up their skills for free, but some freelancers are taking issue with the trend.“I was sick of making banana bread!” jokes Stella Norris. The 31-year-old normally works as a digital marketing manager for a London arts agency. She’s been furloughed and wants desperately to return to her old job – but in the meantime, she’s working from home, volunteering for a charity called Children of Rwanda.Furloughed workers are those who are being asked to stay at home by employers during the coronavirus lockdown on 80% salary. This is funded by the government’s Job Retention Scheme, which opened on 20 April.Stella was matched up by Furlonteer.com, one of a growing number of platforms connecting furloughed workers to organisations that need help.“It was surprisingly easy to sort,” says Stella.The charity made sure her background was right for the role and she had a video call with the chief executive. He wanted five hours per week from her – in practice she’s happy to offer more, helping them reach people online.“I treat it like my normal work, giving them a weekly round-up of what I’ve been up to,” she says.Many charities now need help with online skills to reach potential donors because they can't do traditional fundraising.As well as keeping her occupied, the work has brought other benefits. Learning about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on people far less fortunate than herself has given her welcome perspective on her own position, she says.Furlonteer.com is a non-profit organisation that connects people only to charities. But there are other schemes doing the same for commercial enterprises. For example, Furloughed Life, set up by Techcelerate Ventures, introduces furloughed workers to struggling technology start-ups. They work for free, but the start-ups pay a subscription fee to Techcelerate, half of which is donated to the NHS. The recruitment site Work in Start-Ups has also created a new section on its website to provide a similar service. Another platform called Look After connects communications professionals ""who would rather put [their] skills to use than sit idle"" with both charities and businesses.Furloughed workers are also volunteering their skills informally on social media.This may seem well-intentioned, but some are crying foul.Freelancers and the self-employed don’t have access to the furlough scheme and have been left short of work and income. They only gained access to the Self Employed Income Support Scheme on 13 May, and some complain they are not eligible due to its terms.Helen Parton, a freelance journalist who works in design publishing, feels volunteering platforms are unjust, taking potential work away from people like her.“I think those that are furloughed should concentrate on learning Italian or baking banana bread rather than trying to upset what is quite a fragile ecosystem of freelance work,” she says. “Even volunteering for charities opens up a wide spectrum of work and size of organisation. There's a big difference between digital copywriting for a large charity for free, which could be taking work a freelancer might do on a paid basis, to literally delivering meals to vulnerable people.“There's this big emphasis on social media on furloughing being a time to 'develop your side hustle’, but if you're offering those skills for free - writing, photographing, social media, yoga - there are people out there that do that for their main business.”Matt Dowling of Freelancer Club, which represents 40,000 freelancers, shares this view.""No-one should be using this crisis as an excuse to pick up some free labour,” he says. ""Tech companies encouraging 'volunteering' work sets a deeply disturbing precedent and opens the door for mass exploitation at a time when freelancers are hugely vulnerable. ""When it comes to charities, it is a little bit trickier,” he says, “as it's often a personal choice by the individual and involves supporting a cause they care about, so I'd never say it shouldn't be pursued.”Stella says she is used to working alongside freelancers and is sympathetic to their plight. It’s an issue she discussed with Furlonteer.com before signing up with them – and she was reassured by their arguments.“It’s why we stuck to charities with our services,” says Furlonteer co-founder Sam Tasker-Grindley. “They don’t have bottomless pockets, they certainly don’t have the cash now, so there is a definite need.”These charities wouldn’t otherwise be hiring freelancers, says fellow co-founder Hamish Shephard, a serial entrepreneur who has founded internet businesses HelloFresh and Bridebook. Read more on furlough rulesIn fact Shephard believes there is a moral case for setting furloughed people to work.“I’m not sure if I should say this,” he says, “but our platform sort of comes from a sense of anger. I felt it was unfair that you’d have furloughed workers sitting at home doing nothing, yet being paid more money than people like nurses, who are putting their lives on the line – both being funded by the taxpayer.”For that reason he thinks furloughed people have a duty to do more to help right now.And many have heeded the call. Furlonteer.com signed up 2,500 people within two weeks of launching in late April. Of these just over 500 have been matched with the more than 50 charities involved, including UN Women, Meals for the NHS, The Big Give and UK Community Network.Many of the big charities like Oxfam and Save the Children have furloughed employees and need help, says Shephard. “We’ve probably never seen so much community spirit as now, like the clap for the NHS, so why not harness it? I feel this is like a civic duty.”Shephard also thinks people should consider signing up to volunteer out of self-interest too.“Think about job interviews in the future, especially when we are looking at a competitive market in a possible recession,” he says. “People are bound to ask you, ‘What did you do during lockdown?' Do you really want to say, ‘I watched everything on Netflix?'”If you have a story about being furloughed you want to share, contact reporter Dougal Shaw",15 May 2020,business
How coronavirus is changing NHS technology,"""Many people within the NHS are talking about two years of transformation done in two weeks,"" says Adrian Byrne, chief information officer at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHSFT).His hospital has been among the many seeing innovations, including the use of a chatbot to provide automatic alerts for Covid-19 test results. ""Doctors don't look on the system every five minutes to see whether test results are back and this can waste time in being able to discharge or provide patients with care,"" says Mr Byrne.The coronavirus outbreak has spurred hospitals to deal with all sorts of technology issues, not least staff having to use devices while dressed in full personal protective equipment (PPE).At the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, Dr Peter Young, an anaesthetist and intensive care specialist, had to ask for an app to be built to help non-specialist staff in critical care units to communicate more effectively. ""They continuously have many questions and while in full PPE they have to rely on a number of ad hoc WhatsApp lists to try and track down the right person who can help them or else they physically have to leave the unit to sort out their problem, wasting valuable PPE,"" he says.Through the Call 4 Help app, staff can request help from everyone in the ICU through a real-time message board. Senior doctors and nurses can monitor and assign tasks through the app, which has been built with PPE in mind.""We've made sure it is easy to read through visors, and the onscreen buttons are sensitive enough to work easily through double gloved fingers,"" says Dr Young. The iPhone X was chosen for the ICU as it is waterproof for cleaning, has a loud speaker and sensitive microphone. Once the requestor connects with the responder, the app provides a link to switch from the message board to FaceTime or a phone call if required. The app could be rolled out to all NHS hospitals nationwide.   Sarah Wilkinson, NHS Digital's CEO, says that the organisation has had to scale up its NHS 111 service, as it was receiving almost 100 time as much use as before the pandemic. In addition, NHS Digital has worked with a team at Cambridge University that has built machine learning models to predict the upcoming demand for ICU beds and for ventilators.This is being extended to estimate how long patients will stay in hospital and eventually, Ms Wilkinson hopes, it could help to simulate the best environments and treatment decisions for patients. These models have been deployed across many NHS trusts already. The pandemic has also accelerated a number of projects which had been on many NHS trusts' agendas for a very long time.""The clamour for virtual smart cards instead of physical cards increased as we moved into PPE environments, where putting in the physical card was very difficult,"" Ms Wilkinson said, explaining that the NHS has rolled out virtual cards as a result. Video conferencing tools had been put on the backburner too, but are now enabling GPs to communicate with patients, doctors to oversee wards and patients to speak to their families and friends.Mike Ogonovsky, assistant director of informatics at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board says the NHS Wales video consulting service reached 88% of GP practices within a month across Wales, and it has been extended to include hospitals, mental health services and care homes.""It was an R&D evaluation programme which turned into an aggressive national rollout plan in Wales when the pandemic hit - it became a very black and white issue,"" he says.  Similar tools are being used across Scotland and England, while Microsoft Teams has been deployed to 1.2 million users with NHS mail. Another programme of work has been to reduce the amount of paper created in wards. ""If we're creating paper notes in a Covid-19 positive environment then those notes are a risk for 72 hours, so we're placing them somewhere else before scanning them. This is a hassle as the notes are not available immediately and there is a risk to any of the administrative teams who want to go through them,"" Mr Byrne explains. One of the biggest frustrations within the NHS is the inability for every organisation to have access to patient details when they're required. Ms Wilkinson says that many of the patient-sharing initiatives that had been built prior to the pandemic, such as GP Connect, have now been commissioned to be made more accessible for Covid-19. More Technology of BusinessThe lingering question then, is why weren't many of these technologies being used prior to the pandemic?""ICT budgets compete against the budgets of fixing a leaky roof or hiring another clinician, meaning there are immensely difficult judgements to make, particularly as some other costs pay off immediately and IT may be slower to pay off,"" says Ms Wilkinson. For instance, some trusts had bought desktop computers instead of laptops because they were cheaper. Even though laptops allow staff to move around more freely and work from home, many trusts may not have believed that this would save money -  and all technology projects have to prove that they can save the NHS money to get the green light. Dr Young says the Care 4 Help app would not have been possible in normal circumstances because of the funds and time required for development. Twenty engineers from Kulestar, 4 Roads, CK Alpha and Concept Software have voluntarily worked full-time on the app. But during this crisis, those in the NHS making the financial decisions have been far more receptive to those on the technology side. ""I think anyone in IT in the NHS would tell you it's been a lot easier to do things in the last few weeks than it would have been prior to the crisis. We're now seeing freeing up of money for digital because it has had to happen,"" says Mr Byrne. But the NHS may have been in a better place to manage the crisis if certain projects had been given the go-ahead far earlier, says Cindy Fedell, the chief digital and information officer at Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.""Video conferencing is something we could have done one or two years ago, but it was slow to get off the ground, not because of technical issues, but because of people.""Funding is just one part of the problem; there are also strategic and cultural barriers that those in IT in the NHS have to contend with, but Ms Wilkinson believes this will improve as a result of what is now being achieved.""The art of the possible is so much better understood now, I think we will have a much better understanding [of]... the enormous potential for digitalisation. There will be a broader appetite to invest,"" she says. ",15 May 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Coronavirus: Should furloughed workers offer their skills for free?,"Many furloughed workers, with time on their hands, are offering up their skills for free, but some freelancers are taking issue with the trend.“I was sick of making banana bread!” jokes Stella Norris. The 31-year-old normally works as a digital marketing manager for a London arts agency. She’s been furloughed and wants desperately to return to her old job – but in the meantime, she’s working from home, volunteering for a charity called Children of Rwanda.Furloughed workers are those who are being asked to stay at home by employers during the coronavirus lockdown on 80% salary. This is funded by the government’s Job Retention Scheme, which opened on 20 April.Stella was matched up by Furlonteer.com, one of a growing number of platforms connecting furloughed workers to organisations that need help.“It was surprisingly easy to sort,” says Stella.The charity made sure her background was right for the role and she had a video call with the chief executive. He wanted five hours per week from her – in practice she’s happy to offer more, helping them reach people online.“I treat it like my normal work, giving them a weekly round-up of what I’ve been up to,” she says.Many charities now need help with online skills to reach potential donors because they can't do traditional fundraising.As well as keeping her occupied, the work has brought other benefits. Learning about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on people far less fortunate than herself has given her welcome perspective on her own position, she says.Furlonteer.com is a non-profit organisation that connects people only to charities. But there are other schemes doing the same for commercial enterprises. For example, Furloughed Life, set up by Techcelerate Ventures, introduces furloughed workers to struggling technology start-ups. They work for free, but the start-ups pay a subscription fee to Techcelerate, half of which is donated to the NHS. The recruitment site Work in Start-Ups has also created a new section on its website to provide a similar service. Another platform called Look After connects communications professionals ""who would rather put [their] skills to use than sit idle"" with both charities and businesses.Furloughed workers are also volunteering their skills informally on social media.This may seem well-intentioned, but some are crying foul.Freelancers and the self-employed don’t have access to the furlough scheme and have been left short of work and income. They only gained access to the Self Employed Income Support Scheme on 13 May, and some complain they are not eligible due to its terms.Helen Parton, a freelance journalist who works in design publishing, feels volunteering platforms are unjust, taking potential work away from people like her.“I think those that are furloughed should concentrate on learning Italian or baking banana bread rather than trying to upset what is quite a fragile ecosystem of freelance work,” she says. “Even volunteering for charities opens up a wide spectrum of work and size of organisation. There's a big difference between digital copywriting for a large charity for free, which could be taking work a freelancer might do on a paid basis, to literally delivering meals to vulnerable people.“There's this big emphasis on social media on furloughing being a time to 'develop your side hustle’, but if you're offering those skills for free - writing, photographing, social media, yoga - there are people out there that do that for their main business.”Matt Dowling of Freelancer Club, which represents 40,000 freelancers, shares this view.""No-one should be using this crisis as an excuse to pick up some free labour,” he says. ""Tech companies encouraging 'volunteering' work sets a deeply disturbing precedent and opens the door for mass exploitation at a time when freelancers are hugely vulnerable. ""When it comes to charities, it is a little bit trickier,” he says, “as it's often a personal choice by the individual and involves supporting a cause they care about, so I'd never say it shouldn't be pursued.”Stella says she is used to working alongside freelancers and is sympathetic to their plight. It’s an issue she discussed with Furlonteer.com before signing up with them – and she was reassured by their arguments.“It’s why we stuck to charities with our services,” says Furlonteer co-founder Sam Tasker-Grindley. “They don’t have bottomless pockets, they certainly don’t have the cash now, so there is a definite need.”These charities wouldn’t otherwise be hiring freelancers, says fellow co-founder Hamish Shephard, a serial entrepreneur who has founded internet businesses HelloFresh and Bridebook. Read more on furlough rulesIn fact Shephard believes there is a moral case for setting furloughed people to work.“I’m not sure if I should say this,” he says, “but our platform sort of comes from a sense of anger. I felt it was unfair that you’d have furloughed workers sitting at home doing nothing, yet being paid more money than people like nurses, who are putting their lives on the line – both being funded by the taxpayer.”For that reason he thinks furloughed people have a duty to do more to help right now.And many have heeded the call. Furlonteer.com signed up 2,500 people within two weeks of launching in late April. Of these just over 500 have been matched with the more than 50 charities involved, including UN Women, Meals for the NHS, The Big Give and UK Community Network.Many of the big charities like Oxfam and Save the Children have furloughed employees and need help, says Shephard. “We’ve probably never seen so much community spirit as now, like the clap for the NHS, so why not harness it? I feel this is like a civic duty.”Shephard also thinks people should consider signing up to volunteer out of self-interest too.“Think about job interviews in the future, especially when we are looking at a competitive market in a possible recession,” he says. “People are bound to ask you, ‘What did you do during lockdown?' Do you really want to say, ‘I watched everything on Netflix?'”If you have a story about being furloughed you want to share, contact reporter Dougal Shaw",15 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Self-employed grant claims top one million,"More than one million self-employed people whose businesses are affected by coronavirus have applied for government grants.The value of the claims made so far is more than £3bn, said tax officials.The Self Employed Income Support Scheme is designed to support people in a similar way to the scheme for furloughed employees. The grants are calculated as 80% of average monthly profit over a period of up to three years.The scheme is the biggest direct financial support package for freelancers and the self-employed since lockdown started.The process is being run by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), which has been operating and overseeing loan schemes and the government's furlough payments.The scheme was unveiled in March after the government faced criticism for failing to provide support for self-employed and freelance workers in its earlier package of economic measures.However, those who started in business from early April last year will miss out, as will those who pay themselves just with dividends from a limited company.The government has not said whether the initiative will be extended into the autumn in line with the furlough scheme, which protects 80% of employees' wages up to £2,500 a month.On Tuesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that scheme was being extended until the end of October.

Coronavirus: Royal Mail boss Rico Back in surprise exit,"The boss of Royal Mail is leaving after less than two years in the role amid reports he has been running the business from his home in Switzerland.Rico Back will step down as chief executive with immediate effect and Keith Williams, the former boss of BA, will take over as executive chairman.Mr Back has reportedly been at his Lake Zurich house since just after lockdown.The Royal Mail said he was ""following government advice to work from home unless you cannot"". Royal Mail has seen a sharp fall in letter volumes since the coronavirus lockdown was introduced in the UK on 23 March.The company said that while there had been a ""substantial switch from letters to parcels in the UK"", revenues during April fell £22m compared to the same month last year.It has also faced criticism from its own staff, who said last month that there was a shortage of gloves, masks and hand sanitiser to protect them from contracting coronavirus.Royal Mail said it had invested in safety equipment and said the costs of running its UK postal service had risen by £40m ""driven by overtime and agency resource costs due to high levels of absence, the introduction of social distancing measures and PPE"".Mr Back has been put on gardening leave until 15 August, during which he will receive his pay and benefits. He will then receive nine monthly payments totalling £480,000.Royal Mail also said it would provide up to £50,000 towards his legal fees and a maximum £25,000 towards outplacement support.Mr Back's compensation has been at the centre of controversy in the past after he received a £5.8m payment in July 2017 when his contract as boss of Royal Mail's European parcels business was renegotiated.It prompted a letter from Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee, to Royal Mail demanding an explanation.Mr Back, who has worked at Royal Mail for two decades, said: ""It has been a privilege to lead a company that is so much a part of UK life at this crucial time in its history."" Royal Mail also announced that its executive directors will not receive bonuses for the 2019-20 financial year and said £25m has been set aside for ""cash awards for frontline staff, in recognition of their role during COVID-19"".Just prior to lockdown, postal workers had voted to go on strike in a row over pay and working conditions but delayed the action because of the pandemic.Commenting on Mr Back's departure, the Communication Workers' Union said: ""The change of chief executive by Royal Mail Group must now bring about a total change in strategy and direction. ""Postal workers have been outstanding during this pandemic and are ready to embrace innovation, new products and building on their role in every community in the UK.""Royal Mail has been attempting to refocus the business as parcel volumes grow, fuelled by online shopping, and the number of letters being sent falls.In its most recent trading update, Royal Mail said UK parcel volumes rose 31% in April while addressed letters dropped by 33%.Royal Mail said that Mr Williams said will lead discussions ""about an accelerated pace of change across the business"".It also said that the chairman will remain in the executive role until a permanent chief executive of Royal Mail is appointed.Royal Mail's share price rose 7.5% to 174.57p each.",15 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: LNER introduces mandatory ticket reservations,"East Coast train operator LNER is to introduce mandatory seat reservations on all train services from Monday. The measure, to help social distancing on trains, will mean passengers with flexible tickets will have to pick a service to travel on, in advance.The company operates services between London and Leeds, and Edinburgh, York, Newcastle and London, Separately, Avanti West Coast is urging customers to reserve tickets, but has not made it compulsory.However, it says passengers may not be allowed to get on a train if they do not have a reservation.Avanti, which runs services linking London, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham, is also encouraging people to wear face coverings when they travel.Chiltern Railways is also advising its passengers to book tickets in advance where possible and to wear masks. LNER confirmed its shift to mandatory reservations in a tweet. This contained ""tips"" for passengers, travelling on its trains, including:The company concluded by asking: ""Can you travel another way? Help us keep the trains clear for those who really need them.""To support social distancing, our services will be reservation only from Monday.
