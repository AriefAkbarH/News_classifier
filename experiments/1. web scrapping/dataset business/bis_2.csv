Coronavirus: WTO head steps down a year early as downturn looms,"The head of the World Trade Organization has said he will step down a year earlier than planned, at a crucial moment for the global economy.Roberto Azevedo's surprise departure comes as the WTO faces the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and criticism from US President Donald Trump.Global trade has slumped and the world is braced for the worst downturn since the Great Depression.Meanwhile, Mr Trump has accused the body of treating America unfairly.Mr Azevedo said his early departure as the WTO's director-general was a ""personal decision"" that was in the best interests of the organisation.""The WTO may not be perfect, but it is indispensable all the same. It is what keeps us from a world where the law of the jungle prevails, at least as far as trade is concerned.""The Trump administration has repeatedly accused the global trade watchdog of having strayed from its purpose to liberalise and protect markets, and that conditions around China's entry into the organisation in 2001 have led to millions of American job losses.Asked about Mr Azevedo's exit, Mr Trump, who had previously said the US would leave the organisation if it didn't change, said he was ""OK with it"".""We've been treated very badly... They treat China as a developing nation. Therefore China gets a lot of the benefits that the US doesn't get,"" he added.Mr Azevedo's departure comes at an especially difficult time for the WTO, with global trade expected to slump to historic lows as measures to slow the spread of Covid-19 shut down economic activity around the world.At the same time the Geneva-based body last year saw one of its main functions, arbitrating trade disputes, hobbled by the US.Washington's dispute with the WTO has seen it block the appointment of judges to the organisation's top court, called the Appellate Body, since December 2019.

Coronavirus 'could cost global economy $8.8tn' says ADB,"The coronavirus pandemic could cost the global economy between $5.8tn and $8.8tn (£4.7tn-£7.1tn), according to Asian Development Bank (ADB).That's more than double last month's prediction and equates to 6.4%-9.7% of the world's economic output.It comes as measures to slow the spread of Covid-19 continue to paralyse economic activity around the world.Globally authorities have taken aggressive action to cushion their economies from the outbreak's impact.""This new analysis presents a broad picture of the very significant potential economic impact of Covid-19,"" the ADB's chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada said.""It also highlights the important role policy interventions can play to help mitigate damage to economies,"" he added.The ADB said the top end of the range was based on the assumption that curbs to movement and businesses operating would last six months, while the bottom end assumed the restrictions would remain in place for three months.Central banks around the world have moved aggressively to cut interest rates and roll out massive stimulus measures to help combat the impact of the outbreak that has rocked financial markets and raised fears of a deep global recession.Yesterday new figures showed the huge impact of Covid-19 on the world's biggest economy as the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits jumped by almost 3 million last week. Nearly a quarter of the US workforce is now claiming some form of benefits. Earlier this week the chairman of the US Federal Reserve warned that America's economic recovery is likely to be slower than initially hoped.Jerome Powell cautioned that the US faces a slow and painful economic recovery without more government relief.At the same time it was estimated that the UK government's efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic has risen to £123.2bn.The Office for Budget Responsibility said it now expects annual borrowing to equal 15.2% of the UK economy, with increased cost of the government's furlough scheme being the main cause for the increase.",15 May 2020,business
One in four US workers claiming jobless benefits,"The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits jumped by almost 3 million last week as virus shutdowns continue to weigh on the US economy.The filings brought the total number of new jobless claims since the middle of March to more than 36 million.That amounts to nearly a quarter of the American workforce.The weekly figures have been falling since the end of March but remain massive by historic standards, eclipsing the prior record of 700,000.""Today's unemployment claims continue their epic ascent on a cumulative weekly basis; not since the Great Depression has the US job market been in such a sorry state,"" said Richard Flynn, UK managing director at Charles Schwab.The head of America's central bank warned this week that the economic recovery is likely to be slower than initially hoped.In April, employers cut more than 20 million jobs, sending the unemployment rate to 14.7% and erasing nearly a decade of job gains. While the losses have fallen hardest on minority and low-income households, they have touched every part of the economy.However, economists said they believe hiring will start to pick up as more states ease restrictions on activity. The increase in the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended 9 May was ""relatively modest"", noted Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.""With most states only beginning to ease their lockdowns over the last 10 days, we expect a much bigger swing in hiring versus firing over the next couple of weeks, which suggests the unemployment rate will begin to drop back,"" he said.This is the first time I've been unemployed since I was 14. Being laid off kind of hit me out of the blue - in my company we thought we were all safe.Applying for unemployment has been frustrating. You have to fax your notice in to the Department of Labour - but I don't have a fax machine. And then the receiving fax machine also needs to have paper - with government offices mostly closed, it took me five times to send something through.I'm very lucky - I've always saved money, since I started working as a babysitter as a teenager, so I've socked away enough money to be OK for now. But if I catch Covid-19 and go to hospital, that whole plan would be disrupted. My biggest concern is how things are going to work if I have no health insurance anymore. I'm job hunting right now - everyone's very excited to talk, but unfortunately no one knows what's going to happen so there aren't any firm job openings.Stories of fear, unemployment and hopeReporting by Helier Cheung ",14 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Avanti introduces social distancing measures on its trains,"Rail passengers have been urged not to turn up at stations without an advance ticket and to wear face coverings when they travel on the West Coast Mainline.Avanti West Coast made the announcement as part of new social distancing on its services between Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds.  Passengers might be refused travel if the guidelines are not followed.The measures take effect on Monday and Avanti says it may not allow carriages to be more than a quarter full.""We're appealing to our valued customers to help us and other passengers by only travelling with a reservation,""  said Avanti West Coast's managing director Phil Whittingham.""If everyone does this, we'll be able to keep social distancing in place on board, both for our customers and our people.""If customers do turn up without a reservation, we'll do our best to help but we can't guarantee they'll be able to take the train they want.""Because of this, the train operator is asking passengers to book in advance on the Avanti mobile app where possible, to avoid using facilities at the station or handling cash.People should also check before they travel, in case the time of their train has changed.Other measures being introduced by Avanti include face masks for staff and waiting rooms and lounges will be shut. There will also be enhanced cleaning procedures onboard trains and at stations, especially focused on cleaning door buttons, grab handles, tables and all touch points, as well as equipment like phones, chip and pin machines, self-service ticket machines and point of sale systems.Shops onboard Voyager services, which travel between London and destinations like Blackpool, Shrewsbury, Birmingham, Edinburgh and North Wales, will be closed and no food and drink will be available.The shops on Pendolino services will still be open, but re-usable coffee cups will not be accepted. A new timetable is being brought in from Monday, in line with updated travel advice from the government that will see train services increase to about 70% of the normal timetable.During the coronavirus pandemic only half of normal rail services have been running.The easing of travel restrictions is likely to be done gradually - the government has suggested that working hours might be staggered to limit passenger numbers.People in England who are allowed to return to work have been asked not to use public transport if possible.If maintained, the two-metre social distancing measure would cut capacity on trains by up to 90%.A recent Transport Focus survey suggested more than 60% of UK passengers would not feel comfortable using public transport unless social distancing was in place.It found 51% would not be happy unless passengers were required to wear masks.",15 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: 'My heart ruled my head' - rise in romance scams,"Organised criminals will be exploiting loneliness during lockdown to take money from romance scam victims, a charity has said.Victim Support said people's increased confidence in using the internet to meet and talk leaves them vulnerable.Research in one region shows romance scam victims are groomed, then tricked out of an average of £47,000.One has spoken of how her ""heart ruled my head"" when sending money to the man she thought she loved.Mary, not her real name, was already in the fraudsters' grip before the coronavirus outbreak.But, as the virus started to spread, she believed he was in a country heavily affected, giving him the opportunity to trick more money out of her.She was also feeling the kind of loneliness common among many vulnerable people during the current crisis. The 62-year-old, who is a widow, met ""Arnold"" after using a dating site for the very first time.She said they spoke morning, noon and night for five months about a shared love of music and family.But the man she thought was an American living overseas was, in fact, a organised criminal gang working shifts to private message or speak to her over a crackly line.""There were red flags, but I kept denying them,"" she said. ""You think you have found the love of your life, and invest yourself 100% into the relationship.""After about a month, Arnold told her stories such as suffering from an accident, his need for a working laptop, and business problems. He told her how worried he was by the coronavirus outbreak, an event that give him another chance to ask for money.She sent him funds via money transfer, and followed his request not to tell anyone because ""he would be embarrassed when he eventually met members of the family"".She ended up sending thousands of pounds. The money is now lost. It came from savings for a car or a holiday, and included some money that belonged to her daughter, who she first lied to rather than come clean about the loss.""Eventually I knew I could not lie to my daughter anymore,"" she said. ""It is the emotions that you are left to deal with which is the hard part. I cannot trust anyone, and there is a lot of grief.""In a fantasy world, I let myself think he is going to turn up and be real. You can be too emotionally involved in it.""This ""addiction"" to hear someone saying nice things to you, and which blinds you to the reality, is common among victims, according to Lisa Mills, senior fraud manager at Victim Support in Sussex.During the current lockdown, when ""the feelings of loneliness can be overwhelming"", the risks were all the greater, she said.Sussex police run Operation Signature, a campaign to identify and support vulnerable victims of fraud.Romance scam cases were increasing, Mrs Mills said, even before lockdown - a picture reflected nationwide. Criminal gangs ""meet"" people on dating sites, then take the conversation onto private messaging, build up a picture of their victim, then take any opportunity to steal money from them.Source: Action FraudMrs Mills said that, in her experience, victims were split fairly evenly between men and women, with some losing so much money they were forced to remortgage their home.Most struggled to accept they had been scammed, even after the language used in messages was analysed to show they must have been written by different people in a gang, not just one individual.There is thought to be huge under-reporting of these scams, for the same reason.""It has never been more important to reach out and know how to protect people,"" Mrs Mills said, urging anyone who may be concerned not to feel embarrassed but to seek help.",15 May 2020,business

Coronavirus: Lloyd's of London says claims to be biggest since 9/11,"Insurance market Lloyd's of London has said it expects coronavirus-related claims to cost it $3bn to $4.3bn (£2.5bn to £3.5bn).That means its biggest payout since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US.The losses could rise further if the current lockdown continues into another quarter, Lloyd's said.Insurers around the world have been hit by the cost of the pandemic, although many would-be claimants have found the virus is not covered by their policies.Lloyd's said its payout on coronavirus claims would also equal the combined impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017.Those three hurricanes brought devastation to the Caribbean and parts of the US, in what is reckoned to be the costliest year for storms on record.Lloyd's chief executive John Neal told the BBC ""it could be two years before everyone really gets their arms around the true cost of this pandemic"". ""We estimate that government borrowing could be as much as $10trn globally to protect the economy for the losses that we've seen,"" he added. He also implied that between $1bn-$1.4bn has been paid by Lloyds members for business interruption claims because of coronavirus, despite the fact that the vast majority of businesses ""don't have the right cover and the right protection in force for this type of event"". Mr Neal said that there were ""some pretty harsh lessons"" to take away from the pandemic, and that the insurance market would need to structure policies and covers differently in future so that businesses are ""protected more completely"".""Importantly, these natural catastrophes were geographically contained events, occurring over the course of hours and days - vastly different in nature to the global, systemic and longer-term impact of Covid-19,"" Lloyd's said.Mr Neal said the global insurance industry was paying out on ""a very wide range of policies"" to support business and people affected by the pandemic.He added: ""What makes Covid-19 unique is not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock. ""Taking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before, but we will keep focused on supporting our customers and continuing to pay claims over the weeks and months ahead.""Nearly a third of the insurance losses are expected to come from the cancellation or postponement of major events around the world, including the Tokyo Olympics, which are now due to take place in 2021.Other major categories include business interruption claims on property insurance.Many small businesses in the UK are at loggerheads with insurers who they say have denied them payments for disruption. The insurers say most small business policies do not cover the pandemic.One Lloyd's of London insurer, Hiscox, has said it will not pay out on business interruption claims resulting from the virus outbreak.Lloyd's said its total payouts arising from the 9/11 attacks were $4.7bn, while the 2017 hurricanes led to combined payouts of $4.8bn.Lloyd's said that once all factors were taken into account, the total impact of coronavirus on the insurance industry as a whole was likely to be far bigger.""The estimated 2020 underwriting losses covered by the industry as a result of Covid-19 are approximately $107bn,"" it said.""In addition, unlike other events, the industry will also experience falls in investment portfolios of an estimated $96bn, bringing the total projected loss to the insurance industry to $203bn.""",14 May 2020,business
McLaren offers classic cars to secure virus help,"McLaren is considering raising money by mortgaging its historic car collection and factory to see it through the coronavirus crisis.The Formula One team owner and supercar maker has seen sales and F1 advertising revenues hit as countries globally went into lockdown.Cars on show at McLaren's Surrey HQ include F1 winners from the 1980s and '90s and Le Mans competitors.McLaren would not disclose details, but said it was exploring funding options.A spokesman said: ""Like many other British businesses McLaren has been severely affected by the current pandemic and we are therefore exploring a variety of different funding options to help navigate these short-term business interruptions.""But it is understood a possible option is raising up to £300m in loans secured against McLaren's high-tech production factory and racing car collection, including those driven by the legendary Ayrton Senna.The loans would be repaid once car sales pick up and the F1 season, currently suspended, returns to normalMcLaren Group consists of three divisions, the F1 racing team, the supercar operation, and the technology research arm.Group revenues last year were up 18% to £1.4bn.

Coronavirus: Government faces WW2-sized bill for tackling virus,"The cost of the government's efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic has risen to £123.2bn, according to latest estimates from the government's independent economics forecaster.The Office for Budget Responsibility's previous estimate was £103.7bn. The increased cost of the government's furlough scheme is the main cause.It now expects annual borrowing to equal 15.2% of the UK economy.That would be the highest since the 22.1% seen at the end of World War Two.The extra spending has pushed the deficit identified for 2020-21 in the OBR's reference scenario, which it says is not a formal forecast, above the 15% in 1945-46, which included VE Day.Borrowing for this year is calculated to be £298bn, up £26bn on the first attempt to calculate the impact of the pandemic a month ago. This is mainly because of the extra costs of extending the furlough scheme to the end of July. Including the extra extension of a modified scheme until October could add an additional £20bn, depending on the as yet unannounced details of the scheme.The OBR also reckons that taxpayers could end up footing a big bill for bad bank loans.Some £5bn in taxpayer cost from unpaid loans to banks is included in this financial year. An extra £1bn is already earmarked for the cost of welfare, mainly spiralling claims for Universal Credit.The OBR's last official forecast at the Budget anticipated annual borrowing by the government of £55bn, rather than £298bn, says BBC economics editor Faisal Islam.The difference in just two months - the result of the pandemic and shutdowns - is a £127bn hit to the money that government takes in, mainly expected tax revenues, and £119bn in extra spending to support the economy over the year, our editor adds.As Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, explains, the extra spending is ""fantastic good news"" for ordinary people at the moment, because it means that the government is paying many people's wages when they might otherwise be struggling.But he adds: ""Beyond that, there's a point at which people will have to start thinking, 'How do we pay for all this?'""That's when it becomes relevant in a bad way further down the line. We will have to pay for it, either by taxes going up or by spending being cut.""It's a two-step process. In the near term, it's helping people out, but there will be consequences in the future.""",14 May 2020,business
Fed warns of slow recovery without more virus relief,"Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has warned that America faces a slow and painful economic recovery without additional government relief.The dark forecast from the head of the US central bank is a turnaround from early April, when he said he expected a robust rebound.It comes as lawmakers debate additional spending to shield the US economy from coronavirus shutdowns.Mr Powell said further measures would be ""costly but worth it"".Employers in the US cut more than 20 million jobs last month, sending the unemployment rate to 14.7%, with the many of the losses falling on poor and minority households. Analysts expect the jobless rate to climb further in May, before starting to subside.Mr Powell said on Wednesday that unemployment levels are likely to to remain elevated - particularly compared to the 50-year lows the US labour market enjoyed as recently as February. ""There is a growing sense...that the recovery will come more slowly than we would like, but it will come and that may mean that it is necessary for us to do more,"" he said in a video conference hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Financial markets sank following the comments, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending more than 2% lower.The US has already approved nearly $3tn (£2.5tn) in new spending - packages worth an estimated 14% of the country's economy. The Fed has also taken radical steps to shore up the economy, pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system.While Democrats this week proposed an additional $3tn package, Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republicans in the Senate, responded that there was ""no urgency"" to act.Some in Washington are leery of further spending, pointing to America's skyrocketing national debt.But Mr Powell said now was not the time for those worries.""We know that long periods of unemployment leave a shadow...we also know that waves of bankruptcies can weigh on economic activity for years,"" he stressed. ""Now, when we are facing the biggest shock that the economy has had in modern times, is for me, not the time to prioritise considerations like that.""I do think that we can come back to them fairly quickly, which is to say a few years down the road when the economy is well and truly recovered, or at least recovering.""While the Fed casts itself as politically neutral, Mr Powell has spent much of his tenure as chair of the bank facing political battles. Prior to the pandemic, he was a repeated target of criticism by President Donald Trump, who wanted the Fed to do more to help the economy.At a press conference on Wednesday, however, Mr Trump described Mr Powell as an ""MIP"".""You know what an MIP is? Most improved player,"" he said.",14 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Uber tells all drivers to wear face masks,"Uber drivers and passengers in most countries will have to wear face masks from next week as the ride-hailing firm toughens its coronavirus policy.The new rule takes effect on Monday. It applies to services in the US, Canada, Mexico, India and most of Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.But the UK is not on the list, following government guidance which advises but does not require people to wear face coverings in confined spaces.Although it is not making it compulsory to wear a face mask in the UK, Uber said it had distributed free protective equipment to UK drivers, including more than a million single-use face masks, as well as 95,000 cleaning sprays. In the coming weeks, it will hand out another two million masks. ""As well as working with Unilever to provide drivers with free sanitising products, Uber is distributing millions of masks and directly reimbursing drivers if they choose to source the PPE themselves,"" an Uber spokesman told the BBC. At the same time, Uber, along with taxi firm Addison Lee, has announced new safety measures as the government looks to ease coronavirus restrictions and people return to work.Addison Lee will fit perspex partition screens between drivers and passengers across its 4,000 vehicles next week.And Uber is paying the AA to install partitions in 400 cars in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham as part of an initial pilot.""We know there is significant demand from drivers, passengers, businesses and the general public for more to be done to make transport cleaner and safer as we go back to work - including calls for the introduction of partition screens into private hire vehicles,"" said Liam Griffin, chief executive of London-based Addison Lee.""That's why we have taken the decision to begin rolling out the installation of safety screens between drivers and passenger seats.""Uber said its pilot in the North East of England was crucial for the company to get a better understanding of how to carry passengers on journeys as safely as possible.Uber is first trialling the partition screens in areas where it has been able to gain the permission of the regulator or city council, in order to ensure that the screens are installed safely. On Wednesday, Transport for London (TfL) updated its guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle firms. The regulator is advising firms to have drivers and passengers socially distance, with passengers sitting in the back seats of cars. It advised drivers to carry a bottle of hand sanitiser gel in their vehicle that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, when it comes to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks, gloves or partition walls, TfL said it is waiting to hear from the London Strategic Coordination Group (SCG) on recommendations before mandating additional coronavirus prevention and control measures for taxis and private hire vehicles. The BBC understands that a number of taxi firms in the UK are seeking clarification from the government on health and safety precautions to take once the lockdown ends, and would prefer regulation rather than advice.In Wales, taxi drivers told the BBC they experience anxiety with every passenger they pick up, and are still waiting for approval from their local councils before they can make any modifications to their vehicles, such as installing a screen. ""Two months into a public health emergency which has seen private hire drivers suffer one of the highest occupational mortality rates, yet TfL and the Department for Transport (DfT) are still not taking responsibility to introduce necessary safety controls,"" James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers trade body, told the BBC.""Poor regulatory standards and employment misclassification has become a lethal combination for desperately exploited drivers.""The trade body is similarly concerned that Uber is not providing partition screens to its drivers in other parts of the UK, such as London, which has the largest concentration of Uber drivers in the country. Mr Farrar wants to see Uber commit to limiting bookings to no more than two passengers per vehicle, and to make the wearing of masks mandatory for both drivers and passengers. For now, there is no evidence available that demonstrates that partitions in taxis will reduce the risk of transmitting the coronavirus. But there is some evidence that the use of cloth face coverings can help to reduce transmission of coronavirus infection where it is not possible for people to maintain a distance of 2m.",14 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: How can the car industry hope to recover?,"For weeks, the UK's motor industry has been in suspended animation.Showrooms have been closed. Vast factories, which normally produce hundreds of cars every day for sale here and abroad, have been standing idle. But now the sector is slowly shuddering back to life.So far only a handful of factories have resumed operations, among them BMW's engine plant at Hams Hall, just outside Birmingham, Bentley's headquarters in Crewe, and Toyota's engine facility at Deeside, North Wales.Others will follow next week, including the BMW Mini plant near Oxford, Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR's) sites in Solihull and Wolverhampton, Ford's engine factories in Dagenham and Bridgend, and Vauxhall's van manufacturing facility in Luton.But Nissan's factory in Sunderland will remain closed until June, JLR has yet to say when its Castle Bromwich and Halewood plants will reopen, and it is a similar story with Vauxhall's other site at Ellesmere Port.The trend is broadly similar in Europe, where major manufacturers such as PSA Group, Renault and Daimler are slowly bringing plants back online. Among those that have already reopened is the world's largest car factory, Volkswagen's huge facility in its home town of Wolfsburg.Part of the problem is that although car companies can decide when to reopen their plants, and to what extent they can resume production, there are other factors that they cannot control. Notably, they don't know when showrooms will be allowed to reopen, and when customers will actually want to buy new cars.The earliest that showrooms could potentially unlock their doors again in England is 1 June, as that is the date that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set for when ""non-essential"" retailers will hopefully be allowed to reopen. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not put down target dates.Vauxhall's managing director Stephen Norman has told BBC Newsnight that he wants UK showrooms to open as soon as possible.In the meantime, car buyers in England will now be able to order a vehicle online, and then go and pick it up from outside a dealership, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) trade body said on Wednesday. But under this ""click and collect"" scheme, the showrooms will remain closed.The future, for an industry that it is claimed supports more than 800,000 jobs in the UK, remains deeply uncertain.The crisis in the car industry began in February, when the Covid-19 outbreak in China forced factories to close, and sales in the country - one of its biggest global markets - collapsed. As the disease spread, so too did the disruption. An outbreak in Italy and the introduction of lockdowns there threatened European supply chains, and worse was to come as further restrictions were put in place in France. By mid-March shutdowns in the UK had become inevitable.There were three main concerns for manufacturers. Parts supplies were drying up because much of what was needed came from abroad. At the same time, showrooms were closing, and companies were becoming increasingly worried about the health of their staff.""These factors were all coming together at the same time,"" explains Jim Crosbie, managing director of Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK.""Demand had obviously dropped away, we were starting to get concerns about supply, and then of course the government was clearly taking more strict measures around safety.""Since then, we've had a skeleton crew going into each plant, just to make sure equipment was ticking over.""Car companies are accustomed to halting production lines from time to time, for maintenance, or to accommodate new designs, for example. But in this case, restarting the factories is much more of a challenge - largely because of the need to make them ""Covid-safe"" to protect staff from infection.Each manufacturer has its own plans. Vauxhall, for example, says it has put in place more than 100 measures to ensure the safety of employees at its plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton, when they reopen.Workers will have their temperatures checked on site, will wear safety glasses and masks, and will be expected to maintain a safe distance from one another.Similar steps are being taken at Toyota. The company restarted its engine plant on Deeside this week, to cater for demand from overseas markets. Its car assembly factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire is expected to resume work later this month. There is now a strong emphasis on maintaining social distancing in the factories. ""We have floor markings in all areas, but we've also changed some of our processes,"" explains Toyota's Deeside plant boss Tim Freeman.""We've put screening up to segregate certain processes. And where our employees take their breaks in rest areas, we've limited the occupancy of those areas, and created some temporary additional rest areas.""He says employees will also be given a ""multi-tool"" to do things like opening doors or operating push-button microwaves, in order to avoid touching surfaces that could harbour infection.All workers will have to wear masks and each of them will have an individual bottle of hand sanitiser to use. These measures, Mr Freeman stresses, have been drawn up in consultation with Unite, the factory workers' union.Unite representative Pete Tsouvallaris says he is very happy with the measures that have been drawn up. The problem now, he believes, is persuading shop floor staff that they really can come to work safely.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:""Many of our members are obviously worried because they haven't been on site yet,"" he says. ""Those who have been on site and have seen the steps that are being taken are less concerned. But what really doesn't help is the mixed messages coming from the government. It's confusing.""For Mr Tsouvallaris, the main concern is what happens when production gets under way in earnest. He is worried that workers might find it difficult to maintain all the new precautions.""Building cars is uncomfortable at the best of times,"" he says, ""so what is going to happen when it gets hot and you're wearing masks and lots of PPE?""The risk, he says, is that if production rates rise too quickly workers might become careless. He thinks it is essential that managers stay ""reasonable"" with their demands.He is also worried about what could happen at smaller suppliers, who have smaller premises and fewer resources than the big car firms. Reopening factories is just part of the story, however. Although some cars are sold online or through other remote channels, most still find their way to buyers through dealer showrooms - and in the UK, those showrooms remain closed.So it is no surprise that the first factories to reopen are those supplying markets abroad. JLR's Solihull plant, for example, makes models that are popular in China - where sales are recovering.Graham Hoare, chairman of Ford of Britain, thinks it is vital that British showrooms are able to open as soon as possible.""Dealerships being open is a fundamental requirement to selling cars,"" he says. ""The vast majority of our products go through dealerships.""Opening those dealerships… that really unblocks the cork out of the bottle that then allows the whole manufacturing system to flow.""That's already happened on the continent - in Germany and the rest of Europe. It's building, and we need to do the same here.""People will only buy cars if they can afford them though, and with the economy expected to go into a steep recession, that can not be guaranteed.""Invariably, if consumer confidence is low, you're looking at tightening belts,"" admits Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT.Nevertheless, he says it is essential that showrooms reopen soon.""If you reopen retail, you can stimulate demand… and that will help manufacturing. Do that right and the benefits in terms of the economy, and in terms of people's jobs and livelihoods will be felt pretty quickly.""",14 May 2020,business
The robot assistant that can guess what you want,"Thomas Roszak was working as a maintenance technician at Ocado's giant warehouse in Hatfield when he received a very unusual assignment.His regular job involved repairing and maintaining the online supermarket's automated sorting and packing system, which puts together grocery orders from customers.It can be physically demanding work, manipulating heavy panels and working with other pieces of bulky machinery.In a project designed to ease that burden, Ocado Technology, had been developing a robot that can recognise when a technician might need help and step in with either the right tool or help with lifting.Mr Roszak was asked to help test the machine and when he saw it for the first time, was taken back to his childhood,""I grew up on movies like The Terminator, so when I saw that robot I was actually impressed with what it looked like. You can actually imagine it looks like a man.""For Mr Roszak, the robot's strength was a real asset. One test job involved removing a heavy metal plate from above head height.A human would struggle to hold the plate for more than two or three minutes, but the robot found it ""easy"" to hold the plate in place, while Mr Roszak undid the bolts. Mr Roszak's experience was early on in the project, called SecondHands, which involved Ocado and researchers at four European universities and funded by the European Union.The goal was to build a collaborative robot, or cobot, based on the ARMAR-6 robot, developed at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.The project ended on 4 May and, while the robot is still a long way from becoming a regular feature in workplaces, the researchers feel they have made important progress, by bringing together robot arms and hands, vision systems, voice recognition and knitting it all together with an artificial intelligence (AI).It was an ambitious project, says Graham Deacon, robotics research fellow at Ocado Technology, because they didn't want a robot that would just respond to commands, they wanted the machine to actually anticipate what the technician needed.""The key point about the whole thing was that we will have a robot system that could kind of watch what the maintenance technicians were doing, understand what activity they were engaged in, and then proactively offer the appropriate assistance at the right point in time,"" he says.So the robot's AI was trained by watching humans perform tasks.""I would say 80% of the skills of the robot were really learned from human demonstration,"" says Prof Tamim Asfour from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).That was important as it is much faster to train AI that way than to programme instructions from scratch, says Prof Asfour.The team also wanted the robot to recognise speech and respond in a natural way.""The breakthroughs made in areas like natural language interfaces and task understanding will lead to better acceptance of cobots by humans, and allow them to be used in a more easy, natural way,"" says Sebastian Stüker, from KIT.To be useful robots have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous to humans. Most industrial robot arms have to operate behind cages, because they would skittle any human that strayed into their path.To ensure their machine could work side-by-side with a human, the SecondHands robot has a sophisticated vision system, with five cameras which track the movements of its human co-worker and identify objects, such as tools.It has also been trained to recognise when to use appropriate force. ""One of the requirements in the design to build the arms... is they actually recognise collisions with the body of humans and stop immediately,"" says Prof Asfour.More Technology of BusinessProf Nathan Lepora is head of the tactile robotics group at Bristol Robotics Laboratory (who were not involved in the SecondHands project), and he agrees this has been an ambitious project.""This is enormously challenging. You are trying to reproduce capabilities that only humans currently possess: to work alongside other humans. It required expertise in building humanoid robots, online learning where the robot teaches itself to do tasks, and sophisticated computer vision to navigate and interact with the environment,"" he says.Prof Lepora says the SecondHands project reminds him of the PR2 robot made and sold by Willow Garage a decade ago. ""However, the ARMAR-6 benefits from much more dexterous hands, and also there have been huge advances in AI over the last decade, particularly in computer vision, which are now extending into robot learning - robots learning from instructors or by themselves how to do tasks and jobs.""Asimo, made by Japanese industrial giant Honda, is perhaps the world's best known robot. It can run and climb stairs. The eventual goal is for it to help people in the home, but Honda admits it is still not ready to do that.But with its ability to anticipate and communicate, the ARMAR-6 robot is potentially much more useful.""Asimo is able to respond to its name and recognises sounds associated with a falling object or collision, but ARMAR-6 can understand much more and even ask qualifying questions like 'which tool do you need?'"" says Graham Deacon from Ocado Technology.""The ARMAR-6's cognitive and speech capabilities make it much more interactive, and in a natural way - a prerequisite for a truly interactive and co-operative cobot,"" he adds.So what happens next, now the five-year project is over? At the moment the ARMAR-6 has only been tested on a small set of tasks. Much more work has to be done to extend its range, and beyond that it would need certification to prove it could work safely alongside humans.Mr Deacon declines to speculate as to when that might be, but is hopeful it will happen,""The results of this project have shown categorically how robots can amplify the benefits of human expertise. We'll continue to build on these learnings, looking forward to a future where we can use these breakthroughs to apply them to a real world setting.""",12 May 2020,business
The high-flying circus firm for pop and rock stars,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Billy Alwen and Julian Bracey, founders of UK circus performance business Cirque Bijou.Many of us dream of quitting our nine-to-five jobs, to, as the saying goes, ""run away and join the circus"". Billy Alwen did just that - literally - when he quit a fledgling career in politics in 1992, aged 25, to become a full-time circus performer. A few years later, in 1999, he set up Bristol-based Cirque Bijou with his friend Julian Bracey.Over the past two decades their business has designed and performed large open-air spectacles at cultural events around the world, from Glastonbury Festival, to Olympic Games, to New Year celebrations in the Far East.At the same time, its staff go on tour with singers and bands such as Taylor Swift, Katy Perry and Muse, to bring their performances alive with fire performers, tight-rope walkers, and even giant robots.Londoner Billy had been all set for a life in politics. After getting a degree in international relations from Staffordshire University, he spent three years working as a political researcher in the House of Commons.But in his spare time he had started training as a trapeze artist, and in 1992 he walked away from the day job to become a full-time professional circus performer.""I knew my heart lay in performing,"" says Billy, now 53.He started to get work with circuses, and performed at private parties and festivals.Meanwhile, Julian Bracey, who is from Bristol, studied design at university in the 1990s. He had won a scholarship to enrol on a prestigious course at the University of Montreal.On the streets of the Canadian city he says he was exposed to a lot of circus and street performance.""I would see people busking in a market, and think, 'I can do that,'"" says Julian, 50. So he ditched his plans for a career in design.""I ended up street performing all around the world, as a fire performer, acrobat, unicyclist and juggler.""Then I joined a French circus, working as a compere. I wasn't fluent in any other languages, but I learnt the whole show in French, and even Spanish.""Returning to the UK, Julian joined a Bristol-based circus group, where Billy was by then working.When they decided to go into business together they had no money to invest other than what they were continuing to earn from ad-hoc performance work.To keep costs down they made do with a couple of computers, and based themselves in Julian's father's basement.Billy says they decided to stay in Bristol because ""it has a thriving arts scene, and is a renowned centre for circus in the UK"".But why the French name, which translates as ""Elegant Circus""? Julian explains: ""At the time, being an English circus wasn't that cool, so we thought we should give ourselves a French name, hence Cirque Bijou.""The business then grew steadily over the years, thanks to word of mouth, and Julian's excellent contacts. ""I had a little black book, and I knew lots of people, as I had travelled a lot,"" he says.""I was quite protective of our contacts. That's changed now because of social media, it's now more inclusive. You can now see someone on TV, Google their name, and say, 'Hey, do you want to be in our show?'""More The Boss features:As the company grew, Billy and Julian both quickly gave up performing themselves, to instead focus on the production work.Over the years they have produced spectacles such as the annual Taiwan Lantern Festival, an international exhibition in Kazakhstan, and the opening ceremonies for the sailing events at the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in the UK.The show for the Paralympics involved 64 disabled and non-disabled performers. Billy was so inspired by the experience that he formed a side company called Extraordinary Bodies, where disabled and non-disabled artists can work equally together.""It's something I'm incredibly proud of."" he says. ""Also, if you change who you see on stage it changes who the audience are.""When you add Cirque Bijou's work with music artists, and the company is typically involved in more than 100 shows around the world each year. To meet all its commitments, the business relies on a pool of about 200 freelance performers.Given that these men and women are often playing with fire, or walking tightropes, health and safety is a big factor.One year they worked with Katy Perry at an awards show, where she wanted Catherine wheels attached to the backpacks of all her dancers.""We strapped the fireworks to their backs, and we'd accounted for all the health and safety hazards,"" says Julian. ""But then this guy from Sony came up to us, and said, 'You realise that there's this invisible video screen behind you? It's worth £300,000, and if you burn it you are in trouble!'""That was slightly scary, but in over 20 years we have never had any accidents, which is amazing.""Typically, Billy and Julian spend lots of time travelling around the world for work, which both admit can take a toll on their personal lives. Julian says it was particularly tough when he spent five months on tour with Muse when his daughter was born. Presently though, all is on hold due to the coronavirus lockdown.""We have had around 20 events cancelled or postponed,"" says Julian. ""The summer season for live events is effectively cancelled.""The company is using the downtime to develop new shows instead.Ade Berry, artistic director at London arts and cultural venue Jacksons Lane, says Cirque Bijou has ""paved the way"" for circus performance in the UK.""It's redefining circus, and pushing organisations like us to try to achieve more, and rethink everything we know,"" says Mr Berry. He adds that Cirque Bijou's continuing work with disabled people via Extraordinary Bodies is particularly inspiring.As to the future of Cirque Bijou, Billy and Julian see it carrying on for at least another 20 years. It does sound more fun than a typical nine-to-five job.",11 May 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Coronavirus: Avanti introduces social distancing measures on its trains,"Rail passengers have been urged not to turn up at stations without an advance ticket and to wear face coverings when they travel on the West Coast Mainline.Avanti West Coast made the announcement as part of new social distancing on its services between Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds.  Passengers might be refused travel if the guidelines are not followed.The measures take effect on Monday and Avanti says it may not allow carriages to be more than a quarter full.""We're appealing to our valued customers to help us and other passengers by only travelling with a reservation,""  said Avanti West Coast's managing director Phil Whittingham.""If everyone does this, we'll be able to keep social distancing in place on board, both for our customers and our people.""If customers do turn up without a reservation, we'll do our best to help but we can't guarantee they'll be able to take the train they want.""Because of this, the train operator is asking passengers to book in advance on the Avanti mobile app where possible, to avoid using facilities at the station or handling cash.People should also check before they travel, in case the time of their train has changed.Other measures being introduced by Avanti include face masks for staff and waiting rooms and lounges will be shut. There will also be enhanced cleaning procedures onboard trains and at stations, especially focused on cleaning door buttons, grab handles, tables and all touch points, as well as equipment like phones, chip and pin machines, self-service ticket machines and point of sale systems.Shops onboard Voyager services, which travel between London and destinations like Blackpool, Shrewsbury, Birmingham, Edinburgh and North Wales, will be closed and no food and drink will be available.The shops on Pendolino services will still be open, but re-usable coffee cups will not be accepted. A new timetable is being brought in from Monday, in line with updated travel advice from the government that will see train services increase to about 70% of the normal timetable.During the coronavirus pandemic only half of normal rail services have been running.The easing of travel restrictions is likely to be done gradually - the government has suggested that working hours might be staggered to limit passenger numbers.People in England who are allowed to return to work have been asked not to use public transport if possible.If maintained, the two-metre social distancing measure would cut capacity on trains by up to 90%.A recent Transport Focus survey suggested more than 60% of UK passengers would not feel comfortable using public transport unless social distancing was in place.It found 51% would not be happy unless passengers were required to wear masks.",15 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Government faces WW2-sized bill for tackling virus,"The cost of the government's efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic has risen to £123.2bn, according to latest estimates from the government's independent economics forecaster.The Office for Budget Responsibility's previous estimate was £103.7bn. The increased cost of the government's furlough scheme is the main cause.It now expects annual borrowing to equal 15.2% of the UK economy.That would be the highest since the 22.1% seen at the end of World War Two.The extra spending has pushed the deficit identified for 2020-21 in the OBR's reference scenario, which it says is not a formal forecast, above the 15% in 1945-46, which included VE Day.Borrowing for this year is calculated to be £298bn, up £26bn on the first attempt to calculate the impact of the pandemic a month ago. This is mainly because of the extra costs of extending the furlough scheme to the end of July. Including the extra extension of a modified scheme until October could add an additional £20bn, depending on the as yet unannounced details of the scheme.The OBR also reckons that taxpayers could end up footing a big bill for bad bank loans.Some £5bn in taxpayer cost from unpaid loans to banks is included in this financial year. An extra £1bn is already earmarked for the cost of welfare, mainly spiralling claims for Universal Credit.The OBR's last official forecast at the Budget anticipated annual borrowing by the government of £55bn, rather than £298bn, says BBC economics editor Faisal Islam.The difference in just two months - the result of the pandemic and shutdowns - is a £127bn hit to the money that government takes in, mainly expected tax revenues, and £119bn in extra spending to support the economy over the year, our editor adds.As Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, explains, the extra spending is ""fantastic good news"" for ordinary people at the moment, because it means that the government is paying many people's wages when they might otherwise be struggling.But he adds: ""Beyond that, there's a point at which people will have to start thinking, 'How do we pay for all this?'""That's when it becomes relevant in a bad way further down the line. We will have to pay for it, either by taxes going up or by spending being cut.""It's a two-step process. In the near term, it's helping people out, but there will be consequences in the future.""",14 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Firms warn of shop-screen plastic shortage,"There is a shortage of the plastic sheets used to make clear screens that employers have been advised to install for workplace safety, the BBC has learned.Supermarkets have already fitted screens at checkouts.Government guidance published on Monday advised other workplaces, from labs to factories, to take a similar approach.But a spike in demand has led to shortages of some types of plastic sheets. These include acrylic, which can used as an alternative to glass; polycarbonate, which can be used to make windows; and PETG, a plastic that can be used to make water bottles:.As well as supermarkets and retailers, there is demand from other firms for plastic sheets.For example, Uber and Addison Lee are looking to put the sheets into taxis, with Uber testing them in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham.Industry body the British Plastics Federation said some companies are finding it harder to source the material, and that it is monitoring the situation. Firms that supply plastics to businesses warned of constricted supply.Chris Marmion, managing director of Plastic Shop Screens, told the BBC's Wake up to Money: ""It's quite simple. There isn't enough [plastic] coming into the country to meet the current demand.""We were warned about this approximately four weeks ago by our trusted suppliers... As the recommendations [for shops and businesses to use plastic screens] have come out we've now seen an increase in orders through the website and through the phone, and we're currently having to pre-order materials now into July to keep up with the supply chain.""One plastic products company called The Plastic Man has a banner on its website warning customers that it's out of stock until mid-June due to a ""global shortage"". No one at the business was available for comment.Wake Up to Money programme asked Mr Marmion whether some firms may not be able to make their business Covid-secure due to the shortage.""That could possibly be the case,"" he said. ""We saw this coming quite early. We've got orders for a great deal of stock all the way into July try to and keep up with the demand that's coming directly to us.""Yesterday alone we had competitors calling us, asking us whether we had any of our material available to sell directly to them.""An awful lot of companies like ourselves are placing orders to secure materials ahead of time... Come a couple of weeks, I think there may definitely be a shortage, a lot more than what we have right now.""A plastics supplier, who asked not be named, said demand was about five times higher than usual.He said: ""The bigger factories have got their own issues with regard to people who are self-isolating or recovering. It stands to reason they can't just immediately double or quadruple their output. It's like steering a tanker, it takes a long time for them to change direction.""Also every shop, business, train or bus is going to need this material so there's a huge spike in demand in a short period of time.""He added:  ""Demand is about five or six times higher than usual and it'll grow as more and more businesses get their plans in place for people coming back and shops reopening.""A spokesman for the British Plastics Federation said: ""Some companies are reporting it is harder to get hold of these materials and the time it takes to receive deliveries has increased. ""The BPF will continue to monitor this complex situation as best we can to advise the government about the supply of these and other essential plastic products.""",14 May 2020,business
