Coronavirus: Lloyd's of London says claims to be biggest since 9/11,"Insurance market Lloyd's of London has said it expects coronavirus-related claims to cost it $3bn to $4.3bn (£2.5bn to £3.5bn).That means its biggest payout since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US.The losses could rise further if the current lockdown continues into another quarter, Lloyd's said.Insurers around the world have been hit by the cost of the pandemic, although many would-be claimants have found the virus is not covered by their policies.Lloyd's said its payout on coronavirus claims would also equal the combined impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017.Those three hurricanes brought devastation to the Caribbean and parts of the US, in what is reckoned to be the costliest year for storms on record.""Importantly, these natural catastrophes were geographically contained events, occurring over the course of hours and days - vastly different in nature to the global, systemic and longer-term impact of Covid-19,"" Lloyd's said.Lloyd's chief executive John Neal said the global insurance industry was paying out on ""a very wide range of policies"" to support business and people affected by the pandemic.He added: ""What makes Covid-19 unique is not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock. ""Taking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before, but we will keep focused on supporting our customers and continuing to pay claims over the weeks and months ahead.""Nearly a third of the insurance losses are expected to come from the cancellation or postponement of major events around the world, including the Tokyo Olympics, which are now due to take place in 2021.Other major categories include business interruption claims on property insurance.Many small businesses in the UK are at loggerheads with insurers who they say have denied them payments for disruption. The insurers say most small business policies do not cover the pandemic.One Lloyd's of London insurer, Hiscox, has said it will not pay out on business interruption claims resulting from the virus outbreak.Lloyd's said its total payouts arising from the 9/11 attacks were $4.7bn, while the 2017 hurricanes led to combined payouts of $4.8bn.Lloyd's said that once all factors were taken into account, the total impact of coronavirus on the insurance industry as a whole was likely to be far bigger.""The estimated 2020 underwriting losses covered by the industry as a result of Covid-19 are approximately $107bn,"" it said.""In addition, unlike other events, the industry will also experience falls in investment portfolios of an estimated $96bn, bringing the total projected loss to the insurance industry to $203bn.""",14 May 2020,business

Fed warns of slow recovery without more virus relief,"Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has warned that America faces a slow and painful economic recovery without additional government relief.The dark forecast from the head of the US central bank is a turnaround from early April, when he said he expected a robust rebound.It comes as lawmakers debate additional spending to shield the US economy from coronavirus shutdowns.Mr Powell said further measures would be ""costly but worth it"".Employers in the US cut more than 20 million jobs last month, sending the unemployment rate to 14.7%, with the many of the losses falling on poor and minority households. Analysts expect the jobless rate to climb further in May, before starting to subside.Mr Powell said on Wednesday that unemployment levels are likely to to remain elevated - particularly compared to the 50-year lows the US labour market enjoyed as recently as February. ""There is a growing sense...that the recovery will come more slowly than we would like, but it will come and that may mean that it is necessary for us to do more,"" he said in a video conference hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Financial markets sank following the comments, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending more than 2% lower.The US has already approved nearly $3tn (£2.5tn) in new spending - packages worth an estimated 14% of the country's economy. The Fed has also taken radical steps to shore up the economy, pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system.While Democrats this week proposed an additional $3tn package, Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republicans in the Senate, responded that there was ""no urgency"" to act.Some in Washington are leery of further spending, pointing to America's skyrocketing national debt.But Mr Powell said now was not the time for those worries.""We know that long periods of unemployment leave a shadow...we also know that waves of bankruptcies can weigh on economic activity for years,"" he stressed. ""Now, when we are facing the biggest shock that the economy has had in modern times, is for me, not the time to prioritise considerations like that.""I do think that we can come back to them fairly quickly, which is to say a few years down the road when the economy is well and truly recovered, or at least recovering.""While the Fed casts itself as politically neutral, Mr Powell has spent much of his tenure as chair of the bank facing political battles. Prior to the pandemic, he was a repeated target of criticism by President Donald Trump, who wanted the Fed to do more to help the economy.At a press conference on Wednesday, however, Mr Trump described Mr Powell as an ""MIP"".""You know what an MIP is? Most improved player,"" he said.",14 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Uber and Addison Lee to install protective screens,"Taxi firms Addison Lee and Uber have announced new safety measures as the government looks to ease coronavirus restrictions and people return to work.Addison Lee will fit perspex partition screens between drivers and passengers across its 4,000 vehicles next week.And Uber is paying the AA to install partitions in 400 cars in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham as part of an initial pilot.Both firms are also distributing free protective equipment to drivers.The plans follow calls for improved protections for drivers and passengers.""We know there is significant demand from drivers, passengers, businesses and the general public for more to be done to make transport cleaner and safer as we go back to work - including calls for the introduction of partition screens into private hire vehicles,"" said Liam Griffin, chief executive of London-based taxi firm Addison Lee.""That's why we have taken the decision to begin rolling out the installation of safety screens between drivers and passenger seats.""Ride hailing taxi app firm Uber said its pilot in the North East of England was crucial for the company to get a better understanding of how to carry passengers on journeys as safely as possible.Uber is first trialling the partition screens in areas where it has been able to gain the permission of the regulator or city council, in order to ensure that the screens are installed safely. On Wednesday, Transport for London (TfL) updated its guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle firms. The regulator is advising firms to have drivers and passengers socially distance, with passengers sitting in the back seats of cars. It advised drivers to carry a bottle of hand sanitiser gel in their vehicle that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, when it comes to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) like face masks, gloves or partition walls, TfL said it is waiting to hear from the London Strategic Coordination Group (SCG) on recommendations before mandating additional coronavirus prevention and control measures for taxis and private hire vehicles. The BBC understands that multiple taxi firms in the UK are seeking clarification from the government on health and safety precautions to take once the lockdown, and would prefer regulation rather than advice.In Wales, taxi drivers told the BBC they experience anxiety with every passenger they pick up, and are still waiting for approval from their local councils before they can make any modifications to their vehicles, such as installing a screen. ""Two months into a public health emergency which has seen private hire drivers suffer one of the highest occupational mortality rates, yet TfL and the Department for Transport (DfT) are still not taking responsibility to introduce necessary safety controls,"" James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers trade body, told the BBC.""Poor regulatory standards and employment misclassification has become a lethal combination for desperately exploited drivers.""The trade body is similarly concerned that Uber is not providing partition screens to its drivers in other parts of the UK, such as London, which has the largest concentration of Uber drivers in the country. Mr Farrar wants to see Uber commit to limiting bookings to no more than two passengers per vehicle, and to make the wearing of masks mandatory for both drivers and passengers. For now, there is no evidence available that demonstrates that partitions in taxis will reduce the risk of transmitting the coronavirus. But there is some evidence that the use of cloth face coverings can help to reduce transmission of coronavirus infection where it is not possible for people to maintain a distance of 2m.Many firms have already started distributing PPE to their drivers after hearing concerns from both drivers and passengers. Uber has so far handed out over a million single-use face masks to drivers, as well as 95,000 cleaning sprays. And in the coming weeks, it will hand out another two million masks.

New York City caps fees for food delivery apps,"New York City has placed limits on how much food delivery apps can charge restaurants that use their platforms.The proposal, which was put to a vote on Wednesday, will cap fees at 20% and apply in emergency situations when restaurants must be shut.There have been complaints about fees charged by tech firms amid skyrocketing deliveries during the lockdown.Other US cities such as San Francisco, Washington and Seattle have also introduced tighter rules for the apps.Grubhub, the owner of online food ordering service Seamless and the biggest player in the US market, warned that the city's cap would raise costs for customers and reduce opportunities for workers. The firm said the law was ""an overstep"" by local officials and would not withstand legal challenge.""Any arbitrary cap - regardless of the duration - will lower order volume to locally-owned restaurants, increase costs for small business owners and raise costs on consumers,"" said Grubhub.""Delivery workers would have fewer work opportunities and lower earnings.""The New York City Council had started discussing ways to limit the fees charged by mobile apps before the pandemic hit.But the crisis for restaurants triggered by shutdown orders injected new urgency into the effort, as many restaurants found themselves reliant on food delivery apps such as Grubhub, Doordash and UberEats, for business.The firms currently charge restaurants a range that can exceed 30% per order, with fees for services including marketing, taking customer orders and fulfilling delivery. These fees can be punishing in an industry where the profit margins typically hover around 10%.George Constantinou, who runs restaurants in New York and New Jersey, told the BBC in April that he was trying to negotiate lower rates for his business, describing the commissions as unsustainable.""When you have a full dining room and you're already paying for your cooks and your staff to be there it's one thing, but when you don't have that dining room, it hurts you,"" he said.Last month, three restaurants filed a class-action lawsuit in New York, accusing Grubhub, Doordash, Postmates and Uber Eats of exerting monopoly power that led to exorbitant fees and restrictions on restaurants.Reports this week that Uber and Grubhub are planning to merge have only heightened those concerns. While delivery apps have announced their own relief to restaurants since the pandemic, taking steps to waive, reduce or defer some some of the charges, restaurant owners and their advocates say the firms have not gone far enough.On Tuesday, ahead of the vote, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he supported plans to cap the fees, calling it ""smart legislation"".

Coronavirus: Lloyd's of London says claims to be biggest since 9/11,"Insurance market Lloyd's of London has said it expects coronavirus-related claims to cost it $3bn to $4.3bn (£2.5bn to £3.5bn).That means its biggest payout since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US.The losses could rise further if the current lockdown continues into another quarter, Lloyd's said.Insurers around the world have been hit by the cost of the pandemic, although many would-be claimants have found the virus is not covered by their policies.Lloyd's said its payout on coronavirus claims would also equal the combined impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017.Those three hurricanes brought devastation to the Caribbean and parts of the US, in what is reckoned to be the costliest year for storms on record.""Importantly, these natural catastrophes were geographically contained events, occurring over the course of hours and days - vastly different in nature to the global, systemic and longer-term impact of Covid-19,"" Lloyd's said.Lloyd's chief executive John Neal said the global insurance industry was paying out on ""a very wide range of policies"" to support business and people affected by the pandemic.He added: ""What makes Covid-19 unique is not just the devastating continuing human and social impact, but also the economic shock. ""Taking all those factors together will challenge the industry as never before, but we will keep focused on supporting our customers and continuing to pay claims over the weeks and months ahead.""Nearly a third of the insurance losses are expected to come from the cancellation or postponement of major events around the world, including the Tokyo Olympics, which are now due to take place in 2021.Other major categories include business interruption claims on property insurance.Many small businesses in the UK are at loggerheads with insurers who they say have denied them payments for disruption. The insurers say most small business policies do not cover the pandemic.One Lloyd's of London insurer, Hiscox, has said it will not pay out on business interruption claims resulting from the virus outbreak.Lloyd's said its total payouts arising from the 9/11 attacks were $4.7bn, while the 2017 hurricanes led to combined payouts of $4.8bn.Lloyd's said that once all factors were taken into account, the total impact of coronavirus on the insurance industry as a whole was likely to be far bigger.""The estimated 2020 underwriting losses covered by the industry as a result of Covid-19 are approximately $107bn,"" it said.""In addition, unlike other events, the industry will also experience falls in investment portfolios of an estimated $96bn, bringing the total projected loss to the insurance industry to $203bn.""",14 May 2020,business

Many figures from the worlds of theatre, music and nightlife were angry that Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to stay away while not forcing venues to close, which they said could have given them financial protection.However, across the wider business sector, it is unlikely that insurance protection would be in place to compensate firms for their losses if they closed, whether through a government order or not.Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, which represents the leisure sector, said: ""The insurance industry have simply abdicated responsibility for the thousands of hospitality venues who have bought policies in good faith and who, through no fault of their own, are unable to trade.""Removing that safety net impacts millions of workers who depend on them for their livelihood.

Coronavirus: Uber and Addison Lee to install protective screens,"Taxi firms Addison Lee and Uber have announced new safety measures as the government looks to ease coronavirus restrictions and people return to work.Addison Lee will fit perspex partition screens between drivers and passengers across its 4,000 vehicles next week.And Uber is paying the AA to install partitions in 400 cars in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham as part of an initial pilot.Both firms are also distributing free protective equipment to drivers.The plans follow calls for improved protections for drivers and passengers.""We know there is significant demand from drivers, passengers, businesses and the general public for more to be done to make transport cleaner and safer as we go back to work - including calls for the introduction of partition screens into private hire vehicles,"" said Liam Griffin, chief executive of London-based taxi firm Addison Lee.""That's why we have taken the decision to begin rolling out the installation of safety screens between drivers and passenger seats.""Ride hailing taxi app firm Uber said its pilot in the North East of England was crucial for the company to get a better understanding of how to carry passengers on journeys as safely as possible.Uber is first trialling the partition screens in areas where it has been able to gain the permission of the regulator or city council, in order to ensure that the screens are installed safely. On Wednesday, Transport for London (TfL) updated its guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle firms. The regulator is advising firms to have drivers and passengers socially distance, with passengers sitting in the back seats of cars. It advised drivers to carry a bottle of hand sanitiser gel in their vehicle that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, when it comes to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) like face masks, gloves or partition walls, TfL said it is waiting to hear from the London Strategic Coordination Group (SCG) on recommendations before mandating additional coronavirus prevention and control measures for taxis and private hire vehicles. The BBC understands that multiple taxi firms in the UK are seeking clarification from the government on health and safety precautions to take once the lockdown, and would prefer regulation rather than advice.In Wales, taxi drivers told the BBC they experience anxiety with every passenger they pick up, and are still waiting for approval from their local councils before they can make any modifications to their vehicles, such as installing a screen. ""Two months into a public health emergency which has seen private hire drivers suffer one of the highest occupational mortality rates, yet TfL and the Department for Transport (DfT) are still not taking responsibility to introduce necessary safety controls,"" James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers trade body, told the BBC.""Poor regulatory standards and employment misclassification has become a lethal combination for desperately exploited drivers.""The trade body is similarly concerned that Uber is not providing partition screens to its drivers in other parts of the UK, such as London, which has the largest concentration of Uber drivers in the country. Mr Farrar wants to see Uber commit to limiting bookings to no more than two passengers per vehicle, and to make the wearing of masks mandatory for both drivers and passengers. For now, there is no evidence available that demonstrates that partitions in taxis will reduce the risk of transmitting the coronavirus. But there is some evidence that the use of cloth face coverings can help to reduce transmission of coronavirus infection where it is not possible for people to maintain a distance of 2m.Many firms have already started distributing PPE to their drivers after hearing concerns from both drivers and passengers. Uber has so far handed out over a million single-use face masks to drivers, as well as 95,000 cleaning sprays. And in the coming weeks, it will hand out another two million masks. Unilever is teaming up with Uber to distribute free hygiene kits that include antibacterial spray and hand sanitiser to drivers across the UK.

Coronavirus: Uber and Addison Lee to install protective screens,"Taxi firms Addison Lee and Uber have announced new safety measures as the government looks to ease coronavirus restrictions and people return to work.Addison Lee will fit perspex partition screens between drivers and passengers across its 4,000 vehicles next week.And Uber is paying the AA to install partitions in 400 cars in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham as part of an initial pilot.Both firms are also distributing free protective equipment to drivers.The plans follow calls for improved protections for drivers and passengers.""We know there is significant demand from drivers, passengers, businesses and the general public for more to be done to make transport cleaner and safer as we go back to work - including calls for the introduction of partition screens into private hire vehicles,"" said Liam Griffin, chief executive of London-based taxi firm Addison Lee.""That's why we have taken the decision to begin rolling out the installation of safety screens between drivers and passenger seats.""Ride hailing taxi app firm Uber said its pilot in the North East of England was crucial for the company to get a better understanding of how to carry passengers on journeys as safely as possible.Uber is first trialling the partition screens in areas where it has been able to gain the permission of the regulator or city council, in order to ensure that the screens are installed safely. On Wednesday, Transport for London (TfL) updated its guidance for taxi and private hire vehicle firms. The regulator is advising firms to have drivers and passengers socially distance, with passengers sitting in the back seats of cars. It advised drivers to carry a bottle of hand sanitiser gel in their vehicle that contains at least 60% alcohol. However, when it comes to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) like face masks, gloves or partition walls, TfL said it is waiting to hear from the London Strategic Coordination Group (SCG) on recommendations before mandating additional coronavirus prevention and control measures for taxis and private hire vehicles. The BBC understands that multiple taxi firms in the UK are seeking clarification from the government on health and safety precautions to take once the lockdown, and would prefer regulation rather than advice.In Wales, taxi drivers told the BBC they experience anxiety with every passenger they pick up, and are still waiting for approval from their local councils before they can make any modifications to their vehicles, such as installing a screen. ""Two months into a public health emergency which has seen private hire drivers suffer one of the highest occupational mortality rates, yet TfL and the Department for Transport (DfT) are still not taking responsibility to introduce necessary safety controls,"" James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers trade body, told the BBC.""Poor regulatory standards and employment misclassification has become a lethal combination for desperately exploited drivers.""The trade body is similarly concerned that Uber is not providing partition screens to its drivers in other parts of the UK, such as London, which has the largest concentration of Uber drivers in the country. Mr Farrar wants to see Uber commit to limiting bookings to no more than two passengers per vehicle, and to make the wearing of masks mandatory for both drivers and passengers. For now, there is no evidence available that demonstrates that partitions in taxis will reduce the risk of transmitting the coronavirus. But there is some evidence that the use of cloth face coverings can help to reduce transmission of coronavirus infection where it is not possible for people to maintain a distance of 2m.Many firms have already started distributing PPE to their drivers after hearing concerns from both drivers and passengers. Uber has so far handed out over a million single-use face masks to drivers, as well as 95,000 cleaning sprays. And in the coming weeks, it will hand out another two million masks. Unilever is teaming up with Uber to distribute free hygiene kits that include antibacterial spray and hand sanitiser to drivers across the UK. ""As well as working with Unilever to provide drivers with free sanitising products, Uber is distributing millions of masks and directly reimbursing drivers if they choose to source the PPE themselves,"" an Uber spokesman told the BBC.

New York City caps fees for food delivery apps,"New York City has placed limits on how much food delivery apps can charge restaurants that use their platforms.The proposal, which was put to a vote on Wednesday, will cap fees at 20% and apply in emergency situations when restaurants must be shut.There have been complaints about fees charged by tech firms amid skyrocketing deliveries during the lockdown.Other US cities such as San Francisco, Washington and Seattle have also introduced tighter rules for the apps.Grubhub, the owner of online food ordering service Seamless and the biggest player in the US market, warned that the city's cap would raise costs for customers and reduce opportunities for workers. The firm said the law was ""an overstep"" by local officials and would not withstand legal challenge.""Any arbitrary cap - regardless of the duration - will lower order volume to locally-owned restaurants, increase costs for small business owners and raise costs on consumers,"" said Grubhub.""Delivery workers would have fewer work opportunities and lower earnings.""The New York City Council had started discussing ways to limit the fees charged by mobile apps before the pandemic hit.But the crisis for restaurants triggered by shutdown orders injected new urgency into the effort, as many restaurants found themselves reliant on food delivery apps such as Grubhub, Doordash and UberEats, for business.The firms currently charge restaurants a range that can exceed 30% per order, with fees for services including marketing, taking customer orders and fulfilling delivery. These fees can be punishing in an industry where the profit margins typically hover around 10%.George Constantinou, who runs restaurants in New York and New Jersey, told the BBC in April that he was trying to negotiate lower rates for his business, describing the commissions as unsustainable.""When you have a full dining room and you're already paying for your cooks and your staff to be there it's one thing, but when you don't have that dining room, it hurts you,"" he said.Last month, three restaurants filed a class-action lawsuit in New York, accusing Grubhub, Doordash, Postmates and Uber Eats of exerting monopoly power that led to exorbitant fees and restrictions on restaurants.Reports this week that Uber and Grubhub are planning to merge have only heightened those concerns. While delivery apps have announced their own relief to restaurants since the pandemic, taking steps to waive, reduce or defer some some of the charges, restaurant owners and their advocates say the firms have not gone far enough.On Tuesday, ahead of the vote, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he supported plans to cap the fees, calling it ""smart legislation"". City Councilman Mark Gjonaj, a sponsor of the legislation, said he hoped the limits would provide relief.""Proud to fight for a bill that will level the playing field and help restaurants get through this crisis, as restaurant owners are being held hostage by the third party delivery apps who monopolize search results,"" he wrote on Twitter.Content is not availableAndrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance called the measure a ""critical first step"".""We look forward to working with lawmakers to enact these protections on a permanent basis,"" he said.",13 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Tesla stand-off eases as officials reach deal,"Officials in California said they may allow Tesla to restart full operations at its US car assembly plant on Monday.They also said the electric car company had been approved to resume some activities ahead of the re-opening.The announcement comes after chief executive Elon Musk called staff back to work in defiance of shutdown orders.Alameda County health officials said the approvals were subject to the firm instituting safety measures for staff and improving virus data.""We... held productive discussions today with Tesla's representatives about their safety and prevention plans, including some additional safety recommendations,"" the department said in a Twitter post overnight on Wednesday.""If Tesla's Prevention and Control Plan includes these updates, and the public health indicators remain stable or improve, we have agreed that Tesla can begin to augment their Minimum Business Operations this week in preparation for possible reopening as soon as next week.""The state of California has already eased restrictions to allow manufacturing, but Alameda County, where Tesla's factory is located, has not.  On Saturday, Mr Musk said the firm was suing Alameda County over its decision that the plant, located in Fremont about an hour south of San Francisco, should stay closed.Mr Musk, who had earlier described shutdown orders as fascist, also vowed to move the firm's headquarters out of California if the plant was not allowed to reopen.Tesla did not immediately comment on Wednesday, but around the same time the county issued its update, Musk tweeted: ""Life should be lived.""Tesla opened a plant in Shanghai last year and it is building another outside Berlin, but Fremont is home to Tesla's headquarters and its primary manufacturing facility.Pictures of the firm's car park this week have shown it as being mostly full. The plant had been closed to all but limited essential operations since 26 March.The dispute over the Tesla plant is part of the bigger debate in the US about how to re-open the economy. The discussion has split partly on political lines, with Republicans urging a faster relaxing of restrictions.US President Donald Trump and other members of the administration had called on authorities in California to allow the firm to re-open.On Tuesday, Mr Trump tweeted: ""California should let Tesla & Elon Musk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!""",13 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Tui urges opening up tourism to safer countries,"Travel firm Tui is pressing for tourism to resume to countries where the coronavirus threat has abated.It plans to reopen some hotels in Germany ""in the coming days"".The company, which says it has 27 million customers, added operations in other European destinations were also ready to welcome holidaymakers.Tui has identified Austria, Greece and Cyprus as being more viable among European destinations because the virus there appears to be contained.It was forced to cancel the majority of its travel programme in March and on Wednesday warned that up to 8,000 jobs would go as it strives to cut costs by 30% in a major restructuring.TUI has cancelled all holidays until June and cruises until July. It would normally be running hundreds of flights a week at this time of year.Travel restrictions across Europe and further afield mean that the crucial summer season for many though is still in doubt, leaving millions of holidaymakers unsure of their plans.In the UK, the Foreign Office is still advising against all non-essential foreign travel, with no indication of when the policy might change.On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was unlikely that ""big, lavish international holidays"" were going to be possible this summer.A spokesman for Tui said countries were ""knocking at its door"", eager to see it reopen hotels and bring back tourists. Tui said it was trying hard to resume operations and had worked out a number of protocols to make its holidays safe. It has a 10-point plan of guidance on how to reopen safely, including limited buffet services, restrictions on some sports and games and longer opening times at restaurants.But the company said blanket travel restrictions were making resumption impossible.Spain, for example, is introducing a 14-day quarantine period for incomers - which covers the length of most package holidays.The issue of holiday travel is becoming politically sensitive as parts of Europe begin to either recover from or emerge as less affected by the first onslaught of the virus.The European Commission said on Wednesday a summer holiday season shouldn't be ruled out this year, contrasting with the UK health secretary's comment on the unlikelihood of a trip abroad this summer. Tui chief executive Fritz Joussen said: ""The demand for holidays is still very high. People want to travel.""Our integrated business model allows us to start travel activities as soon as this is possible again. The season starts later, but could last longer. ""For 2020, we will also reinvent the holiday: new destinations, changed travel seasons, new local offerings, more digitalisation.""Tui said it was ready to resume providing holidays this year, using new social distancing and cleaning measures.""The health and well-being of both customers and colleagues remain paramount and we are assessing how we can responsibly adapt to measures so that leisure travel can resume,"" the firm said.""We are preparing new procedures for the airport process, on board our aircraft, in hotels and on our ships, so that any social distancing recommendations or guidelines can be implemented, without compromising customer enjoyment and travel experience.""Tui said its restructuring would affect its airline business and would also involve selling off ""non-profitable activities"".""We are targeting to permanently reduce our overhead cost base by 30% across the entire group. This will have an impact on potentially 8,000 roles globally that will either not be recruited or reduced,"" it said in a statement.Last month it told its UK workforce they would face a cut of up to 50% in hours worked, with a matching cut in basic pay. The firm said its turnover and earnings would be significantly lower in the current financial year, with cost savings only partly compensating for the slump.Tui, which has a global workforce of 70,000, was recently bolstered by a €1.8bn (£1.6bn) state-backed loan in Germany, where it has its headquarters.",13 May 2020,business
Vauxhall calls for showrooms to open as plant restarts,"Vauxhall will restart production at its Luton plant on Monday but is calling for showrooms to open to speed up the automotive sector's recovery.Managing director Stephen Norman told BBC Newsnight that the plant, which produces vans, would start up with only a third of its 1,600-strong workforce.The company's Ellesmere Port plant, which makes cars, remains closed. Mr Norman said the car industry needed new orders from showrooms to justify ramping up production.Most of the new vans produced at Luton are likely to be exported to Europe, where some showrooms have reopened, he added. ""We need to have orders for the vehicles we're setting out to produce,"" said Mr Norman. ""And the key blocking point that we have today as we speak is the opening of car dealerships in the United Kingdom... In fact, we'd like that to happen today and certainly at the latest at the end of this week.""The government has suggested that car showrooms could reopen from the beginning of June, depending on how the spread of Covid19 progresses.It also said that, from today, showrooms could operate a click and collect service for taking receipt of ordered vehicles. Of Ellesmere Port's continued closure, Mr Norman said: ""It's not a technical issue. It can open as soon as the demand from the United Kingdom market... but also from across the continent [is there].""Groupe PSA, Vauxhall's parent company which also owns Peugeot, Citroën and DS, employs about 5,500 people in the UK, 90% of whom have been placed in the government's furlough scheme.At Luton, Mr Norman said that the company expected to add a second shift of workers within weeks but it would take much longer to get back to its full capacity, producing 100,000 vehicles a year. He said redundancies were ""absolutely not something that we are examining today.""Demand for vans has been a relative bright spot in the automotive market, which has ground to a halt during lockdown. Registrations for new light commercial vehicles fell 86% in April, compared to a year before, compared with a 97% slump for new cars.The car industry is facing an uncertain outlook, with global sales forecast to drop by 20-25% this year. Vauxhall's plans to restart come as other car companies like Toyota and Bentley begin production, after closing their operations in late March.When production restarts next week, all staff at the Luton plant will be subject to regular temperature checks and be required to wear a mask and goggles for work, as well as observing social distancing rules. Vauxhall will allow one hour when shifts change over to clean and to ensure different team do not interact. The plant has reduced the processes that require people to work within 2 metres of each other from 150 to 50. Groupe PSA staff will also wear masks and goggles in the company's showrooms, where it has put in 2 metre markings on the floor and introduced measures to limit numbers. It will be able to offer test drives, with a member of staff sitting in the back seat.Alison Jones, managing director of Peugeot, Citroën and DS, told Newsnight that the company had some pent-up demand from customers who had placed their orders before lockdown. But she said it could take some time for demand to recover to its level before the pandemic: ""In reality, with all the variables going on in the economic environment, we do not expect to see [demand] come back until Q4, Q1 of next year. We have to be realistic about the variables and what is happening out there in the economy,"" she said.The company has spoken to the government about introducing new incentives for car buying, with the cost equally shared between the industry and government, Ms Jones said. The incentives would be linked to purchases of lower-emitting vehicles, including battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on iPlayer.

The robot assistant that can guess what you want,"Thomas Roszak was working as a maintenance technician at Ocado's giant warehouse in Hatfield when he received a very unusual assignment.His regular job involved repairing and maintaining the online supermarket's automated sorting and packing system, which puts together grocery orders from customers.It can be physically demanding work, manipulating heavy panels and working with other pieces of bulky machinery.In a project designed to ease that burden, Ocado Technology, had been developing a robot that can recognise when a technician might need help and step in with either the right tool or help with lifting.Mr Roszak was asked to help test the machine and when he saw it for the first time, was taken back to his childhood,""I grew up on movies like The Terminator, so when I saw that robot I was actually impressed with what it looked like. You can actually imagine it looks like a man.""For Mr Roszak, the robot's strength was a real asset. One test job involved removing a heavy metal plate from above head height.A human would struggle to hold the plate for more than two or three minutes, but the robot found it ""easy"" to hold the plate in place, while Mr Roszak undid the bolts. Mr Roszak's experience was early on in the project, called SecondHands, which involved Ocado and researchers at four European universities and funded by the European Union.The goal was to build a collaborative robot, or cobot, based on the ARMAR-6 robot, developed at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.The project ended on 4 May and, while the robot is still a long way from becoming a regular feature in workplaces, the researchers feel they have made important progress, by bringing together robot arms and hands, vision systems, voice recognition and knitting it all together with an artificial intelligence (AI).It was an ambitious project, says Graham Deacon, robotics research fellow at Ocado Technology, because they didn't want a robot that would just respond to commands, they wanted the machine to actually anticipate what the technician needed.""The key point about the whole thing was that we will have a robot system that could kind of watch what the maintenance technicians were doing, understand what activity they were engaged in, and then proactively offer the appropriate assistance at the right point in time,"" he says.So the robot's AI was trained by watching humans perform tasks.""I would say 80% of the skills of the robot were really learned from human demonstration,"" says Prof Tamim Asfour from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).That was important as it is much faster to train AI that way than to programme instructions from scratch, says Prof Asfour.The team also wanted the robot to recognise speech and respond in a natural way.""The breakthroughs made in areas like natural language interfaces and task understanding will lead to better acceptance of cobots by humans, and allow them to be used in a more easy, natural way,"" says Sebastian Stüker, from KIT.To be useful robots have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous to humans. Most industrial robot arms have to operate behind cages, because they would skittle any human that strayed into their path.To ensure their machine could work side-by-side with a human, the SecondHands robot has a sophisticated vision system, with five cameras which track the movements of its human co-worker and identify objects, such as tools.It has also been trained to recognise when to use appropriate force. ""One of the requirements in the design to build the arms... is they actually recognise collisions with the body of humans and stop immediately,"" says Prof Asfour.More Technology of BusinessProf Nathan Lepora is head of the tactile robotics group at Bristol Robotics Laboratory (who were not involved in the SecondHands project), and he agrees this has been an ambitious project.""This is enormously challenging. You are trying to reproduce capabilities that only humans currently possess: to work alongside other humans. It required expertise in building humanoid robots, online learning where the robot teaches itself to do tasks, and sophisticated computer vision to navigate and interact with the environment,"" he says.Prof Lepora says the SecondHands project reminds him of the PR2 robot made and sold by Willow Garage a decade ago. ""However, the ARMAR-6 benefits from much more dexterous hands, and also there have been huge advances in AI over the last decade, particularly in computer vision, which are now extending into robot learning - robots learning from instructors or by themselves how to do tasks and jobs.""Asimo, made by Japanese industrial giant Honda, is perhaps the world's best known robot. It can run and climb stairs. The eventual goal is for it to help people in the home, but Honda admits it is still not ready to do that.But with its ability to anticipate and communicate, the ARMAR-6 robot is potentially much more useful.""Asimo is able to respond to its name and recognises sounds associated with a falling object or collision, but ARMAR-6 can understand much more and even ask qualifying questions like 'which tool do you need?'"" says Graham Deacon from Ocado Technology.""The ARMAR-6's cognitive and speech capabilities make it much more interactive, and in a natural way - a prerequisite for a truly interactive and co-operative cobot,"" he adds.So what happens next, now the five-year project is over? At the moment the ARMAR-6 has only been tested on a small set of tasks. Much more work has to be done to extend its range, and beyond that it would need certification to prove it could work safely alongside humans.Mr Deacon declines to speculate as to when that might be, but is hopeful it will happen,""The results of this project have shown categorically how robots can amplify the benefits of human expertise. We'll continue to build on these learnings, looking forward to a future where we can use these breakthroughs to apply them to a real world setting.""",12 May 2020,business
The high-flying circus firm for pop and rock stars,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Billy Alwen and Julian Bracey, founders of UK circus performance business Cirque Bijou.Many of us dream of quitting our nine-to-five jobs, to, as the saying goes, ""run away and join the circus"". Billy Alwen did just that - literally - when he quit a fledgling career in politics in 1992, aged 25, to become a full-time circus performer. A few years later, in 1999, he set up Bristol-based Cirque Bijou with his friend Julian Bracey.Over the past two decades their business has designed and performed large open-air spectacles at cultural events around the world, from Glastonbury Festival, to Olympic Games, to New Year celebrations in the Far East.At the same time, its staff go on tour with singers and bands such as Taylor Swift, Katy Perry and Muse, to bring their performances alive with fire performers, tight-rope walkers, and even giant robots.Londoner Billy had been all set for a life in politics. After getting a degree in international relations from Staffordshire University, he spent three years working as a political researcher in the House of Commons.But in his spare time he had started training as a trapeze artist, and in 1992 he walked away from the day job to become a full-time professional circus performer.""I knew my heart lay in performing,"" says Billy, now 53.He started to get work with circuses, and performed at private parties and festivals.Meanwhile, Julian Bracey, who is from Bristol, studied design at university in the 1990s. He had won a scholarship to enrol on a prestigious course at the University of Montreal.On the streets of the Canadian city he says he was exposed to a lot of circus and street performance.""I would see people busking in a market, and think, 'I can do that,'"" says Julian, 50. So he ditched his plans for a career in design.""I ended up street performing all around the world, as a fire performer, acrobat, unicyclist and juggler.""Then I joined a French circus, working as a compere. I wasn't fluent in any other languages, but I learnt the whole show in French, and even Spanish.""Returning to the UK, Julian joined a Bristol-based circus group, where Billy was by then working.When they decided to go into business together they had no money to invest other than what they were continuing to earn from ad-hoc performance work.To keep costs down they made do with a couple of computers, and based themselves in Julian's father's basement.Billy says they decided to stay in Bristol because ""it has a thriving arts scene, and is a renowned centre for circus in the UK"".But why the French name, which translates as ""Elegant Circus""? Julian explains: ""At the time, being an English circus wasn't that cool, so we thought we should give ourselves a French name, hence Cirque Bijou.""The business then grew steadily over the years, thanks to word of mouth, and Julian's excellent contacts. ""I had a little black book, and I knew lots of people, as I had travelled a lot,"" he says.""I was quite protective of our contacts. That's changed now because of social media, it's now more inclusive. You can now see someone on TV, Google their name, and say, 'Hey, do you want to be in our show?'""More The Boss features:As the company grew, Billy and Julian both quickly gave up performing themselves, to instead focus on the production work.Over the years they have produced spectacles such as the annual Taiwan Lantern Festival, an international exhibition in Kazakhstan, and the opening ceremonies for the sailing events at the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in the UK.The show for the Paralympics involved 64 disabled and non-disabled performers. Billy was so inspired by the experience that he formed a side company called Extraordinary Bodies, where disabled and non-disabled artists can work equally together.""It's something I'm incredibly proud of."" he says. ""Also, if you change who you see on stage it changes who the audience are.""When you add Cirque Bijou's work with music artists, and the company is typically involved in more than 100 shows around the world each year. To meet all its commitments, the business relies on a pool of about 200 freelance performers.Given that these men and women are often playing with fire, or walking tightropes, health and safety is a big factor.One year they worked with Katy Perry at an awards show, where she wanted Catherine wheels attached to the backpacks of all her dancers.""We strapped the fireworks to their backs, and we'd accounted for all the health and safety hazards,"" says Julian. ""But then this guy from Sony came up to us, and said, 'You realise that there's this invisible video screen behind you? It's worth £300,000, and if you burn it you are in trouble!'""That was slightly scary, but in over 20 years we have never had any accidents, which is amazing.""Typically, Billy and Julian spend lots of time travelling around the world for work, which both admit can take a toll on their personal lives. Julian says it was particularly tough when he spent five months on tour with Muse when his daughter was born. Presently though, all is on hold due to the coronavirus lockdown.""We have had around 20 events cancelled or postponed,"" says Julian. ""The summer season for live events is effectively cancelled.""The company is using the downtime to develop new shows instead.Ade Berry, artistic director at London arts and cultural venue Jacksons Lane, says Cirque Bijou has ""paved the way"" for circus performance in the UK.""It's redefining circus, and pushing organisations like us to try to achieve more, and rethink everything we know,"" says Mr Berry. He adds that Cirque Bijou's continuing work with disabled people via Extraordinary Bodies is particularly inspiring.As to the future of Cirque Bijou, Billy and Julian see it carrying on for at least another 20 years. It does sound more fun than a typical nine-to-five job.",11 May 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Fed warns of slow recovery without more virus relief,"Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has warned that America faces a slow and painful economic recovery without additional government relief.The dark forecast from the head of the US central bank is a turnaround from early April, when he said he expected a robust rebound.It comes as lawmakers debate additional spending to shield the US economy from coronavirus shutdowns.Mr Powell said further measures would be ""costly but worth it"".Employers in the US cut more than 20 million jobs last month, sending the unemployment rate to 14.7%, with the many of the losses falling on poor and minority households. Analysts expect the jobless rate to climb further in May, before starting to subside.Mr Powell said on Wednesday that unemployment levels are likely to to remain elevated - particularly compared to the 50-year lows the US labour market enjoyed as recently as February. ""There is a growing sense...that the recovery will come more slowly than we would like, but it will come and that may mean that it is necessary for us to do more,"" he said in a video conference hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Financial markets sank following the comments, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending more than 2% lower.The US has already approved nearly $3tn (£2.5tn) in new spending - packages worth an estimated 14% of the country's economy. The Fed has also taken radical steps to shore up the economy, pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system.While Democrats this week proposed an additional $3tn package, Mitch McConnell, who leads the Republicans in the Senate, responded that there was ""no urgency"" to act.Some in Washington are leery of further spending, pointing to America's skyrocketing national debt.But Mr Powell said now was not the time for those worries.""We know that long periods of unemployment leave a shadow...we also know that waves of bankruptcies can weigh on economic activity for years,"" he stressed. ""Now, when we are facing the biggest shock that the economy has had in modern times, is for me, not the time to prioritise considerations like that.""I do think that we can come back to them fairly quickly, which is to say a few years down the road when the economy is well and truly recovered, or at least recovering.""While the Fed casts itself as politically neutral, Mr Powell has spent much of his tenure as chair of the bank facing political battles. Prior to the pandemic, he was a repeated target of criticism by President Donald Trump, who wanted the Fed to do more to help the economy.At a press conference on Wednesday, however, Mr Trump described Mr Powell as an ""MIP"".""You know what an MIP is? Most improved player,"" he said.",14 May 2020,business
New York City caps fees for food delivery apps,"New York City has placed limits on how much food delivery apps can charge restaurants that use their platforms.The proposal, which was put to a vote on Wednesday, will cap fees at 20% and apply in emergency situations when restaurants must be shut.There have been complaints about fees charged by tech firms amid skyrocketing deliveries during the lockdown.Other US cities such as San Francisco, Washington and Seattle have also introduced tighter rules for the apps.Grubhub, the owner of online food ordering service Seamless and the biggest player in the US market, warned that the city's cap would raise costs for customers and reduce opportunities for workers. The firm said the law was ""an overstep"" by local officials and would not withstand legal challenge.""Any arbitrary cap - regardless of the duration - will lower order volume to locally-owned restaurants, increase costs for small business owners and raise costs on consumers,"" said Grubhub.""Delivery workers would have fewer work opportunities and lower earnings.""The New York City Council had started discussing ways to limit the fees charged by mobile apps before the pandemic hit.But the crisis for restaurants triggered by shutdown orders injected new urgency into the effort, as many restaurants found themselves reliant on food delivery apps such as Grubhub, Doordash and UberEats, for business.The firms currently charge restaurants a range that can exceed 30% per order, with fees for services including marketing, taking customer orders and fulfilling delivery. These fees can be punishing in an industry where the profit margins typically hover around 10%.George Constantinou, who runs restaurants in New York and New Jersey, told the BBC in April that he was trying to negotiate lower rates for his business, describing the commissions as unsustainable.""When you have a full dining room and you're already paying for your cooks and your staff to be there it's one thing, but when you don't have that dining room, it hurts you,"" he said.Last month, three restaurants filed a class-action lawsuit in New York, accusing Grubhub, Doordash, Postmates and Uber Eats of exerting monopoly power that led to exorbitant fees and restrictions on restaurants.Reports this week that Uber and Grubhub are planning to merge have only heightened those concerns. While delivery apps have announced their own relief to restaurants since the pandemic, taking steps to waive, reduce or defer some some of the charges, restaurant owners and their advocates say the firms have not gone far enough.On Tuesday, ahead of the vote, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he supported plans to cap the fees, calling it ""smart legislation"". City Councilman Mark Gjonaj, a sponsor of the legislation, said he hoped the limits would provide relief.""Proud to fight for a bill that will level the playing field and help restaurants get through this crisis, as restaurant owners are being held hostage by the third party delivery apps who monopolize search results,"" he wrote on Twitter.Content is not availableAndrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance called the measure a ""critical first step"".""We look forward to working with lawmakers to enact these protections on a permanent basis,"" he said.",13 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Moving home allowed as curbs lift on estate agents in England,"The government has set out plans to restart England's housing market, which has been in deep freeze since the coronavirus lockdown.Estate agents can now open, viewings can be carried out and removal firms and conveyancers can restart operations.Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said the changes must be carried out under social distancing and safety rules.It is estimated there are 450,000 buyers and renters with plans on hold.""Our clear plan will enable people to move home safely, covering each aspect of the sales and letting process, from viewings to removals,"" Mr Jenrick said.""This critical industry can now safely move forward, and those waiting patiently to move can now do so."" Meanwhile, the property markets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland remain shut. Home viewings are not permitted under lockdown regulations and their land registries are either running a reduced service or are not registering transactions. Alistair Elliott, chairman and senior partner at estate agents Knight Frank, told the BBC's Today programme the measures were ""a major first step"".""We believe the public will have confidence to re-engage with the housing market,"" he said.Jonathan Hopper, chief executive of real estate consultants Garrington Property Finders, said: ""Few things are more likely to make people want to move than being cooped up in the same four walls for weeks on end, and property portals have seen traffic increase by up to a fifth.""This announcement by the government will test the housing sector's hope, and belief, that a wave of pent-up demand amongst buyers and renters is ready to be released. Yet, the reality is that many people's finances are now less secure than they were just a few months ago when they were preparing to move. Expect a lot more haggling over price from both sides if they have yet to have formally agreed what they will pay or accept, especially if getting a mortgage is harder. Estate agent Savills has already suggested that people who still have money to look for somewhere new, may now be rethinking their priorities. A spare room and good Wi-Fi may suddenly have become more appealing when working from home, and a large garden may be even more of a golden ticket for anyone with children. Housing Secretary Mr Jenrick said guidance from Public Health England must continue to be followed. For example, anyone advised to self-isolate should continue to do so and not move home.  The move has raised questions over how social distancing would work during the viewing process to ensure people remain safe, particularly when tenants are still at home. Miles Shipside, from property portal Rightmove, said he expected digital viewings to remain popular.Property website Zoopla previously estimated that about 373,000 property sales had been put on hold during lockdown - with a total value of £82bn.Agreed sales were running at a 10th of the normal level for the time of year, and were akin to the activity seen in late December, it said.Spring is usually a busy time for the housing and mortgage markets.Buyers deserted the housing market for obvious reasons just before and after the introduction of virus restrictions, which began on 23 March.Content available only in the UKThis led to a 70% drop in buyer demand over the course of a few weeks. Meanwhile, rental demand is 42% down since the start of March, according to Zoopla.The government has also outlined other measures to get the house building sector moving, including: The new guidance includes the permission for trades people to operate in homes, providing they follow social distancing advice.Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation, said:  ""A resumption of work will play a major part in helping the economy recover, as well as delivering the homes the country needs.  ""It should also provide the supply chain with the confidence it needs to accelerate its own restart.""",13 May 2020,business
