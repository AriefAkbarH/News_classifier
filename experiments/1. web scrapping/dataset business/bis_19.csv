Nissan: UK factory still under threat from no-deal Brexit,"The UK's largest car manufacturing plant is ""unsustainable"" if the UK leaves the European Union without a trade deal, owner Nissan says.The Japanese company's global chief operating head told the BBC people had to understand the EU was the Sunderland factory's biggest customer.Ashwani Gupta said that Nissan's commitment could not be maintained if there was not tariff-free EU access.Nissan has invested billions of pounds in the plant, which has 7,000 workers.His comments come despite the Sunderland site surviving this week's announcement on the Japanese giant's global restructuring programme.  Mr Gupta said: ""You know we are the number one carmaker in the UK and we want to continue. We are committed. Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it's not our intention but the business will not be sustainable. That's what everybody has to understand.""He also said that any plans for its strategic partner and 43%-shareholder Renault to take up spare capacity at Sunderland would be a matter for the French carmaker. The French government has a 15% stake in Renault.This is not the first time that Nissan has pleaded with UK and EU negotiators to ensure that the 70% of cars manufactured at Sunderland which are sold in the EU can avoid tariffs of 10% under World Trade Organisation rules - the legal default position if a deal is not struck.Those talks resumed this week, with the differences between the UK and EU being described on all sides as deep and wide.Last week, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU would consider a two-year Brexit delay, which was rebuffed by his UK counterpart David Frost, who told MPs the government's policy remains not to extend the transition period beyond the end of the year.Under an agreement signed last year, the UK has until the end of this month to decide whether it wants to request such an extension so the coming weeks are crucial.The comments by Nissan may dampen hopes raised just last week when the company said that while it was closing plants in Spain and Indonesia, it remained committed to Sunderland.An announcement by Nissan that Renault might take the European lead in the companies' global manufacturing alliance (which also includes Mitsubishi) by taking up an estimated 20% spare capacity at Sunderland were quashed for the foreseeable future by Renault last week, when it said it had no current plans to move in to the UK.Mr Gupta confirmed that any decision by its partners would be a matter for them, and that no such deal had been agreed. ""When it comes to the allocation of manufacturing, each company will take the decision based on the competitiveness of the plants.""Nissan is a huge fan of the Sunderland plant and paid tribute to the efficiency and hard work of the operation. But it reiterated that was not enough to secure its long-term future if tariffs were imposed in a market which it described last week as ""non-core"". It only has a 3% market share of the vehicle market in Europe.On a more encouraging note, Mr Gupta said recent sales figures from China showed the world's biggest car market was recovering fast and the company was winning market share. But vehicles for that market are not produced in the UK. It is still possible that Renault could decide to move production of certain vehicles to Sunderland. But it is hard to see how a company which is 15%-owned by the French taxpayer could find a way to make that work where Nissan, which has been in Sunderland for 40 years, says it cannot.Nissan's comments are a timely reminder that for many key industries, the Brexit issue - which has not been silenced by coronavirus news - has in many ways been amplified by it.

"Renault cuts 15,000 jobs in major restructuring","Renault is cutting 15,000 jobs worldwide as part of a €2bn (£1.8bn) cost-cutting plan after seeing sales plunge because of the virus pandemic.""This plan is essential,"" said interim boss Clotilde Delbos, who announced a bigger focus on electric cars and vans.Some 4,600 jobs will go in France, and Renault has said six plants are under review for possible cuts and closure.Renault played down reports it could move some production to the UK plant run by its strategic partner Nissan.""You shouldn't believe everything you read in the newspapers,"" Ms Delbos said. ""All you've seen in the newspapers are but rumours.""On Thursday, Nissan unveiled huge job cuts and the closure of its factory in Barcelona. The UK plant, in Sunderland, would remain open, the Japanese company said.Renault, 15% owned by the French state and which is in talks with the government about an €8bn loan, has begun negotiations with unions about which factories could shut.The company is slashing costs by cutting the number of subcontractors in areas such as engineering, reducing the number of components it uses, freezing expansion plans in Romania and Morocco and shrinking gearbox manufacturing worldwide.The French firm plans to trim its global production capacity to 3.3 million vehicles in 2024 from 4 million now, focusing on areas like small vans or electric cars.Renault is part of a three-way alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi. On Thursday, Nissan said it would close its factory in Barcelona with the loss of about 2,800 jobs in a bid to cut costs, prompting protests at the Spanish plant.Cost-cutting measures announced by both Renault and Nissan mark a departure from the ambitious expansion plan devised by now-ousted leader of the alliance, Carlos Ghosn.Renault's interim chief executive Ms Delbos said during a press conference on Friday: ""We have to change our mindset.""We're not looking to be on top of the world, what we want is a sustainable and profitable company.""Renault, which claims more than 4% of the global car market, said its plans would affect about 10% of its 179,000-strong global workforce and cost up to €1.2bn (£1.1bn).Ms Delbos added that Renault would review each region in order to decide where job cuts will fall. ""This will help us come back to our ideal size,"" she said.Both Nissan and Renault were already facing falling sales before the Covid-19 outbreak worsened trading.

Former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn had targeted 5 million car sales by 2022. Today's restructuring sees the company cut maximum production capacity to 3.3 million vehicles by 2024. The news does more than rip up Renault's previous strategy. It reveals more of the shape of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. While they will co-operate on cutting costs, each company will take the lead on certain new-car developments. And there's a geographical split: Renault focusing on Europe and Russia, Nissan on China, Japan and the US, and Mitsubishi on South East Asia.

Coronavirus: UK holidaymakers ‘welcome’ in Portugal,"Portugal's foreign minister has said anyone in the UK thinking of going to Portugal this summer will be ""most welcome"" amid coronavirus.Augusto Santos Silva said he hoped an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June.The UK is set to give more details of its plan to force arrivals into quarantine for 14 days later. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel will say air bridges to countries with low virus infection rates are possible in future. This would mean that people arriving from certain places will not have to self-isolate. However, that will only apply to countries with low Covid-19 infection rates, she is expected to tell MPs. She will also say that the planned quarantine for arrivals is necessary ""to prevent a second wave of the virus"".Meanwhile, Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye has told BBC Breakfast that travellers will have to fill out details of where they will be staying to quarantine, when they book their flight.He said there will then be ""spot checks"" within the immigration area, where the Border Force officers will check if people have filled out their form. ""All of the form-filling will take place before you get on a plane, and will be done online. The government will be able to check information before people get onto a plane,"" he said. Some countries have already started to ease travel restrictions.  The German foreign minister Heiko Maas said the country would lift a travel ban for EU countries, as well as the UK and a handful of others - as long as they do not have large-scale lockdowns in place.However, Germany will advise against travel to Britain for as long as the UK government demands a 14-day quarantine for new arrivals.Portugal's Mr Santos Silva told the BBC that an agreement between the UK and Portugal could be in place by the end of June, meaning that holidaymakers returning to the UK from Portugal would escape the quarantine rules. He said any travel quarantine ""was an enemy of tourism"", but that he respected the UK government's decision to enforce one on almost all arrivals to the UK from next Monday. Mr Santos Silva said ""rules"" would ensure that people would be able to holiday safely. The minister suggested that nightlife in Portuguese resorts this summer would be very limited and people would not be allowed to congregate in groups at night. He said hotels and apartments which comply with standards set by the tourism board would be labelled as ""clean and safe"".Portugal's foreign minister confirmed talks on the matter were continuing with the UK. But he insisted that Portugal would not impose any type of quarantine for people arriving in his country.Instead, he said Portugal would rely on temperature checks at airports and that Portugal was, in coordination with other EU countries, considering carrying out ""random testing"" on passengers.Mr Santos Silva said tourists would be warned how full beaches are, so that they could avoid crowded spots. UK aviation bosses hope that a large number of air bridge agreements will be in place by 29 June, when the travel quarantine is set to be reviewed. More tourists from the UK head to the Algarve each summer than from any other country. But Spain, another country whose tourism sector relies heavily on British holidaymakers, is taking a different approach. The Spanish government has said it will only allow UK tourists in this summer if the infection rate in the UK falls more significantly. The UK travel quarantine will apply to people arriving from any country, apart from the Republic of Ireland, and will also apply to UK nationals. People will be required to self-isolate in a private residence for two weeks. The government says people ""could be contacted regularly during this period to ensure compliance"".People who break the rules could be fined £1,000. UK travel companies say the travel quarantine already means people are not booking holidays. They warn that more businesses in the sector now face financial ruin. The measure will be reviewed every three weeks.When deciding whether to keep the quarantine in place, the government will consider several factors. They include:A growing list of Conservative MPs have spoken out against the blanket travel quarantine. However, a YouGov poll of 1,565 adults in Great Britain suggests that there is public support. 63% of those surveyed thought people should be quarantined as per the government's plan. About one quarter thought that the quarantine should only apply to people arriving from countries with a ""high number of coronavirus cases"". Only 4% thought that there should be no quarantine at all. Labour has questioned why a travel quarantine was not introduced some weeks ago. New figures show that between the beginning of January and the end of April, 14,225 flights arrived into UK airports. Are you planning to go on holiday this year?

Google in $5bn lawsuit for tracking in 'private' mode,"Google has been sued in the US over claims it illegally invades the privacy of users by tracking people even when they are browsing in ""private mode"".The class action wants at least $5bn (£4bn) from Google and owner Alphabet.Many internet users assume their search history isn't being tracked when they view in private mode, but Google says this isn't the case.The search engine denies this is illegal and says it is upfront about the data it collects in this mode.The proposed class action likely includes ""millions"" of Google users who since 1 June 2016 browsed the internet in private mode according to law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who filed the claim on Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, California.Incognito mode within Google's Chrome browser gives users the choice to search the internet without their activity being saved to the browser or device. But the websites visited can use tools such as Google Analytics to track usage.The complaint says that Google ""cannot continue to engage in the covert and unauthorized data collection from virtually every American with a computer or phone"".Vigorously denying the claims Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: ""As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity"".The search engine says the collection of search history, even in private viewing mode, helps site owners ""better evaluate the performance of their content, products, marketing and more.""While private browsing has been available from Google for some time, Boies Schiller Flexner said it recently decided to represent three plaintiffs based in the US. ""People everywhere are becoming more aware (and concerned) that their personal communications are being intercepted, collected, recorded, or exploited for gain by technology companies they have come to depend on,"" it said in the filing.

Coronavirus: Australia set for first recession in three decades,"Australia is set for its first recession in 29 years as the country feels the impact of the virus pandemic.Official figures show that the economy shrank by 0.3% in the first three months of the year, amid bushfires and the early stages of the outbreak.Economists expect data for the current quarter to confirm that the shutdowns have pushed the country into recession.It comes even after the government and central bank stepped up measures to support the economy.The latest gross domestic product (GDP) figures highlight that the economy was struggling from a devastating bushfire season, a slowdown in tourism and weak domestic demand even before the virus-related restrictions started. ""This was the slowest through-the-year growth since September 2009, when Australia was in the midst of the global financial crisis, and captures just the beginning of the expected economic effects of Covid-19,"" Bureau of Statistics chief economist Bruce Hockman said.In March the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its main interest rate to a record low of 0.25%. The central bank also launched an unlimited bond buying programme.While the central bank kept the cost of borrowing on hold at its meeting on Tuesday, Governor Philip Lowe said the country was facing the toughest conditions since the Great Depression.""The Australian economy is going through a very difficult period and is experiencing the biggest economic contraction since the 1930s.""However, he did add a note of optimism to his outlook: ""It is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected.""""The rate of new infections has declined significantly and some restrictions have been eased earlier than was previously thought likely,"" he said.The Australian government has also pledged hundreds of billions dollars to help support businesses and individuals and has signalled that more stimulus measures would be announced soon.Last month Japan fell into recession for the first time since 2015 as the world's third biggest economy shrank at an annual pace of 3.4% in the first three months of the year.The week before Germany, Europe's largest economy, slipped into recession, while other big economies, including the UK and the US are also seeing sharp downturns.A recession is widely defined as two  quarters in a row of economic contraction, or shrinking GDP.",3 June 2020,business
Zoom sees sales boom amid pandemic,"When it comes to its growth rate, video conference company Zoom has lived up to its name.Use of the firm's software jumped 30-fold in April, as the coronavirus pandemic forced millions to work, learn and socialise remotely.At its peak, the firm counted more than 300 million daily participants in virtual meetings, while paying customers have more than tripled.The dramatic uptake has the potential to change the firm's path.Zoom said it expects sales as high as $1.8bn (£1.4bn) this year - roughly double what it forecast in March.""It's a huge opportunity,"" chief executive Eric Yuan told investors on Tuesday.Mr Yuan didn't intend to create Zoom for the masses.A Chinese-born software engineer, Mr Yuan started the company in 2011, after years rising through the ranks at WebEx, one of the first US video conference companies, which was purchased by Cisco in 2007 for $3.2bn.At the time, he faced doubts from many investors, who did not see the need for another option in a market already dominated by big players such as Microsoft and Cisco.But Mr Yuan - who has credited his interest in video conferencing to the long distances he had to travel to meet up with his now-wife in their youth - was frustrated at Cisco and believed there was demand in the business world for software that would work on mobile phones and be easier to use.When the firm sold its first shares to the public last year, it was valued at $15.9bn. That shot to more than $58bn on Tuesday.""What Zoom has done is kind of democratised video conferencing for all kinds of businesses and made it very simple for everyone from yoga instructors through to board room executives to deploy video,"" says Alex Smith, senior director at Canalys.When the lockdowns started, Zoom lifted the limits for the free version of its software in China and for educators in many countries, including the UK, helping to drive its popularity.But the firm's bread and butter customers are corporate clients, who pay for subscriptions and enhanced features.Zoom said on Tuesday that sales jumped 169% year-on-year in the three months to 30 April to $328.2m, as it added more than 180,000 customers with more than 10 employees since January - far more than it had expected.It also turned a profit of $27m in the quarter - more than it made in all of the prior financial year.The massive uptake has also strained the firm, forcing it to invest to expand capacity to meet the needs of new users, many of whom are not paying customers.Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees.It has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use. In April, Mr Yuan, who is a US citizen, apologised for the security lapses and the firm started rolling out a number of changes intended to fix the problems. Zoom has also announced a number of new appointments familiar with Washington politics, including H R McMaster, a retired Army general and former national security adviser to Donald Trump. ""Navigating this process has been a humbling learning experience,"" Mr Yuan said on an investor call on Tuesday.Analysts said they expected the company would overcome these reputational blows.""It's had that mishap and the fact that its name is still very much used as verbatim with video technology still gives it a lot of momentum and opportunity to continue,"" Mr Smith said.Analysts say they expect Zoom to maintain its focus on business customers, since that's how it makes money.But the pandemic is likely to create more challenges for Zoom in that market, as increased demand for remote work prompts competitors such as Microsoft and Cisco to pour resources into the field.""The stakes are higher and the competition's getting tougher, so we'll see,"" says Ryan Koontz, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities.""They were on a very strong trajectory before... and happened to be in the right place at the right time as the whole world decided we needed to communicate well on video,"" he says. ""They have this amazing brand... now they have to leverage that brand and figure out which markets they're going to go after.""",2 June 2020,business
US challenges 'unfair' tech taxes in the UK and EU,"The US has launched a formal investigation into new digital taxes over concerns they ""unfairly target"" American tech giants like Facebook.The inquiry will examine tax schemes in 10 jurisdictions including the UK, European Union and India.It is the first step in a process that could lead to the introduction of tariffs, or other trade retaliation.The Treasury defended the UK levy, saying it did not violate ""international obligations"".""Our Digital Services Tax ensures that digital businesses pay tax in the UK that reflects the value they derive from UK users, and is compatible with the UK's international obligations,"" a spokesperson said.The probe comes as a rising number of countries consider new taxes on online services, arguing that firms pay too little under current law and should be taxed based on where sales or activity takes place, rather than where they are headquartered.The US, home to many big tech companies such as Google and Amazon, has said the issue should be addressed in a multilateral agreement via the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But those discussions have been slow-going, prompting many countries to forge ahead on their own. In the UK, a 2% tax on digital sales came into force in April. Lawmakers in Spain are expected to take up the matter this week.""President Trump is concerned that many of our trading partners are adopting tax schemes designed to unfairly target our companies,"" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement. ""We are prepared to take all appropriate action to defend our businesses and workers against any such discrimination.""Officials have said in the past that the administration would consider taxes on foreign cars as retaliation.Last year, after France moved forward with a 3% tax on sales, the US threatened tariffs on $2.4bn (£1.9bn) worth of French goods, including cheese and champagne, after a similar investigation declared the new levy ""discriminatory"".The US dropped the threat this winter after France agreed to delay collection until the end of 2020. The Treasury added that the UK has said it would remove its services tax in the event of a broader deal. ""We have always been clear that our preference is for a global solution to the tax challenges posed by digitalisation and we'll continue to work with the US and other international partners to achieve that objective,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.The probe announced on Tuesday concerns taxes that have gone into effect, or are being planned, in Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, European Union, Indonesia, India, Italy, Turkey, Spain, and the UK.The US has requested comments on the matter, which must be submitted by 15 July.",2 June 2020,business
Nissan: UK factory still under threat from no-deal Brexit,"The UK's largest car manufacturing plant is ""unsustainable"" if the UK leaves the European Union without a trade deal, owner Nissan says.The Japanese company's global chief operating head told the BBC people had to understand the EU was the Sunderland factory's biggest customer.Ashwani Gupta said that Nissan's commitment could not be maintained if there was not tariff-free EU access.Nissan has invested billions of pounds in the plant, which has 7,000 workers.His comments come despite the Sunderland site surviving this week's announcement on the Japanese giant's global restructuring programme.  Mr Gupta said: ""You know we are the number one carmaker in the UK and we want to continue. We are committed. Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it's not our intention but the business will not be sustainable. That's what everybody has to understand.""He also said that any plans for its strategic partner and 43%-shareholder Renault to take up spare capacity at Sunderland would be a matter for the French carmaker. The French government has a 15% stake in Renault.This is not the first time that Nissan has pleaded with UK and EU negotiators to ensure that the 70% of cars manufactured at Sunderland which are sold in the EU can avoid tariffs of 10% under World Trade Organisation rules - the legal default position if a deal is not struck.Those talks resumed this week, with the differences between the UK and EU being described on all sides as deep and wide.Last week, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU would consider a two-year Brexit delay, which was rebuffed by his UK counterpart David Frost, who told MPs the government's policy remains not to extend the transition period beyond the end of the year.Under an agreement signed last year, the UK has until the end of this month to decide whether it wants to request such an extension so the coming weeks are crucial.The comments by Nissan may dampen hopes raised just last week when the company said that while it was closing plants in Spain and Indonesia, it remained committed to Sunderland.An announcement by Nissan that Renault might take the European lead in the companies' global manufacturing alliance (which also includes Mitsubishi) by taking up an estimated 20% spare capacity at Sunderland were quashed for the foreseeable future by Renault last week, when it said it had no current plans to move in to the UK.Mr Gupta confirmed that any decision by its partners would be a matter for them, and that no such deal had been agreed. ""When it comes to the allocation of manufacturing, each company will take the decision based on the competitiveness of the plants.""Nissan is a huge fan of the Sunderland plant and paid tribute to the efficiency and hard work of the operation. But it reiterated that was not enough to secure its long-term future if tariffs were imposed in a market which it described last week as ""non-core"". It only has a 3% market share of the vehicle market in Europe.On a more encouraging note, Mr Gupta said recent sales figures from China showed the world's biggest car market was recovering fast and the company was winning market share. But vehicles for that market are not produced in the UK. It is still possible that Renault could decide to move production of certain vehicles to Sunderland. But it is hard to see how a company which is 15%-owned by the French taxpayer could find a way to make that work where Nissan, which has been in Sunderland for 40 years, says it cannot.Nissan's comments are a timely reminder that for many key industries, the Brexit issue - which has not been silenced by coronavirus news - has in many ways been amplified by it.

The UK plant, in Sunderland, would remain open, the Japanese company said.Renault, 15% owned by the French state and which is in talks with the government about an €8bn loan, has begun negotiations with unions about which factories could shut.The company is slashing costs by cutting the number of subcontractors in areas such as engineering, reducing the number of components it uses, freezing expansion plans in Romania and Morocco and shrinking gearbox manufacturing worldwide.The French firm plans to trim its global production capacity to 3.3 million vehicles in 2024 from 4 million now, focusing on areas like small vans or electric cars.Renault is part of a three-way alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi. On Thursday, Nissan said it would close its factory in Barcelona with the loss of about 2,800 jobs in a bid to cut costs, prompting protests at the Spanish plant.Cost-cutting measures announced by both Renault and Nissan mark a departure from the ambitious expansion plan devised by now-ousted leader of the alliance, Carlos Ghosn.Renault's interim chief executive Ms Delbos said during a press conference on Friday: ""We have to change our mindset.""We're not looking to be on top of the world, what we want is a sustainable and profitable company.""Renault, which claims more than 4% of the global car market, said its plans would affect about 10% of its 179,000-strong global workforce and cost up to €1.2bn (£1.1bn).Ms Delbos added that Renault would review each region in order to decide where job cuts will fall.

The news does more than rip up Renault's previous strategy. It reveals more of the shape of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. While they will co-operate on cutting costs, each company will take the lead on certain new-car developments. And there's a geographical split: Renault focusing on Europe and Russia, Nissan on China, Japan and the US, and Mitsubishi on South East Asia.

She will also say that the planned quarantine for arrivals is necessary ""to prevent a second wave of the virus"".Meanwhile, Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye has told BBC Breakfast that travellers will have to fill out details of where they will be staying to quarantine, when they book their flight.He said there will then be ""spot checks"" within the immigration area, where the Border Force officers will check if people have filled out their form. ""All of the form-filling will take place before you get on a plane, and will be done online. The government will be able to check information before people get onto a plane,"" he said. Some countries have already started to ease travel restrictions.  The German foreign minister Heiko Maas said the country would lift a travel ban for EU countries, as well as the UK and a handful of others - as long as they do not have large-scale lockdowns in place.However, Germany will advise against travel to Britain for as long as the UK government demands a 14-day quarantine for new arrivals.Portugal's Mr Santos Silva told the BBC that an agreement between the UK and Portugal could be in place by the end of June, meaning that holidaymakers returning to the UK from Portugal would escape the quarantine rules. He said any travel quarantine ""was an enemy of tourism"", but that he respected the UK government's decision to enforce one on almost all arrivals to the UK from next Monday. Mr Santos Silva said ""rules"" would ensure that people would be able to holiday safely. The minister suggested that nightlife in Portuguese resorts this summer would be very limited and people would not be allowed to congregate in groups at night. He said hotels and apartments which comply with standards set by the tourism board would be labelled as ""clean and safe"".Portugal's foreign minister confirmed talks on the matter were continuing with the UK. But he insisted that Portugal would not impose any type of quarantine for people arriving in his country.Instead, he said Portugal would rely on temperature checks at airports and that Portugal was, in coordination with other EU countries, considering carrying out ""random testing"" on passengers.Mr Santos Silva said tourists would be warned how full beaches are, so that they could avoid crowded spots. UK aviation bosses hope that a large number of air bridge agreements will be in place by 29 June, when the travel quarantine is set to be reviewed. More tourists from the UK head to the Algarve each summer than from any other country. But Spain, another country whose tourism sector relies heavily on British holidaymakers, is taking a different approach. The Spanish government has said it will only allow UK tourists in this summer if the infection rate in the UK falls more significantly. The UK travel quarantine will apply to people arriving from any country, apart from the Republic of Ireland, and will also apply to UK nationals. People will be required to self-isolate in a private residence for two weeks. The government says people ""could be contacted regularly during this period to ensure compliance"".People who break the rules could be fined £1,000. UK travel companies say the travel quarantine already means people are not booking holidays. They warn that more businesses in the sector now face financial ruin. The measure will be reviewed every three weeks.When deciding whether to keep the quarantine in place, the government will consider several factors. They include:A growing list of Conservative MPs have spoken out against the blanket travel quarantine. However, a YouGov poll of 1,565 adults in Great Britain suggests that there is public support. 63% of those surveyed thought people should be quarantined as per the government's plan. About one quarter thought that the quarantine should only apply to people arriving from countries with a ""high number of coronavirus cases"". Only 4% thought that there should be no quarantine at all. Labour has questioned why a travel quarantine was not introduced some weeks ago.

Zoom sees sales boom amid pandemic,"When it comes to its growth rate, video conference company Zoom has lived up to its name.Use of the firm's software jumped 30-fold in April, as the coronavirus pandemic forced millions to work, learn and socialise remotely.At its peak, the firm counted more than 300 million daily participants in virtual meetings, while paying customers have more than tripled.The dramatic uptake has the potential to change the firm's path.Zoom said it expects sales as high as $1.8bn (£1.4bn) this year - roughly double what it forecast in March.""It's a huge opportunity,"" chief executive Eric Yuan told investors on Tuesday.Mr Yuan didn't intend to create Zoom for the masses.A Chinese-born software engineer, Mr Yuan started the company in 2011, after years rising through the ranks at WebEx, one of the first US video conference companies, which was purchased by Cisco in 2007 for $3.2bn.At the time, he faced doubts from many investors, who did not see the need for another option in a market already dominated by big players such as Microsoft and Cisco.But Mr Yuan - who has credited his interest in video conferencing to the long distances he had to travel to meet up with his now-wife in their youth - was frustrated at Cisco and believed there was demand in the business world for software that would work on mobile phones and be easier to use.When the firm sold its first shares to the public last year, it was valued at $15.9bn. That shot to more than $58bn on Tuesday.""What Zoom has done is kind of democratised video conferencing for all kinds of businesses and made it very simple for everyone from yoga instructors through to board room executives to deploy video,"" says Alex Smith, senior director at Canalys.When the lockdowns started, Zoom lifted the limits for the free version of its software in China and for educators in many countries, including the UK, helping to drive its popularity.But the firm's bread and butter customers are corporate clients, who pay for subscriptions and enhanced features.Zoom said on Tuesday that sales jumped 169% year-on-year in the three months to 30 April to $328.2m, as it added more than 180,000 customers with more than 10 employees since January - far more than it had expected.It also turned a profit of $27m in the quarter - more than it made in all of the prior financial year.The massive uptake has also strained the firm, forcing it to invest to expand capacity to meet the needs of new users, many of whom are not paying customers.Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees.It has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use. In April, Mr Yuan, who is a US citizen, apologised for the security lapses and the firm started rolling out a number of changes intended to fix the problems. Zoom has also announced a number of new appointments familiar with Washington politics, including H R McMaster, a retired Army general and former national security adviser to Donald Trump.

But those discussions have been slow-going, prompting many countries to forge ahead on their own. In the UK, a 2% tax on digital sales came into force in April. Lawmakers in Spain are expected to take up the matter this week.""President Trump is concerned that many of our trading partners are adopting tax schemes designed to unfairly target our companies,"" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement.

EasyJet hopes to reopen 75% of route network by August,"EasyJet says it hopes to resume flights on 75% of its route network by the end of August, although the number of daily services will still be significantly down for a normal summer season.The airline is already starting limited services this month, as it adjusts to the coronavirus collapse in air travel.Customers and cabin crew must wear face masks, and no food will be served.EasyJet is axing 4,500 jobs, and could be ejected from the FTSE 100 this week because its share price has tumbled.However, news of a slow return to services, along with what the airline claimed was its biggest ever summer promotion, helped to push EasyJet's share price 2.75% higher on Tuesday.EasyJet said half of its network would be reopened by the end of July, increasing to 75% during August.""Flights will be at a lower frequency than normal, meaning the airline will operate at around 30% of its normal capacity between July and September,"" the airline said.The carrier said services would operate from all its UK bases.EasyJet previously announced it would resume operations on 15 June, with flights mainly restricted to domestic routes in the UK and France.Rival Ryanair has operated a very limited schedule of flights during the pandemic, and has said it is planning to resume 40% of its ""normal flight schedules"" in July.EasyJet is introducing a series of safety measures, including requiring passengers to wear face masks at airports and on aircraft. It has produced thousands of face mask covers inspired by comic books to be handed to children flying on selected routes in an attempt to ease their anxiety about the new rule.Other steps to boost hygiene include not selling food during flights, enhanced cleaning of planes, and disinfection wipes and hand sanitiser being provided.Passengers will be invited to sit away from people not in their party on flights with empty seats.EasyJet's chief commercial and planning officer, Robert Carey, said: ""We are delighted to announce that we will be flying the majority of our route network across Europe, meaning customers can still get to their chosen destination for their summer holidays this year.""The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit sectors since the UK and other countries went into lockdown.

Coronavirus could ‘drag on US economy for a decade',"The drag on the US economy from the virus pandemic will last almost a decade, according to projections by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).It forecasts the outbreak will cut US economic output by 3% between this year and 2030, a loss of $7.9tn (£6.3tn).The warning comes as tens of millions of people are out of work due to lockdown measures.America's historic downturn comes even after trillions of dollars have been pumped into the economy.The nonpartisan CBO said the majority of the loss was caused by the sharp contraction in economic activity this year, which it had not predicted in its last 10-year report, published in January.“Business closures and social distancing measures are expected to curtail consumer spending, while the recent drop in energy prices is projected to severely reduce US investment in the energy sector,” CBO director Phillip Swagel wrote in response to an inquiry from Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.“Recent legislation will, in CBO’s assessment, partially mitigate the deterioration in economic conditions,"" he added.Since the virus pandemic hit the US the government and the central bank have provided trillions of dollars of support for the world's biggest economy.Still, unemployment has soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s as more than 40 million Americans have already been put out of work.America's unemployment rate hit 14.7% in April and on Friday the US Labor Department is expected to confirm that it reached 20% in May. In March that figure stood at just 4.4% having risen from a 50-year low from the month before.There is an ongoing debate in the US Congress over a new $3tn a new stimulus plan as well as a proposal to renew several federal aid programmes that would otherwise lapse, including a temporary increase to jobless benefits that is set to expire in July.The CBO is a federal agency within the US government that provides budget and economic information to Congress.",2 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Marriott reopens all hotels in China as travel rebounds,"Marriott has reopened all of its hotels in China and the group says it has seen a recovery in business travel.The world's third largest hotel chain has 350 outlets across China and says that occupancy rate is now at 40%.  Marriott gave an upbeat statement on Monday about its business in China as it emerges from coronavirus lockdowns.Last week it said the financial impact from the pandemic has been more severe for the hotel chain than 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis combined.Marriott chief executive Arne Sorenson said the occupancy rates at its Chinese hotels had been as low as 7% in late January when China was at its peak of cases. Mr Sorenson told a travel conference: ""It's not just leisure travel growing, but it is business travel. Chinese are flying again."" However, he warned that occupancy might not recover to pre-coronavirus levels for several years.Marriott said demand for hotel rooms in the US is also recovering but is currently only about half the level of its China properties at 20%.The hotel group, which owns about 30 brands including Ritz-Carlton, St Regis and Sheraton, has extended furloughs for employees and reduced working weeks until early October.""Given the company's expectation that prior levels of business will not return until beyond 2021, the company anticipates a significant number of above-property position eliminations later this year,"" it said in a statement. Rival Hilton reopened all of its 255 hotels in China two weeks ago and introduced a CleanStay initiative to protect employees and guests. The hotel and travel industry in China were among the first to be hit from the coronavirus outbreak, and look to be the slowest to recover as businesses and factories reopen across the country.Last month, Shanghai Disneyland reopened its gates although it introduced strict social distancing rules and limited daily visitors to about 24,000, compared to its pre-pandemic level of 80,000.",2 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Sex workers fear for their future,"With social distancing rules in place and strip clubs and brothels closed, sex workers around the world have seen their incomes disappear almost overnight as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Fearing for their livelihoods, as well as their health, some are offering services online to keep their business going, while others are turning to charities for help.Estelle Lucas has worked as an escort for the past 10 years in Melbourne, carefully building relationships with her clients. But the spread of Covid-19 and the need for social distancing has prompted a ban on sex work, leaving her worried those efforts will go to waste.  ""It's fair to say that if I'm not working for six months, a lot of people are going to forget me,"" she says.""I can't contact my clients and just have a conversation with them. That doesn't work in my industry. We need to build intimacy and that's just not possible in the current environment."" Before the coronavirus outbreak, Estelle says she was earning an above-average income, and had hoped to soon pay off the mortgage on her home in Melbourne's inner suburbs. Now nearly all her income has been lost. She has tried to adapt by moving her business online, but says that cannot replace physical contact.""Unfortunately, there are things that can't be translated,"" she says. ""I have made efforts to go online but not everyone is tech savvy. Some of my clients don't even really know how to use a smartphone.""While the regional government has outlined a clear roadmap to reopening restaurants and cafes, there has been no plan for the sex industry. That uncertainty, coupled with the many unknowns surrounding the virus itself, has left many sex workers with deep anxiety. ""I'm scared that all my work will come back to zero and I will just have to start hustling like I did when I first started out,"" Estelle says. She also fears for her clients' health. ""Are they even going to be there?"" she says. ""There's a lot of nervous energy going around.""Financial assistance from the Australian government is available to those who have lost their income because of the Covid-19 crisis, but to qualify for the payments workers need to be able to show they have been paying tax - something that unregistered sex workers including migrants and trans people, often won't be able to do. It's a problem facing sex workers in dozens of countries around the world, according to Teela Sanders, a criminology professor at the University of Leicester. ""Governments have been very good at providing social protection for the majority of people, particularly self-employed people, but sex workers are not included,"" she says.That's left sex worker collectives and advocacy groups calling for members of the public to donate to emergency funds. So far, an online appeal by the Las Vegas Sex Worker Collective has raised $19,300 (£15,680) while a campaign by a coalition of support groups in Italy has raised almost €21,700 (£19,500).""These have been a real lifeline to sex workers for immediate bill paying, access to food etc,"" says Prof Sanders. Some sex workers have been forced to continue working, risking hefty fines or exposure to the virus. ""In developing countries, sex workers are often the main breadwinner for the whole family, for their siblings, their children and their grandparents. So this affects the whole extended family,"" Prof Sanders says.Niki Adams from the English Collective of Prostitutes echoes that view. She told the BBC most sex workers in the UK are mothers and if they are continuing to work, it is because they are desperate for money. But some sex workers find themselves unable to keep working - even if they would choose to. In Daulatdia brothel in Bangladesh, police guard the entrance, preventing customers from entering. It is one of the world's biggest brothels, a shanty town made up of tin sheds and narrow alleyways that is home to 1,300 women and their 400 children.The brothel has been closed since March, leaving many of the women struggling to buy essential items and relying on donations from charities.  ""We cannot work now, so we don't have any income, which is scary,"" says ""Nazma"", who didn't want to give her real name. Nazma supports three children who live with her sister back in her village. She came to the brothel 30 years ago when she was just seven. Although she needs money, she worries about the dangers of working during the pandemic.""Even if we could work, people's lives are at risk from the virus. We'd be scared to go to bed with our clients anyway, as we don't know who is affected,"" she says.Daulatdia sits on the banks of the Padma River, near a major ferry terminal. It is the main transport hub that connects the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka with the country's southern districts. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, thousands of truck drivers would pass through the area every day, delivering agricultural products and other goods to Dhaka. Many of the women and children who live in the brothel are victims of trafficking. ""A lot of them who were kidnapped as children were sold there,"" says Srabanti Huda, a lawyer and human rights activist based in Dhaka.While the Bangladeshi government and local aid organisations have delivered some emergency funds to the women, Srabanti says it hasn't been enough and some women received nothing at all. ""The amount of donations they've received from the government does not even cover a packet of powdered milk for the children,"" she says. In early May, Srabanti organised a private aid delivery, distributing packets of basic supplies for each of the 1,300 women registered at the brothel. ""There was one woman who said she has not been able to get her insulin or diabetic medications for over a month,"" Srabanti says. ""Another said she has not been able to buy her blood pressure medications since the lockdown started two months ago.""Reduced access to healthcare services is an issue facing sex workers globally, according to Prof Sanders. The problem is particularly acute in areas where there is high demand for regular antiviral drugs from those living with HIV.""There's been real issues around access,"" she says. Prof Sanders is working with a team in Nairobi to develop an ""Uber-style"" app that will enable sex workers to order medication using their phones and have it delivered. ""It's sent directly to them via a mode of transport rather than the person coming into the clinic,"" she says. Back in Daulatdia brothel, another sex worker who didn't want to be named is returning from a trip to see her daughter, who lives in a nearby home for the children of sex workers. Even when the brothel reopens, it will take a long time for the industry to recover, she says.""People are afraid if they come to us, they might get infected,"" she says. ""We are afraid too. We might get infected from them. This fear of getting infected will come up all the time.""Additional reporting by Salman Saeed.",3 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: What's it like to be laid off over Zoom?,"When travel start-up Pana held a meeting for all of its employees over Zoom, they explained that some staff would be laid off, and that there would be two further calls that morning - one at 09:00 for those who would be laid off, and one at 09:45 for those who would not.Employees would know which meeting they were attending by the invites they would have received by email.Sales executive Ruthie Townsend was invited to join the 09:00 call but, due to the shock of the news, she could not remember which call was for those about to be laid off, and which was for those being retained.""Because it was such a highly stressful situation, it was hard to process what was going on so I got mixed up. I joined the 09:00 call as that was the invite I had, and once I realised that I was being laid off, I quickly turned off my video,"" she says. Ms Townsend was on the call with 15 of her colleagues, and executives from the company then walked these employees through the benefits, the severance package and the next steps.The company, based in Denver, Colorado, had been hit by the collapse in travel due to the coronavirus outbreak.But there had been a feeling that redundancies would be a last resort, and Ms Townsend had no idea what was coming that morning. That kind of shock is unfortunately commonplace at the moment, as companies are slashing staff numbers to cope with the economic fallout from the coronavirus.Before the crisis managers would usually have met staff face-to-face, to give them the bad news.Now video-conferencing tools, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams (MS Teams), are being used to replicate the formality of the meeting.Chris Malone, an audio visual technician at events company Sparq in the UK, feared for his role when it was explained to him that a HR representative would be on his next MS Teams call along with his line manager. His instincts proved correct, as he was told he was going to be laid off.For him, the use of a video call made the meeting formal, but more awkward than an in-person meeting or telephone call. ""I think if you were doing it over the phone, it would mean you don't have to look at someone but when you have the video call, you get dressed up to make it feel formal and to look presentable. ""Even though it is a video call, the pressure is there - and as you're not in the room with them there isn't a natural chemistry, connection or body language you can read off, and there's a little bit of a delay, you're waiting for someone else to say something,"" he says.However, Mr Malone believes that a one-to-one video call is still the best way a business can break the unfortunate news to an employee in the current circumstances. For Ms Townsend, there were pros and cons to having more than 15 people on the same call as her.""I don't think any way of making someone redundant over video conference is going to be ideal. If it's one-on-one, it's still going to be really hard and then your boss is going to see all of your emotions. I liked the group setting because I turned off my video, and I didn't have to say anything,"" she says. However, she believes that the group setting prevented her from asking important questions at the time. More Technology of BusinessSarah Evans, partner at law firm JMW, explains that communication prior to any announcement is key for employers. ""What many big businesses can do is conduct large meetings on Zoom, to make an announcement to the same people at the same time, so there's no miscommunication going around,"" she says.This would make it clear that redundancies or the furlough scheme are being considered for employees, and would also make clear what this means for the business, and how they intend to follow-up with individuals.It is key for employers to provide employees with time to absorb the information, ask questions and give people the opportunity to voluntarily be made redundant or furloughed. ""In redundancy cases, that would be at least a couple of meetings to go through opportunities to avoid redundancy and consider alternatives, and there's no reason why all of this can't be done on Zoom,"" she says.The use of video, phone call or in-person, is not a legal matter; it's merely a matter of etiquette. However, the group call, which Ruthie Townsend had experienced in the US, would not be allowed in the UK.""That wouldn't cut it in UK law, as you have a right to individual consultation. There's nothing wrong with a group call to announce potential redundancies but you shouldn't be making people redundant in the same video call,"" Ms Evans says. If this were the way a UK employer had acted, the employee might then have a case for unfair dismissal. The option to record video calls could also prove problematic in these cases. Peter Binning, a partner at law firm Corker Binning, explains that, generally speaking, anyone should ask for consent before recording a call of any kind. However, regardless of whether consent was asked for, given or not given, a recorded conversation could still be admissible in an unfair dismissal case. ""Whoever wants to use the evidence has to be able to prove that it had been properly recorded and was genuine but it would be a matter for the court or tribunal to decide whether that evidence should be admitted,"" Mr Binning says.And those wanting to snoop on people by deliberately joining a Zoom call where someone else is being made redundant would most definitely be breaking the law - as there are a number of criminal offences about intercepting communications in the regulations.While video may create new problems, it is the best replacement for a meeting in person. ""It will feel more uncomfortable to look someone in the eye, and the level of emotional frustration and anger will be more visible, but it is essential to delivering the message in an open, fair and transparent way to another person,"" says Stuart Duff, an expert on the psychology of leadership at business psychology consultancy Pearn Kandola.",2 June 2020,business
Carly Fiorina's journey from secretary to CEO,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Carly Fiorina, US business leader, political figure and philanthropist.It should give hope to any young person striving to reach the top, knowing that Carly Fiorina started her business career as a humble secretary.""I spent my time greeting visitors, answering phones, typing memos,"" she says. ""But I was really committed to the job, arriving early, and leaving late.""Mrs Fiorina, 65, is looking back on her 21-year-old self, who in 1976 got her first full-time job at a small property company in Palo Alto, California.From that modest start she went on to become the first female chief executive of a Fortune 50 company (the 50 largest firms in the US). This happened in 1999 when, aged 44, she was appointed to the top job at computer group Hewlett-Packard.Fortune magazine subsequently named her the most powerful woman in US business five years in a row, with the publication declaring that ""Carly Fiorina didn't just break the glass ceiling, she obliterated it"".However, her time at HP was not universally regarded as a success, with much criticism of her decision to merge the business with rival Compaq in 2001. And in 2005 she resigned after a disagreement with her fellow board members.Mrs Fiorina subsequently entered the political arena, first as an adviser to the late John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. McCain went on to lose the election to Barack Obama.Eight years later, she herself ran to become the Republican Party candidate for the 2016 presidential election. She dropped out after nine months, due to low polling numbers, with Donald Trump going on to win both the candidacy and, of course, the presidency. She said at the time that she was ""horrified"" by Trump.Born in 1954 in Austin, Texas, her family moved around a lot, due to her father's job. Her dad, Joseph Sneed, was a law professor who went on to become US deputy attorney general. Her mother was a painter.She got a degree in philosophy and medieval history from Stanford University in California, before gaining a Master of Business Administration from the University of Maryland.In 1980 she entered the technology sector when she joined US giant AT&T as a management trainee. Her rise at the company was meteoric. By 1990 she was the firm's first female vice president, and by 1995 she was a senior director at AT&T spinoff Lucent Technologies. It was also while at AT&T that she met her husband Frank, and they were married in 1985.Mrs Fiorina's success at the telecoms giant caught the attention of HP, who were looking for a fresh start after missing nine quarterly profit targets in a row. She was appointed to the top job at the company in July 1999.""When I arrived at HP I purposely brought no-one new in at the beginning,"" she says. ""I did that for a very explicit reason, which was to send a very clear message to the organisation that we could, and we would, figure out what the problem was, and we would fix it.""[However], I was brought in by the board to transform the company. Those were the words they used.""Under Mrs Fiorina's leadership, costs were reduced, and eventually 30,000 jobs were removed from the combined 145,000 HP and Compaq workforce. A further 80,000 employees took pay cuts at a business which at its peak was worth $87bn (£71bn). ""Of course it is incredibly difficult to have to fire people, to have to lay people off,"" she says. ""In that very difficult circumstance, the best I could do was to fully explain why.""Why are we having to lay people off? Because if we don't, we will go out of business like many of our peers.""When the merger between HP and Compaq went ahead in 2002, it was the biggest ever in the technology sector at the time, and created the world's largest seller of personal computers.Whether the merger was a success, however, is still hotly contested. Tech website ZDNet said in 2016 that HP and Compaq's coming together was ""the worst merger ever"". By contrast, the Huffington Post called it ""the merger that worked"".What is certain is that the HP board were unhappy with the profits and share price of the combined business, and Mrs Fiorina was asked to resign in 2005. Her severance package was reportedly worth $21m.""We did, in fact, restore a great company,"" she says. ""[But] we had a dysfunctional board. It was dysfunctional when I arrived. It was dysfunctional when I left.""If leading HP wasn't enough of a battle, Mrs Fiorina jumped into politics for a decade from 2006. After working for John McCain, she went on to stand as the Republican candidate in the 2010 US Senate election in California, but lost out to the Democratic Party incumbent.Mrs Fiorina then worked for the American Conservative Union, a right-wing lobbying organisation, before running to be the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. Looking back on this campaign, she says that ""the process itself is insane"".She adds: ""Meaning, when you think about the process the  candidates go through, does it really help someone to be a better leader? Does it help us to decide a better leader? I don't think so.""It is a really crazy process that goes on for far too long. It is far too driven by a media spectacle.""But with another US presidential election due to be held this autumn, what does she think of President Trump after his four years in office? She declines to comment.More The Boss features:While the worlds of politics and business can be tough, Mrs Fiorina's biggest fight came in 2009 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and subsequently required a double mastectomy.She says the experience taught her a great deal. ""While I hope to never go through cancer again, it was a very important part of my journey, and for that I'm grateful.""I learned and grew so much during this time - learned about love and friendship, grew in my faith, and valued the kindness of strangers.""Technology firm boss Mihai Ivascu says that Mrs Fiorina is an ""inspirational leader"". ""She does not limit herself to what she is expected to do,"" says Mr Ivascu, who runs London-based M3 Holdings, and was included on a ""Forbes 30 Under 30"" list of leading young entrepreneurs. ""And as she has said, leadership is about changing the status quo when it needs changing.""In recent years Mrs Fiorina, who lives with her husband in Washington DC, has dedicated most of her time to her charity work. This includes being the chair of Good360, which helps companies give their surplus merchandise to various charities, and running Unlocking Potential, which helps the bosses of charities improve their leadership skills.Looking back on the start of her career, and her days as a secretary, she says: ""I was going to be the best secretary out there. I had no idea where it would lead.""",1 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: How safe is it to get on a plane?,"One of the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic has been the massive reduction in air travel in recent months, with daily flights down some 80% since the start of the year.Some airlines have grounded their entire fleets, while others have been focusing on cargo flights, in an effort to help keep supply chains functioning and make what money they can.Now, however, many carriers are making plans to get back in the air. Ryanair, for example, says it plans to reintroduce 40% of its schedule from July, EasyJet is starting a limited service this month and hopes to resume flights on 75% of its route network by the end of August, while Air France KLM and Lufthansa will begin flying very limited schedules by the end of June. Hungarian carrier Wizz Air has already resumed flights.In the UK, the situation is complicated by the introduction of controversial quarantine rules on 8 June - which will force passengers to isolate themselves for two weeks after arriving in the country.But can passengers fly safely, or will they be at risk of infection?The Covid-19 coronavirus is still relatively new, so accurate data on how it can spread between aircraft passengers is in short supply. But previous studies have looked at the spread of other respiratory illnesses. Based on the available information, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention generally tries to track down people sitting in the two rows in front and the two rows behind passengers found to have serious infections.A 2018 study by researchers from Emory University in Atlanta attempted to model how passengers and crew moved about an aircraft, and how that might affect the transmission of infectious diseases.""A droplet-mediated respiratory infectious disease is unlikely to be directly transmitted beyond one metre from the infectious passenger. Thus, transmission is limited to one row in front of or in back of an infectious passenger,"" the researchers concluded.But contrary to this, earlier research - led by the same academics - had shown that in real life cases passengers with Sars or influenza actually appeared to have infected a number of people well outside their immediate area.Their explanation was that some of those who became ill had become infected in the airport, while embarking or disembarking from the plane, or from touching contaminated surfaces, rather than by breathing in infected droplets. The simulations also indicated that, because cabin crew moved around the aircraft and had numerous contacts with different passengers, they could generate several new infections, and concluded ""it is imperative that flight attendants not fly when they are ill"".Meanwhile, public health officials in Canada say they did not find any cases of further infection after two passengers on a flight from Guangzhou to Toronto were found to have Covid-19. The flight had 350 people on board, and lasted for 15 hours.Although many people might think that sitting in a confined space for long periods would inevitably spread infections, the chief engineer at aerospace giant Airbus insists that is not the case.Jean-Brice Dumont argues that the way modern aircraft are designed means that the air is intrinsically very clean. ""Every two to three minutes, mathematically, all the air is renewed,"" he says. ""That means 20 to 30 times per hour, the air around you is completely renewed.""Put simply, air is collected from outside the aircraft, normally through the engine, and mixed with recycled air from the cabin. The recycled air, which is reused in part to keep temperature and humidity at the correct levels, is passed through HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters that are similar to those used in hospitals. The Covid-19 virus is about 125 nanometres in diameter (a nanometre is a billionth of a metre) and is within the particle-size range that HEPA filters capture - 10 nanometres and above.Mr Dumont says: ""HEPA filters have standards, and the standards we use in commercial aviation are among the highest standards. They filter out 99.97% of particulates (small particles) of the size of Covid-19.""The flow of the air itself, he explains, is also designed to minimise infection risks. ""The air flows vertically. It is blown from above your head and evacuated from beneath your feet. That makes the level of propagation of anything in the air quite limited. So a passenger from row one, for example, cannot contaminate someone in row 20.""But is this enough? This regular flow of air, from top to bottom, can be disrupted by passengers leaving their seats or cabin crew moving up and down the aisles, thus altering the path of any airborne particles.And crucially, while HEPA filters do work, they can't capture all Covid-19 droplets or aerosols before you might breathe them in, says Dr Julian Tang, consultant virologist at the Leicester Royal Infirmary and associate professor at Leicester University. He is also one of the team behind a study, published this month, looking at minimising the airborne transmission of Covid-19 in enclosed spaces.""Filtration only works on mass airflows, most of the transmission during a plane journey will be those short-range face-to-face conversations. Close range aerosol transmission is what you have to be worried about on a plane, train or a bus - this is the biggest risk.""And even if you are further away, the risk is not eliminated, says Dr Tang. ""How long Covid-19 can remain airborne depends on a range of factors. It varies between different people, it varies depending on the state of your infection, and you can't say all the droplets will fall to the ground within two metres. ""Some smaller droplets can stay suspended and travel up to 16 metres - and they all could be carrying the virus.""Dr Tang and his fellow authors say there is accumulating evidence for the important role of airborne transmission when it comes to infectious diseases such as Covid-19 or Mers, Sars and influenza, something which they argue has been overlooked.But Mr Dumont believes that simple precautions, such as wearing masks, and coughing or sneezing into an elbow will minimise risks. ""I want to be precise on that. We want people to wear masks,"" he says. This, he claims, combined with the rapid replacement of air, should minimise exposure.So, would it also be a rational move to enforce social distancing on aircraft, for example by blocking out middle seats - a move contemplated by some airlines, but described by Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary as ""idiotic""?""We don't think so,"" says Mr Dumont. ""It doesn't add to the risk reduction, we believe."" Virologist Dr Tang disagrees: ""The problem is that if you're sitting next to somebody - 0.6 metres in economy, say - who's coughing and sneezing in that immediate area, that aerosol will reach you before it has time to reach the filtration system, get filtered and come back down again.""Meanwhile the International Air Transport Association (Iata), which represents airlines, has set out a detailed ""biosecurity roadmap"", which it is presenting as a blueprint to governments for reopening the industry.Much of what it has to say focuses not on the flight itself, but on the time spent in the airport - where large numbers of people could normally be expected to come into contact with one another. It wants that time to be minimised as much as possible.As a result, it is calling for:The actual flight is considered to be relatively low risk - and according to Iata vice president Nick Careem, ""physical distancing on board is not necessary"". The emphasis, he says, should be on enhanced and frequent deep cleaning of the cabin, as well as measures to avoid passengers congregating in specific areas. That could include banning queues for the washrooms.The key message, Mr Careem says is that ""there is no silver bullet, no single measure that can prevent infection"". Dr Tang, meanwhile, says he would fly with precautions. ""If I get on a plane, I'll be wearing a mask. It's not 100% but at least I'll have some protection.""",2 June 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Coronavirus: Australia set for first recession in three decades,"Australia is set for its first recession in 29 years as the country feels the impact of the virus pandemic.Official figures show that the economy shrank by 0.3% in the first three months of the year, amid bushfires and the early stages of the outbreak.Economists expect data for the current quarter to confirm that the shutdowns have pushed the country into recession.It comes even after the government and central bank stepped up measures to support the economy.The latest gross domestic product (GDP) figures highlight that the economy was struggling from a devastating bushfire season, a slowdown in tourism and weak domestic demand even before the virus-related restrictions started. ""This was the slowest through-the-year growth since September 2009, when Australia was in the midst of the global financial crisis, and captures just the beginning of the expected economic effects of Covid-19,"" Bureau of Statistics chief economist Bruce Hockman said.In March the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its main interest rate to a record low of 0.25%. The central bank also launched an unlimited bond buying programme.While the central bank kept the cost of borrowing on hold at its meeting on Tuesday, Governor Philip Lowe said the country was facing the toughest conditions since the Great Depression.""The Australian economy is going through a very difficult period and is experiencing the biggest economic contraction since the 1930s.""However, he did add a note of optimism to his outlook: ""It is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected.""""The rate of new infections has declined significantly and some restrictions have been eased earlier than was previously thought likely,"" he said.The Australian government has also pledged hundreds of billions dollars to help support businesses and individuals and has signalled that more stimulus measures would be announced soon.Last month Japan fell into recession for the first time since 2015 as the world's third biggest economy shrank at an annual pace of 3.4% in the first three months of the year.The week before Germany, Europe's largest economy, slipped into recession, while other big economies, including the UK and the US are also seeing sharp downturns.A recession is widely defined as two  quarters in a row of economic contraction, or shrinking GDP.",3 June 2020,business
Google in $5bn lawsuit for tracking in 'private' mode,"Google has been sued in the US over claims it illegally invades the privacy of users by tracking people even when they are browsing in ""private mode"".The class action wants at least $5bn (£4bn) from Google and owner Alphabet.Many internet users assume their search history isn't being tracked when they view in private mode, but Google says this isn't the case.The search engine denies this is illegal and says it is upfront about the data it collects in this mode.The proposed class action likely includes ""millions"" of Google users who since 1 June 2016 browsed the internet in private mode according to law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who filed the claim on Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, California.Incognito mode within Google's Chrome browser gives users the choice to search the internet without their activity being saved to the browser or device. But the websites visited can use tools such as Google Analytics to track usage.The complaint says that Google ""cannot continue to engage in the covert and unauthorized data collection from virtually every American with a computer or phone"".Vigorously denying the claims Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: ""As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity"".The search engine says the collection of search history, even in private viewing mode, helps site owners ""better evaluate the performance of their content, products, marketing and more.""While private browsing has been available from Google for some time, Boies Schiller Flexner said it recently decided to represent three plaintiffs based in the US.

"House prices see largest monthly fall for 11 years, says Nationwide","House prices fell 1.7% in May from the previous month, the largest monthly fall for 11 years, according to the Nationwide.Annual house price growth halved from 3.7% to 1.8%, as the coronavirus crisis hit market activity.The latest HMRC data showed that residential property transactions fell 53% in April compared with 2019.""The medium-term outlook for the housing market remains highly uncertain,"" the Nationwide warned.""We have already seen a sharp economic contraction as a result of the necessary measures adopted to suppress the spread of the virus,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.But he pointed out that the raft of policies adopted to support the economy should ""set the stage for a rebound once the shock passes"" and help limit long-term damage.""These same measures should also help ensure the impact on the housing market will ultimately be less than would normally be associated with an economic shock of this magnitude,"" he predicted.The figures are based on Nationwide's lending data, do not include cash purchases, and may have a greater volatility owing to the very low levels of activity.Yet, the big month-to-month drop in Nationwide's house price index in May - the largest since February 2009 - ""is just the start of a protracted decline over the remainder of this year,"" warned Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Before the pandemic struck the UK, the housing market had been steadily gathering momentum, the Nationwide said. Activity levels and price growth were edging up thanks to continued robust labour market conditions, low borrowing costs and a more stable political backdrop following the general election.""Behavioural changes and social distancing are likely to impact the flow of housing transactions for some time,"" Mr Gardner said. Recent Nationwide research suggested that one in eight people had put off moving because of the lockdown.  But the majority saw the current situation as a temporary pause in the market, with would-be buyers planning to wait six months on average before looking to enter the market.Early indicators of housing demand have picked up since in-person property viewings were permitted again on 13 May, said Pantheon Macroeconomics. It said the daily volume of Google searches for the three main property portals had increased to be just 13% below its pre-lockdown level, having been down 50% in April.""Relatively few people likely will be forced to sell their homes, given that mortgage payment holidays are easily available and home ownership has declined,"" said Mr Tombs. ""Nonetheless, the huge size of the blow from Covid-19 to households' incomes and the deterioration in consumers' confidence suggests that house prices must drop.""He predicted a 5% fall in prices by the end of the third quarter of the year.Separate figures from the Bank of England show how the mortgage market decelerated sharply alongside the house sales shutdown.Some 15,848 mortgage approvals for house purchases were recorded in April - about 80% below February levels before the coronavirus crisis took hold, the Bank said.This was around half the number of approvals taking place in the trough during the financial crisis, and the lowest since the figures started in 1993.Approvals for re-mortgaging fell by a lesser extent during the month, to 34,400, some 34% lower than in February.The UK's financial watchdog has confirmed the support firms should give to mortgage customers who are either coming to the end of a payment holiday or who are yet to request one.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said last month that homeowners struggling financially due to coronavirus would be able to extend their mortgage payment holiday for a further three months, or cut payments.On Tuesday, it confirmed customers yet to apply for a payment holiday have until 31 October 2020 to do so. Meanwhile the current ban on lender repossessions of homes will be continued to 31 October.""The measures we have confirmed today will mean anyone who needs to can get help from their lender, if they are still struggling to pay their mortgage due to coronavirus,"" said Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA.""It is important that if a consumer can afford to re-start mortgage payments, it is in their best interests to do so. Customers should talk to their firm about the best option available for them.""On Friday, the Nationwide's chief executive, Joe Garner, argued that it would be prudent for extensions to mortgage holidays to be marked temporarily on a borrower's credit file. However, the FCA said the current guidance - that taking a deferral should not have a negative impact on a borrower's credit file - should continue.The regulator pointed out that lenders could still use details obtained from other sources, such as bank account information, when making their decisions on whether to grant other loans.",2 June 2020,business
Coronavirus could ‘drag on US economy for a decade',"The drag on the US economy from the virus pandemic will last almost a decade, according to projections by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).It forecasts the outbreak will cut US economic output by 3% between this year and 2030, a loss of $7.9tn (£6.3tn).The warning comes as tens of millions of people are out of work due to lockdown measures.America's historic downturn comes even after trillions of dollars have been pumped into the economy.The nonpartisan CBO said the majority of the loss was caused by the sharp contraction in economic activity this year, which it had not predicted in its last 10-year report, published in January.“Business closures and social distancing measures are expected to curtail consumer spending, while the recent drop in energy prices is projected to severely reduce US investment in the energy sector,” CBO director Phillip Swagel wrote in response to an inquiry from Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.“Recent legislation will, in CBO’s assessment, partially mitigate the deterioration in economic conditions,"" he added.Since the virus pandemic hit the US the government and the central bank have provided trillions of dollars of support for the world's biggest economy.Still, unemployment has soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s as more than 40 million Americans have already been put out of work.America's unemployment rate hit 14.7% in April and on Friday the US Labor Department is expected to confirm that it reached 20% in May.
