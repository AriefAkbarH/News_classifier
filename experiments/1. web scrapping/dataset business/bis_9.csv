China scraps annual economic growth target for first time,"China will not set an economic growth goal for this year as it deals with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.It is the first time Beijing has not had a gross domestic product (GDP) target since 1990 when records began.The announcement was made by Premier Li Keqiang at the start of the country's annual parliament meeting.The world's second largest economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter from a year ago as lockdowns paralysed businesses.“This is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,” Premier Li said.The country's leadership has promised to boost economic support measures amid growing concerns that rising unemployment could threaten social stability.The move comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington are becoming increasingly strained over the coronavirus pandemic, trade and Hong Kong.On Thursday, President Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on China, suggesting that the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, is behind a “disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.”It came as Mr Trump and other Republicans have escalated their criticism of Beijing's handling of the early stages of the outbreak. Also on Thursday, China announced plans to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong after last year’s pro-democracy protests.The announcement was met with a warning from Mr Trump that the US would react “very strongly” against any attempt to gain more control over the former British colony.Separately, two US senators have proposed legislation to punish Chinese entities involved in enforcing the planned new laws and penalise banks that do business with them.Earlier this week, the US Senate unanimously passed a proposal to delist Chinese companies from American stock exchanges if they fail to comply with US financial reporting standards.US-listed Chinese companies have come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.",22 May 2020,business

How bad are China's economic woes?,"While economists say China's economic data can't always be trusted, they now have a new dilemma - there is no data.On Friday, China said it wouldn't be setting a target for economic growth for this year. That's unprecedented - the Chinese government hasn't done this since it began publishing such goals in 1990. Abandoning the growth target is an acknowledgement of just how difficult a recovery in China will be in a post pandemic era. And while recent figures have shown that China is on the way out of its slowdown: it's an uneven recovery. First, the good news. For the first time since the pandemic hit China - factories are making goods again.Industrial output in April grew by a better-than-expected 3.9% - a marked difference from the collapse of 13.5% in the first two months of this year as massive lockdowns were imposed. There's also a swathe of other data that has been surprisingly strong - pointing to what economists like to call a V-shaped recovery - a sharp, drastic initial fall - followed by a quick rebound in economic activity. Coal consumption by six major power generators surged back to historical norms after May's ""Golden week"" holidays, according to investment bank JP Morgan. It currently stands 1.5% above the historical average, suggesting that power demand has returned to normal.And the pollution-free Chinese skies that we saw in the aftermath of the lockdowns there - well, they've disappeared as economic activity has picked up. China's air pollution levels recently surpassed concentrations over the same period last year for the first time since the coronavirus crisis began, driven by industrial emissions. All of this shows that China is slowly getting back to business. But it's not business as usual, and this shows just how difficult it will be for the rest of us to get our economies going again. Recent retail sales figures show just how difficult it is going to be to get people into shops and buying things.Sales were down 7.5% in April - better than March - but nowhere near where they need to be for the economy to be running on full cylinders. Many Chinese people are still worried about a second wave of infection, and they're not spending as much as they used to.  It's no wonder China has abandoned it's growth target this year - the government knows it will be hard to forecast just how deep this crisis has become. Compounding all of that -  are the all-important unemployment figures - which officially came in slightly higher in April than in March, at 6%, edging closer to historical highs. But most economists say the real number is much worse. The ""true level of unemployment is likely double this"", given that around a fifth of migrant workers haven't returned to the cities, says the think tank Capital Economics. Even China's hard-line Communist mouthpiece the Global Times - typically the Chinese economy's biggest cheerleader - has pointed out how dire the employment picture is.It is saying that this year ""it will be nearly impossible for Chinese employees in the private sector to earn as much salary as they did in 2019,"" as small businesses have had to fire employees or cut staff.  It's going to get worse before it gets better. Some 85% of private enterprises will struggle to survive over the next three months, writes Prof Justin Yifu Lin of Peking University, citing a Tsinghua University survey in March. ""Bankruptcy of enterprises will lead to an increase in unemployment,"" he adds. Granted, many Chinese people are employed by state-owned enterprises, and China's economic system is able to absorb the ranks of the unemployed better than the US. Chinese people have more savings, better family support, and many migrant workers also have land back home that they can rely on for basic needs and even sustenance in the very worst of circumstances.""You will see a great transition of migrant workers going back to their villages where they have their own piece of land,"" Wang Huiyao of the Centre for China and Globalisation tells me. ""Yes, there will be some hardships, but people outside of China probably don't understand how we view hardships and difficulties - which Chinese people just experienced not too long ago when China was very poor. ""The Communist Party has always stated a growth target to achieve as a way of signalling how well China is doing.But clearly this time it's different: no target - so there's no getting away from the fact that the current economic environment is the most challenging China has faced in recent years. Indeed, China has been through difficult economic periods before - the 1990s, for instance, saw huge numbers of people laid off. The economy at the time was dominated by state-owned enterprises - they provided jobs for the bulk of the working population. As the economy slowed down, they shed millions of workers - and unemployment rose rapidly, by one percentage point every year according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. State-owned enterprises went from employing 60% of the working population in 1995 to 30% in 2002. But China recovered, and the private sector stepped in to hire young people.This time, it's different and the private sector is also under pressure, says economist George Magnus, associate at the China Centre, Oxford University. ""No one was talking about trade wars at that time. The great offshoring of manufacturing to China was underway. ""Now, the rest of the world is an economic funk - so there's no consumer demand, and nothing in terms of foreign trade. All of the headwinds that China was facing before the pandemic have been compounded by the coronavirus.""For the last 40 years, China's Communist Party has been able to promise a simple contract to its citizens: we'll keep your quality of life improving and you fall in line so that we can keep China on the right path. It is the social contract that China's leader Xi Jinping crystallised as the ""Chinese dream"" when he announced it in 2012. 2020 was meant to be a pivotal part of that grand plan - the year China would eliminate absolute poverty, raising the quality and standard of life for millions of people. But the coronavirus could be putting that social contract at risk. Arguably more than any other economic crisis in the Chinese Communist Party's history, this health crisis has become a major threat for social stability in the country. Millions of young people may not be guaranteed the same degree of success that their parents' generation has seen. Keeping that contract of wealth, employment and stability is key to the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy. Which is why economic recovery for China is so critical - and not having a growth target gives the government much needed flexibility to work out a plan. ",22 May 2020,business

China's air pollution levels recently surpassed concentrations over the same period last year for the first time since the coronavirus crisis began, driven by industrial emissions. All of this shows that China is slowly getting back to business. But it's not business as usual, and this shows just how difficult it will be for the rest of us to get our economies going again. Recent retail sales figures show just how difficult it is going to be to get people into shops and buying things.Sales were down 7.5% in April - better than March - but nowhere near where they need to be for the economy to be running on full cylinders. Many Chinese people are still worried about a second wave of infection, and they're not spending as much as they used to.  It's no wonder China has abandoned it's growth target this year - the government knows it will be hard to forecast just how deep this crisis has become. Compounding all of that -  are the all-important unemployment figures - which officially came in slightly higher in April than in March, at 6%, edging closer to historical highs. But most economists say the real number is much worse. The ""true level of unemployment is likely double this"", given that around a fifth of migrant workers haven't returned to the cities, says the think tank Capital Economics. Even China's hard-line Communist mouthpiece the Global Times - typically the Chinese economy's biggest cheerleader - has pointed out how dire the employment picture is.It is saying that this year ""it will be nearly impossible for Chinese employees in the private sector to earn as much salary as they did in 2019,"" as small businesses have had to fire employees or cut staff.  It's going to get worse before it gets better. Some 85% of private enterprises will struggle to survive over the next three months, writes Prof Justin Yifu Lin of Peking University, citing a Tsinghua University survey in March. ""Bankruptcy of enterprises will lead to an increase in unemployment,"" he adds. Granted, many Chinese people are employed by state-owned enterprises, and China's economic system is able to absorb the ranks of the unemployed better than the US. Chinese people have more savings, better family support, and many migrant workers also have land back home that they can rely on for basic needs and even sustenance in the very worst of circumstances.""You will see a great transition of migrant workers going back to their villages where they have their own piece of land,"" Wang Huiyao of the Centre for China and Globalisation tells me. ""Yes, there will be some hardships, but people outside of China probably don't understand how we view hardships and difficulties - which Chinese people just experienced not too long ago when China was very poor. ""The Communist Party has always stated a growth target to achieve as a way of signalling how well China is doing.But clearly this time it's different: no target - so there's no getting away from the fact that the current economic environment is the most challenging China has faced in recent years. Indeed, China has been through difficult economic periods before - the 1990s, for instance, saw huge numbers of people laid off. The economy at the time was dominated by state-owned enterprises - they provided jobs for the bulk of the working population. As the economy slowed down, they shed millions of workers - and unemployment rose rapidly, by one percentage point every year according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. State-owned enterprises went from employing 60% of the working population in 1995 to 30% in 2002. But China recovered, and the private sector stepped in to hire young people.This time, it's different and the private sector is also under pressure, says economist George Magnus, associate at the China Centre, Oxford University. ""No one was talking about trade wars at that time. The great offshoring of manufacturing to China was underway. ""Now, the rest of the world is an economic funk - so there's no consumer demand, and nothing in terms of foreign trade. All of the headwinds that China was facing before the pandemic have been compounded by the coronavirus.""For the last 40 years, China's Communist Party has been able to promise a simple contract to its citizens: we'll keep your quality of life improving and you fall in line so that we can keep China on the right path. It is the social contract that China's leader Xi Jinping crystallised as the ""Chinese dream"" when he announced it in 2012. 2020 was meant to be a pivotal part of that grand plan - the year China would eliminate absolute poverty, raising the quality and standard of life for millions of people. But the coronavirus could be putting that social contract at risk. Arguably more than any other economic crisis in the Chinese Communist Party's history, this health crisis has become a major threat for social stability in the country. Millions of young people may not be guaranteed the same degree of success that their parents' generation has seen. Keeping that contract of wealth, employment and stability is key to the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy. Which is why economic recovery for China is so critical - and not having a growth target gives the government much needed flexibility to work out a plan. ",22 May 2020,business
UK borrowing at record high as virus cost soars in April,"Government borrowing surged to £62bn in April, the highest monthly figure on record, after heavy spending to ease the coronavirus crisis.It means the deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - was larger last month than forecast for the whole year at the time of the Budget. The data from the Office for National Statistics revealed the soaring cost of support, such as furlough schemes.But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said things would be worse without government aid.The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach £298bn, more than five times the estimate at the time of the March Budget.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, described April's figure as ""pretty much unprecedented"". It said the cost of furlough schemes alone was £14bn in April.""Borrowing now is about six times what it was [in April] last year, so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances,"" Mr Athow told the BBC.He added it was impossible to forecast the current year's public finances because of the ""high amounts of uncertainty"". Tax receipts have fallen heavily, as the Treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments. The amount received from VAT in April was negative, with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments.Meanwhile, borrowing by the state in March 2020 has been revised up by £11.7bn to £14.7bn, the ONS said.It said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and National Insurance contributions.The surge in borrowing comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown.After publication of the figures, Mr Sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support, the cost to the economy and people's livelihoods would be much worse.""Our top priority is to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible,"" he said.""That's why we've taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts.""For the past decade, the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping, aiming for position where it could cover day-to-day spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit. But then the crisis hit - and as the chancellor claims, the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over, to prevent an even bigger economic disaster. It was worth ripping up the rulebook for, he said.However the bills are mounting, just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped.  This year's deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the Second World War - and that hole needs pluggingFor the moment, the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets, through bonds, effectively IOUs - but there is a limit to how much it can  do so. Ultimately, economists say taxes will have to rise, or spending cut - the emergency raft will have a price tag which we can't escapeBut the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery. And if he opts for tax hikes, he'll risk breaking some election promisesThe scale of the economic consequences was underlined on Friday in separate retail sales data from the ONS. These showed that High Street sales crashed last month as shops closed for the lockdown.It was also announced on Friday that a mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the pandemic has been extended for another three months.As a result of the jump in borrowing, total public sector debt rose to £1,888bn at the end of April - £118.4bn higher than April 2019.Former chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: ""We have to come to terms with the fact that Britain is poorer and the economy is smaller than it would have been.""Asked if the economy would bounce back, he said: ""Bounce is the wrong word, but it will recover."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, described April's borrowing as ""alarmingly high"", but added that a small easing of the lockdown from 13 May probably meant the government would not have to borrow as much this month.And despite the pressure on public finances, Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said there were no signs the government was struggling to raise money on the financial markets.""Record low interest rates mean the UK's higher debt burden should remain more than manageable,"" he said.

Coronavirus: US workers seeking jobless aid near 40 million,"A further 2.4 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, despite hopes that easing lockdown restrictions would help restart the US economy.The new filings brought the total since mid-March to roughly 38.6 million - almost a quarter of the workforce.The weekly figures have declined since peaking at almost 6.9 million at the end of March but remain high.The number of people remaining on benefits also continues to grow.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned this week that the US risked ""permanent damage"" if the lockdowns continued.All 50 states in the US have started to reopen but it is not clear whether simply easing restrictions will prompt activity to rebound.In the week ending 16 May, about 2.2 million people sought unemployment benefits under the government's pandemic relief programme, which expanded eligibility to people such as gig economy workers. Their numbers, which are reported separately from the regular figures, are likely to grow as more states implement the programme.""This is so tragic it is almost unfathomable,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, wrote on Twitter.Employers in the US cut more than 20 million jobs last month, sending the official unemployment rate to 14.7%, a sharp rise from 50-year lows of about 3.5% seen as recently as February. Economists have warned that the rate is likely to worsen and remain elevated for several years.While many of the unemployed said they believed their layoffs were temporary, a recent study estimated that more than 40% of recent pandemic job cuts are likely to be permanent.Companies such as Uber are among the firms that have announced significant job cuts in recent weeks, as they prepare for a prolonged slowdown. Retailers have also unveiled scores of permanent shop closures, with Victoria's Secret this week saying it would close some 250 locations in North America, with more expected.""Overall there is little evidence that the reopening of the economy has, as yet, led to any sudden snap back in employment,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.Nearly half of US households have lost income since the pandemic lockdowns came into effect two months ago, according to a survey published Wednesday by the US Census. About 37% expect to lose income in the next month.The effect on spending - which powers the US economy - has already been felt, with retail sales falling a record 16.4% in April, the Commerce Department reported last week.",21 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops,"British retail sales plummeted by a record amount in April as many stores closed amid the coronavirus outbreak.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the amount of goods sold fell by 18.1% last month.Clothing sales also halved as many High Street shops were shut under the lockdown measures introduced by the government in March.Online shopping as a proportion of all retail reached a record high of 30.7%, the ONS said.All types of shop, other than those selling clothing or household goods, saw record amounts being spent with them online.But the pick-up in online shopping failed to offset the collapse in spending on the High Street. ""The effects of Covid-19 have contributed to a record monthly fall in retail sales of nearly a fifth,"" ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said.He added that ""online shopping has again surged as people purchased goods from their homes"" amid lockdown.Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said that the shift to online had benefitted ""those retailers with the slickest e-commerce operations and who managed to cope with the shift in demand.""Online grocery retailers were one of the major beneficiaries as they worked at an incredible pace to boost capacity.""In April, the proportion of online spending on food increased from 5.7% to 9.3%, according to the ONS.Elsewhere, off-licence sales also continued to increase, seeing a slight uptick after a 23.9% jump in March.Mr Lim added that that the impact of lockdown had ""paralysed"" the industry.""Clothing retailers were the hardest hit as the absence of social interaction, whether that's going to work, seeing friends or heading off on holiday, decimated demand for new outfits,"" he said.The fall in non-food sales in April resulted in the lowest levels of clothing and shoe sales seen since the ONS starting collecting the data.Separate figures from retail research firm Springboard show that the number of shoppers visiting UK High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres fell by 80% in April amid the lockdown.That was almost double the level of March's downturn when there was a 41.3% drop in visits to shopping locations.Several fashion firms have been struggling as customers stay at home.Clothing giant Primark, for example, said last month it had gone from making £650m in sales a month to nothing after the coronavirus outbreak forced it to close its stores in Europe and the US.Despite the gloomy news, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Retail sales should recover some of April's lost ground in May.""He said that was despite the fact that lockdown measures on store closures in England have not changed significantly since they were introduced.This point was echoed by Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC: ""However bad April's figures are, we believe that retail has reached a turning point in the Covid-19 crisis. ""In the short term, May has already seen a loosening of lockdown restrictions across all the home nations.""Since the start of lockdown, garden centres have been allowed to open again in England. Other retailers classified as essential, such as DIY stores Homebase and B&Q, re-opened some sites around the end of April. ",22 May 2020,business
How bad are China's economic woes?,"While economists say China's economic data can't always be trusted, they now have a new dilemma - there is no data.On Friday, China said it wouldn't be setting a target for economic growth for this year. That's unprecedented - the Chinese government hasn't done this since it began publishing such goals in 1990. Abandoning the growth target is an acknowledgement of just how difficult a recovery in China will be in a post pandemic era. And while recent figures have shown that China is on the way out of its slowdown: it's an uneven recovery. First, the good news. For the first time since the pandemic hit China - factories are making goods again.Industrial output in April grew by a better-than-expected 3.9% - a marked difference from the collapse of 13.5% in the first two months of this year as massive lockdowns were imposed. There's also a swathe of other data that has been surprisingly strong - pointing to what economists like to call a V-shaped recovery - a sharp, drastic initial fall - followed by a quick rebound in economic activity.

Coronavirus: Flexible working will be a new normal after virus,"Facebook and New Zealand's Prime Minister are the latest supporters of flexible working as companies mull back-to-office strategies.On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shift towards a more remote workforce as a long-term trend.New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern this week suggested a four-day working week, partly to boost tourism in the country.As offices gradually re-open after coronavirus lockdown, more employers are looking at new ways of working.Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told staff it was ""aggressively opening up remote hiring"" in July. He expects half of its workforce to do their jobs outside Facebook's offices over the next five to 10 years.It follows moves by other tech firms in Silicon Valley, including Twitter, which said employees can work from home ""forever"" if they wish.  Flexible working policies suit staff who are anxious about returning to offices while giving breathing space to companies as they introduce new social distancing measures.Ms Ardern has suggested a four-day working week to help boost the economy and address work-life balancing. ""I hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day work week. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees. But as I've said there's just so much we've learnt about Covid and that flexibility of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that,"" Ardern said in a Facebook live video.Tech giant Microsoft trialled a four-day working week last year in Japan which was deemed successful in terms of employee feedback and productivity. It says it now has a ""hybrid workplace strategy as worksites slowly start to open"". ""Working from home remains optional through October for most employees,"" said a Microsoft spokesperson.Both working from home and shorter working weeks have been applauded by human resources experts as an alternative to a mass return to offices.""It would also give better work-life balance for the people who need it such as part-time students, new mothers, parents who want more time with kids [or] looking after the elderly,"" said Alin Abraham, a Singapore-based consultant.""If after Covid-19 employers learn how to employ flexible workers that would be a huge battle won for human resource management,"" she added. A shift towards more remote working also allows companies to rethink their expensive office space. Mastercard said it is currently looking at consolidating some of its offices while Facebook has plans for working ""hubs"" across the US.""Post Covid-19, you can imagine many companies shrinking down their real estate and employees can just work from home. It will be an interesting proposition to see how employers can cater to different crowds,"" said Adrian Tan, of workplace IT firm PeopleStrong.A growing list of business leaders are adding their weight to working from home and more flexible working arrangements, aided by technology and video-conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet.""As we start to return to workplaces and find a new normal, alternative working patterns will also help reduce commuter traffic and with social distancing measures,"" said HR consultant Emily Draycott-Jones.

China scraps annual economic growth target for first time,"China will not set an economic growth goal for this year as it deals with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.It is the first time Beijing has not had a gross domestic product (GDP) target since 1990 when records began.The announcement was made by Premier Li Keqiang at the start of the country's annual parliament meeting.The world's second largest economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter from a year ago as lockdowns paralysed businesses.“This is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,” Premier Li said.The country's leadership has promised to boost economic support measures amid growing concerns that rising unemployment could threaten social stability.The move comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington are becoming increasingly strained over the coronavirus pandemic, trade and Hong Kong.On Thursday, President Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on China, suggesting that the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, is behind a “disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.”It came as Mr Trump and other Republicans have escalated their criticism of Beijing's handling of the early stages of the outbreak. Also on Thursday, China announced plans to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong after last year’s pro-democracy protests.The announcement was met with a warning from Mr Trump that the US would react “very strongly” against any attempt to gain more control over the former British colony.Separately, two US senators have proposed legislation to punish Chinese entities involved in enforcing the planned new laws and penalise banks that do business with them.Earlier this week, the US Senate unanimously passed a proposal to delist Chinese companies from American stock exchanges if they fail to comply with US financial reporting standards.US-listed Chinese companies have come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.",22 May 2020,business
US Senate passes bill that could delist some Chinese firms,"The US Senate has passed a bill that could block some Chinese companies from selling shares on American stock exchanges.It would require overseas firms to follow US standards for audits and other financial regulations.The measure now has to be passed by the House of Representatives before being signed into law by President Trump.It comes as US-China tensions increase over the virus pandemic and after the Luckin Coffee accounting scandal.The planned legislation would also require publicly traded companies to reveal whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.The bill applies to all foreign companies, but is targeted at China, and follows intense criticism of Beijing by Mr Trump and other US politicians.Mr Trump and officials in his administration argue that China mishandled the coronavirus outbreak in its early stages.The outbreak has now grown to become a pandemic that has killed almost 330,000 people worldwide and crippled the global economy.US-listed Chinese companies have already come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.The company said its own investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of last year to the fourth quarter amounted to about 2.2bn yuan ($310m; £254m). That equates to about 40% of its estimated annual sales.The Chinese coffee chain has since sacked its chief executive and chief operating officer, while six other employees who were alleged to have been involved in or known about the transactions have been suspended or put on leave.The scandal-hit firm has said it has been co-operating with regulators in the US and China, who have begun an investigation into the company.Luckin's Nasdaq listing had been one of China's few successful US stock market debuts of 2019.On Tuesday Luckin said the Nasdaq exchange had notified the company of plans to delist it due to concerns over the alleged fabricated sales and disclosure failures. Its shares will trade on the exchange pending the outcome of an appeal, expected within 45 days.The scandal-hit firm's shares, which had been suspended since 7 April, plunged by more than 35% after they resumed trading on Wednesday.",21 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: What shape will the recession be?,"Even though countries are now moving towards easing lockdown restrictions, the coronavirus pandemic has already hit the global economy hard.Millions of people are out of work, financial markets have been rocked, and supply chains have faced major disruption as factories around the world have closed.The world is braced for recession even after governments and central banks have pumped trillions of dollars into their economies and slashed interest rates.""How bad will it be?"" and ""How soon will we recover?"" are two questions we'll be hearing a lot in the coming weeks and months.The answers to both of these questions will usually involve the use of one of four letters: V, U, W and L. That's because this is how economists often label recessions.These labels come from the shape of the charts typically seen during these periods that track economic activity such as employment, gross domestic product (GDP) - or economic growth - and industrial output.Here we look at those four letters and what they would mean to hopes of an economic recovery.This is considered to be the best-case scenario as this sort of downturn begins with a sharp fall, but then bottoms out and economic recovery quickly follows.It would mean the recession would last only a few quarters before a swift return to growth, bringing the economy back to where it was before the coronavirus pandemic.A classic example of a V-shaped recession happened in America in 1953 when the booming post-World War Two economy was upended by high interest rates. After a steep decline growth was soaring again just over a year later.This is similar to a V-shaped recession but lasts longer. In this scenario GDP typically shrinks for several quarters in a row, and only slowly returns to the level of growth seen before the downturn.America had a U-shaped recession in the early to mid 1970s. At the start of 1973 the US economy began to contract sharply and continued to have very low growth for almost two years. It only returned to its previous rate of expansion in 1975.This is when a recession starts by looking like it will be a V-shaped downturn, but then falls again after what turns out to be a false sign of recovery. It is also known as a double-dip recession, because the economy drops twice before it recovers to its previous growth rate.The US recession of the early 1980s was in effect two recessions with the economy shrinking from January 1980 to July that year. That was followed by a period of sharp expansion before the economy fell back into recession a year later, only recovering at the end of 1982.This is the worst-case scenario. It also goes by another name: ""depression"". It is when an economy experiences a deep recession and does not recover to its previous rate of growth for several years, if ever.Japan's so-called ""lost-decade"" of the 1990s is a textbook example of an L-shaped recession.The country had seen solid economic growth from the years immediately after World War Two until the end of the 1980s. That led to what turned out to be a massive over-pricing of assets or ""bubble"". Since that bubble burst in the early 1990s Japan has continued to experience weak growth and has yet to return to the pace of expansion seen from 1950 to 1990.Which of these recessions we will actually see in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic is, unsurprisingly, the subject of heated debate.And, of course, foreseeing the future of economies is, at best, inexact and any predictions can be taken with a pinch of salt. In the words of the late economist John Kenneth Galbraith: ""The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.""",10 May 2020,business

The economy at the time was dominated by state-owned enterprises - they provided jobs for the bulk of the working population. As the economy slowed down, they shed millions of workers - and unemployment rose rapidly, by one percentage point every year according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.

US Senate passes bill that could delist some Chinese firms,"The US Senate has passed a bill that could block some Chinese companies from selling shares on American stock exchanges.It would require overseas firms to follow US standards for audits and other financial regulations.The measure now has to be passed by the House of Representatives before being signed into law by President Trump.It comes as US-China tensions increase over the virus pandemic and after the Luckin Coffee accounting scandal.The planned legislation would also require publicly traded companies to reveal whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.The bill applies to all foreign companies, but is targeted at China, and follows intense criticism of Beijing by Mr Trump and other US politicians.Mr Trump and officials in his administration argue that China mishandled the coronavirus outbreak in its early stages.The outbreak has now grown to become a pandemic that has killed almost 330,000 people worldwide and crippled the global economy.US-listed Chinese companies have already come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.The company said its own investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of last year to the fourth quarter amounted to about 2.2bn yuan ($310m; £254m). That equates to about 40% of its estimated annual sales.The Chinese coffee chain has since sacked its chief executive and chief operating officer, while six other employees who were alleged to have been involved in or known about the transactions have been suspended or put on leave.The scandal-hit firm has said it has been co-operating with regulators in the US and China, who have begun an investigation into the company.Luckin's Nasdaq listing had been one of China's few successful US stock market debuts of 2019.On Tuesday Luckin said the Nasdaq exchange had notified the company of plans to delist it due to concerns over the alleged fabricated sales and disclosure failures. Its shares will trade on the exchange pending the outcome of an appeal, expected within 45 days.The scandal-hit firm's shares, which had been suspended since 7 April, plunged by more than 35% after they resumed trading on Wednesday.",21 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: What shape will the recession be?,"Even though countries are now moving towards easing lockdown restrictions, the coronavirus pandemic has already hit the global economy hard.Millions of people are out of work, financial markets have been rocked, and supply chains have faced major disruption as factories around the world have closed.The world is braced for recession even after governments and central banks have pumped trillions of dollars into their economies and slashed interest rates.""How bad will it be?"" and ""How soon will we recover?"" are two questions we'll be hearing a lot in the coming weeks and months.The answers to both of these questions will usually involve the use of one of four letters: V, U, W and L. That's because this is how economists often label recessions.These labels come from the shape of the charts typically seen during these periods that track economic activity such as employment, gross domestic product (GDP) - or economic growth - and industrial output.Here we look at those four letters and what they would mean to hopes of an economic recovery.This is considered to be the best-case scenario as this sort of downturn begins with a sharp fall, but then bottoms out and economic recovery quickly follows.It would mean the recession would last only a few quarters before a swift return to growth, bringing the economy back to where it was before the coronavirus pandemic.A classic example of a V-shaped recession happened in America in 1953 when the booming post-World War Two economy was upended by high interest rates. After a steep decline growth was soaring again just over a year later.This is similar to a V-shaped recession but lasts longer. In this scenario GDP typically shrinks for several quarters in a row, and only slowly returns to the level of growth seen before the downturn.America had a U-shaped recession in the early to mid 1970s. At the start of 1973 the US economy began to contract sharply and continued to have very low growth for almost two years. It only returned to its previous rate of expansion in 1975.This is when a recession starts by looking like it will be a V-shaped downturn, but then falls again after what turns out to be a false sign of recovery. It is also known as a double-dip recession, because the economy drops twice before it recovers to its previous growth rate.The US recession of the early 1980s was in effect two recessions with the economy shrinking from January 1980 to July that year. That was followed by a period of sharp expansion before the economy fell back into recession a year later, only recovering at the end of 1982.This is the worst-case scenario. It also goes by another name: ""depression"". It is when an economy experiences a deep recession and does not recover to its previous rate of growth for several years, if ever.Japan's so-called ""lost-decade"" of the 1990s is a textbook example of an L-shaped recession.The country had seen solid economic growth from the years immediately after World War Two until the end of the 1980s. That led to what turned out to be a massive over-pricing of assets or ""bubble"". Since that bubble burst in the early 1990s Japan has continued to experience weak growth and has yet to return to the pace of expansion seen from 1950 to 1990.Which of these recessions we will actually see in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic is, unsurprisingly, the subject of heated debate.And, of course, foreseeing the future of economies is, at best, inexact and any predictions can be taken with a pinch of salt. In the words of the late economist John Kenneth Galbraith: ""The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.""",10 May 2020,business
How bad are China's economic woes?,"While economists say China's economic data can't always be trusted, they now have a new dilemma - there is no data.On Friday, China said it wouldn't be setting a target for economic growth for this year. That's unprecedented - the Chinese government hasn't done this since it began publishing such goals in 1990. Abandoning the growth target is an acknowledgement of just how difficult a recovery in China will be in a post pandemic era. And while recent figures have shown that China is on the way out of its slowdown: it's an uneven recovery. First, the good news. For the first time since the pandemic hit China - factories are making goods again.Industrial output in April grew by a better-than-expected 3.9% - a marked difference from the collapse of 13.5% in the first two months of this year as massive lockdowns were imposed. There's also a swathe of other data that has been surprisingly strong - pointing to what economists like to call a V-shaped recovery - a sharp, drastic initial fall - followed by a quick rebound in economic activity. Coal consumption by six major power generators surged back to historical norms after May's ""Golden week"" holidays, according to investment bank JP Morgan. It currently stands 1.5% above the historical average, suggesting that power demand has returned to normal.And the pollution-free Chinese skies that we saw in the aftermath of the lockdowns there - well, they've disappeared as economic activity has picked up. China's air pollution levels recently surpassed concentrations over the same period last year for the first time since the coronavirus crisis began, driven by industrial emissions. All of this shows that China is slowly getting back to business. But it's not business as usual, and this shows just how difficult it will be for the rest of us to get our economies going again. Recent retail sales figures show just how difficult it is going to be to get people into shops and buying things.Sales were down 7.5% in April - better than March - but nowhere near where they need to be for the economy to be running on full cylinders. Many Chinese people are still worried about a second wave of infection, and they're not spending as much as they used to.  It's no wonder China has abandoned it's growth target this year - the government knows it will be hard to forecast just how deep this crisis has become. Compounding all of that -  are the all-important unemployment figures - which officially came in slightly higher in April than in March, at 6%, edging closer to historical highs.

UK borrowing at record high as virus cost soars in April,"Government borrowing surged to £62bn in April, the highest monthly figure on record, after heavy spending to ease the coronavirus crisis.It means the deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - was larger last month than forecast for the whole year at the time of the Budget. The data from the Office for National Statistics revealed the soaring cost of support, such as furlough schemes.But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said things would be worse without government aid.The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach £298bn, more than five times the estimate at the time of the March Budget.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, described April's figure as ""pretty much unprecedented"". It said the cost of furlough schemes alone was £14bn in April.""Borrowing now is about six times what it was [in April] last year, so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances,"" Mr Athow told the BBC.He added it was impossible to forecast the current year's public finances because of the ""high amounts of uncertainty"". Tax receipts have fallen heavily, as the Treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments. The amount received from VAT in April was negative, with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments.Meanwhile, borrowing by the state in March 2020 has been revised up by £11.7bn to £14.7bn, the ONS said.It said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and National Insurance contributions.The surge in borrowing comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown.After publication of the figures, Mr Sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support, the cost to the economy and people's livelihoods would be much worse.""Our top priority is to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible,"" he said.""That's why we've taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts.""For the past decade, the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping, aiming for position where it could cover day-to-day spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit. But then the crisis hit - and as the chancellor claims, the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over, to prevent an even bigger economic disaster. It was worth ripping up the rulebook for, he said.However the bills are mounting, just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped.  This year's deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the Second World War - and that hole needs pluggingFor the moment, the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets, through bonds, effectively IOUs - but there is a limit to how much it can  do so. Ultimately, economists say taxes will have to rise, or spending cut - the emergency raft will have a price tag which we can't escapeBut the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery. And if he opts for tax hikes, he'll risk breaking some election promisesThe scale of the economic consequences was underlined on Friday in separate retail sales data from the ONS. These showed that High Street sales crashed last month as shops closed for the lockdown.It was also announced on Friday that a mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the pandemic has been extended for another three months.As a result of the jump in borrowing, total public sector debt rose to £1,888bn at the end of April - £118.4bn higher than April 2019.Former chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: ""We have to come to terms with the fact that Britain is poorer and the economy is smaller than it would have been.""Asked if the economy would bounce back, he said: ""Bounce is the wrong word, but it will recover."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, described April's borrowing as ""alarmingly high"", but added that a small easing of the lockdown from 13 May probably meant the government would not have to borrow as much this month.And despite the pressure on public finances, Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said there were no signs the government was struggling to raise money on the financial markets.""Record low interest rates mean the UK's higher debt burden should remain more than manageable,"" he said.

Coronavirus: US workers seeking jobless aid near 40 million,"A further 2.4 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, despite hopes that easing lockdown restrictions would help restart the US economy.The new filings brought the total since mid-March to roughly 38.6 million - almost a quarter of the workforce.The weekly figures have declined since peaking at almost 6.9 million at the end of March but remain high.The number of people remaining on benefits also continues to grow.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned this week that the US risked ""permanent damage"" if the lockdowns continued.All 50 states in the US have started to reopen but it is not clear whether simply easing restrictions will prompt activity to rebound.In the week ending 16 May, about 2.2 million people sought unemployment benefits under the government's pandemic relief programme, which expanded eligibility to people such as gig economy workers. Their numbers, which are reported separately from the regular figures, are likely to grow as more states implement the programme.""This is so tragic it is almost unfathomable,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, wrote on Twitter.Employers in the US cut more than 20 million jobs last month, sending the official unemployment rate to 14.7%, a sharp rise from 50-year lows of about 3.5% seen as recently as February. Economists have warned that the rate is likely to worsen and remain elevated for several years.While many of the unemployed said they believed their layoffs were temporary, a recent study estimated that more than 40% of recent pandemic job cuts are likely to be permanent.Companies such as Uber are among the firms that have announced significant job cuts in recent weeks, as they prepare for a prolonged slowdown. Retailers have also unveiled scores of permanent shop closures, with Victoria's Secret this week saying it would close some 250 locations in North America, with more expected.""Overall there is little evidence that the reopening of the economy has, as yet, led to any sudden snap back in employment,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.Nearly half of US households have lost income since the pandemic lockdowns came into effect two months ago, according to a survey published Wednesday by the US Census. About 37% expect to lose income in the next month.The effect on spending - which powers the US economy - has already been felt, with retail sales falling a record 16.4% in April, the Commerce Department reported last week.",21 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops,"British retail sales plummeted by a record amount in April as many stores closed amid the coronavirus outbreak.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the amount of goods sold fell by 18.1% last month.Clothing sales also halved as many High Street shops were shut under the lockdown measures introduced by the government in March.Online shopping as a proportion of all retail reached a record high of 30.7%, the ONS said.All types of shop, other than those selling clothing or household goods, saw record amounts being spent with them online.But the pick-up in online shopping failed to offset the collapse in spending on the High Street. ""The effects of Covid-19 have contributed to a record monthly fall in retail sales of nearly a fifth,"" ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said.He added that ""online shopping has again surged as people purchased goods from their homes"" amid lockdown.Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said that the shift to online had benefitted ""those retailers with the slickest e-commerce operations and who managed to cope with the shift in demand.""Online grocery retailers were one of the major beneficiaries as they worked at an incredible pace to boost capacity.""In April, the proportion of online spending on food increased from 5.7% to 9.3%, according to the ONS.Elsewhere, off-licence sales also continued to increase, seeing a slight uptick after a 23.9% jump in March.Mr Lim added that that the impact of lockdown had ""paralysed"" the industry.""Clothing retailers were the hardest hit as the absence of social interaction, whether that's going to work, seeing friends or heading off on holiday, decimated demand for new outfits,"" he said.The fall in non-food sales in April resulted in the lowest levels of clothing and shoe sales seen since the ONS starting collecting the data.Separate figures from retail research firm Springboard show that the number of shoppers visiting UK High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres fell by 80% in April amid the lockdown.That was almost double the level of March's downturn when there was a 41.3% drop in visits to shopping locations.Several fashion firms have been struggling as customers stay at home.Clothing giant Primark, for example, said last month it had gone from making £650m in sales a month to nothing after the coronavirus outbreak forced it to close its stores in Europe and the US.Despite the gloomy news, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Retail sales should recover some of April's lost ground in May.""He said that was despite the fact that lockdown measures on store closures in England have not changed significantly since they were introduced.This point was echoed by Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC: ""However bad April's figures are, we believe that retail has reached a turning point in the Covid-19 crisis. ""In the short term, May has already seen a loosening of lockdown restrictions across all the home nations.""Since the start of lockdown, garden centres have been allowed to open again in England. Other retailers classified as essential, such as DIY stores Homebase and B&Q, re-opened some sites around the end of April. ",22 May 2020,business

Coronavirus: Flexible working will be a new normal after virus,"Facebook and New Zealand's Prime Minister are the latest supporters of flexible working as companies mull back-to-office strategies.On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shift towards a more remote workforce as a long-term trend.New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern this week suggested a four-day working week, partly to boost tourism in the country.As offices gradually re-open after coronavirus lockdown, more employers are looking at new ways of working.Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told staff it was ""aggressively opening up remote hiring"" in July. He expects half of its workforce to do their jobs outside Facebook's offices over the next five to 10 years.It follows moves by other tech firms in Silicon Valley, including Twitter, which said employees can work from home ""forever"" if they wish.  Flexible working policies suit staff who are anxious about returning to offices while giving breathing space to companies as they introduce new social distancing measures.Ms Ardern has suggested a four-day working week to help boost the economy and address work-life balancing. ""I hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day work week. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees. But as I've said there's just so much we've learnt about Covid and that flexibility of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that,"" Ardern said in a Facebook live video.Tech giant Microsoft trialled a four-day working week last year in Japan which was deemed successful in terms of employee feedback and productivity. It says it now has a ""hybrid workplace strategy as worksites slowly start to open"". ""Working from home remains optional through October for most employees,"" said a Microsoft spokesperson.Both working from home and shorter working weeks have been applauded by human resources experts as an alternative to a mass return to offices.""It would also give better work-life balance for the people who need it such as part-time students, new mothers, parents who want more time with kids [or] looking after the elderly,"" said Alin Abraham, a Singapore-based consultant.""If after Covid-19 employers learn how to employ flexible workers that would be a huge battle won for human resource management,"" she added. A shift towards more remote working also allows companies to rethink their expensive office space.

UK borrowing at record high as virus cost soars in April,"Government borrowing surged to £62bn in April, the highest monthly figure on record, after heavy spending to ease the coronavirus crisis.It means the deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - was larger last month than forecast for the whole year at the time of the Budget. The data from the Office for National Statistics revealed the soaring cost of support, such as furlough schemes.But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said things would be worse without government aid.The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach £298bn, more than five times the estimate at the time of the March Budget.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, described April's figure as ""pretty much unprecedented"". It said the cost of furlough schemes alone was £14bn in April.""Borrowing now is about six times what it was [in April] last year, so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances,"" Mr Athow told the BBC.He added it was impossible to forecast the current year's public finances because of the ""high amounts of uncertainty"". Tax receipts have fallen heavily, as the Treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments. The amount received from VAT in April was negative, with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments.Meanwhile, borrowing by the state in March 2020 has been revised up by £11.7bn to £14.7bn, the ONS said.It said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and National Insurance contributions.The surge in borrowing comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown.After publication of the figures, Mr Sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support, the cost to the economy and people's livelihoods would be much worse.""Our top priority is to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible,"" he said.""That's why we've taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts.""For the past decade, the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping, aiming for position where it could cover day-to-day spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit. But then the crisis hit - and as the chancellor claims, the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over, to prevent an even bigger economic disaster. It was worth ripping up the rulebook for, he said.However the bills are mounting, just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped.  This year's deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the Second World War - and that hole needs pluggingFor the moment, the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets, through bonds, effectively IOUs - but there is a limit to how much it can  do so. Ultimately, economists say taxes will have to rise, or spending cut - the emergency raft will have a price tag which we can't escapeBut the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery. And if he opts for tax hikes, he'll risk breaking some election promisesThe scale of the economic consequences was underlined on Friday in separate retail sales data from the ONS. These showed that High Street sales crashed last month as shops closed for the lockdown.It was also announced on Friday that a mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the pandemic has been extended for another three months.As a result of the jump in borrowing, total public sector debt rose to £1,888bn at the end of April - £118.4bn higher than April 2019.Former chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: ""We have to come to terms with the fact that Britain is poorer and the economy is smaller than it would have been.""Asked if the economy would bounce back, he said: ""Bounce is the wrong word, but it will recover."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, described April's borrowing as ""alarmingly high"", but added that a small easing of the lockdown from 13 May probably meant the government would not have to borrow as much this month.And despite the pressure on public finances, Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said there were no signs the government was struggling to raise money on the financial markets.""Record low interest rates mean the UK's higher debt burden should remain more than manageable,"" he said.

Coronavirus: US workers seeking jobless aid near 40 million,"A further 2.4 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, despite hopes that easing lockdown restrictions would help restart the US economy.The new filings brought the total since mid-March to roughly 38.6 million - almost a quarter of the workforce.The weekly figures have declined since peaking at almost 6.9 million at the end of March but remain high.The number of people remaining on benefits also continues to grow.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned this week that the US risked ""permanent damage"" if the lockdowns continued.All 50 states in the US have started to reopen but it is not clear whether simply easing restrictions will prompt activity to rebound.In the week ending 16 May, about 2.2 million people sought unemployment benefits under the government's pandemic relief programme, which expanded eligibility to people such as gig economy workers. Their numbers, which are reported separately from the regular figures, are likely to grow as more states implement the programme.""This is so tragic it is almost unfathomable,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, wrote on Twitter.Employers in the US cut more than 20 million jobs last month, sending the official unemployment rate to 14.7%, a sharp rise from 50-year lows of about 3.5% seen as recently as February. Economists have warned that the rate is likely to worsen and remain elevated for several years.While many of the unemployed said they believed their layoffs were temporary, a recent study estimated that more than 40% of recent pandemic job cuts are likely to be permanent.Companies such as Uber are among the firms that have announced significant job cuts in recent weeks, as they prepare for a prolonged slowdown. Retailers have also unveiled scores of permanent shop closures, with Victoria's Secret this week saying it would close some 250 locations in North America, with more expected.""Overall there is little evidence that the reopening of the economy has, as yet, led to any sudden snap back in employment,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.Nearly half of US households have lost income since the pandemic lockdowns came into effect two months ago, according to a survey published Wednesday by the US Census. About 37% expect to lose income in the next month.The effect on spending - which powers the US economy - has already been felt, with retail sales falling a record 16.4% in April, the Commerce Department reported last week.",21 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops,"British retail sales plummeted by a record amount in April as many stores closed amid the coronavirus outbreak.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the amount of goods sold fell by 18.1% last month.Clothing sales also halved as many High Street shops were shut under the lockdown measures introduced by the government in March.Online shopping as a proportion of all retail reached a record high of 30.7%, the ONS said.All types of shop, other than those selling clothing or household goods, saw record amounts being spent with them online.But the pick-up in online shopping failed to offset the collapse in spending on the High Street. ""The effects of Covid-19 have contributed to a record monthly fall in retail sales of nearly a fifth,"" ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said.He added that ""online shopping has again surged as people purchased goods from their homes"" amid lockdown.Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said that the shift to online had benefitted ""those retailers with the slickest e-commerce operations and who managed to cope with the shift in demand.""Online grocery retailers were one of the major beneficiaries as they worked at an incredible pace to boost capacity.""In April, the proportion of online spending on food increased from 5.7% to 9.3%, according to the ONS.Elsewhere, off-licence sales also continued to increase, seeing a slight uptick after a 23.9% jump in March.Mr Lim added that that the impact of lockdown had ""paralysed"" the industry.""Clothing retailers were the hardest hit as the absence of social interaction, whether that's going to work, seeing friends or heading off on holiday, decimated demand for new outfits,"" he said.The fall in non-food sales in April resulted in the lowest levels of clothing and shoe sales seen since the ONS starting collecting the data.Separate figures from retail research firm Springboard show that the number of shoppers visiting UK High Streets, retail parks and shopping centres fell by 80% in April amid the lockdown.That was almost double the level of March's downturn when there was a 41.3% drop in visits to shopping locations.Several fashion firms have been struggling as customers stay at home.Clothing giant Primark, for example, said last month it had gone from making £650m in sales a month to nothing after the coronavirus outbreak forced it to close its stores in Europe and the US.Despite the gloomy news, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Retail sales should recover some of April's lost ground in May.""He said that was despite the fact that lockdown measures on store closures in England have not changed significantly since they were introduced.This point was echoed by Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC: ""However bad April's figures are, we believe that retail has reached a turning point in the Covid-19 crisis. ""In the short term, May has already seen a loosening of lockdown restrictions across all the home nations.""Since the start of lockdown, garden centres have been allowed to open again in England. Other retailers classified as essential, such as DIY stores Homebase and B&Q, re-opened some sites around the end of April. ",22 May 2020,business
How bad are China's economic woes?,"While economists say China's economic data can't always be trusted, they now have a new dilemma - there is no data.On Friday, China said it wouldn't be setting a target for economic growth for this year. That's unprecedented - the Chinese government hasn't done this since it began publishing such goals in 1990. Abandoning the growth target is an acknowledgement of just how difficult a recovery in China will be in a post pandemic era. And while recent figures have shown that China is on the way out of its slowdown: it's an uneven recovery. First, the good news. For the first time since the pandemic hit China - factories are making goods again.Industrial output in April grew by a better-than-expected 3.9% - a marked difference from the collapse of 13.5% in the first two months of this year as massive lockdowns were imposed. There's also a swathe of other data that has been surprisingly strong - pointing to what economists like to call a V-shaped recovery - a sharp, drastic initial fall - followed by a quick rebound in economic activity. Coal consumption by six major power generators surged back to historical norms after May's ""Golden week"" holidays, according to investment bank JP Morgan. It currently stands 1.5% above the historical average, suggesting that power demand has returned to normal.And the pollution-free Chinese skies that we saw in the aftermath of the lockdowns there - well, they've disappeared as economic activity has picked up. China's air pollution levels recently surpassed concentrations over the same period last year for the first time since the coronavirus crisis began, driven by industrial emissions. All of this shows that China is slowly getting back to business. But it's not business as usual, and this shows just how difficult it will be for the rest of us to get our economies going again. Recent retail sales figures show just how difficult it is going to be to get people into shops and buying things.Sales were down 7.5% in April - better than March - but nowhere near where they need to be for the economy to be running on full cylinders. Many Chinese people are still worried about a second wave of infection, and they're not spending as much as they used to.  It's no wonder China has abandoned it's growth target this year - the government knows it will be hard to forecast just how deep this crisis has become. Compounding all of that -  are the all-important unemployment figures - which officially came in slightly higher in April than in March, at 6%, edging closer to historical highs. But most economists say the real number is much worse. The ""true level of unemployment is likely double this"", given that around a fifth of migrant workers haven't returned to the cities, says the think tank Capital Economics. Even China's hard-line Communist mouthpiece the Global Times - typically the Chinese economy's biggest cheerleader - has pointed out how dire the employment picture is.It is saying that this year ""it will be nearly impossible for Chinese employees in the private sector to earn as much salary as they did in 2019,"" as small businesses have had to fire employees or cut staff.  It's going to get worse before it gets better. Some 85% of private enterprises will struggle to survive over the next three months, writes Prof Justin Yifu Lin of Peking University, citing a Tsinghua University survey in March. ""Bankruptcy of enterprises will lead to an increase in unemployment,"" he adds. Granted, many Chinese people are employed by state-owned enterprises, and China's economic system is able to absorb the ranks of the unemployed better than the US. Chinese people have more savings, better family support, and many migrant workers also have land back home that they can rely on for basic needs and even sustenance in the very worst of circumstances.""You will see a great transition of migrant workers going back to their villages where they have their own piece of land,"" Wang Huiyao of the Centre for China and Globalisation tells me. ""Yes, there will be some hardships, but people outside of China probably don't understand how we view hardships and difficulties - which Chinese people just experienced not too long ago when China was very poor. ""The Communist Party has always stated a growth target to achieve as a way of signalling how well China is doing.But clearly this time it's different: no target - so there's no getting away from the fact that the current economic environment is the most challenging China has faced in recent years. Indeed, China has been through difficult economic periods before - the 1990s, for instance, saw huge numbers of people laid off. The economy at the time was dominated by state-owned enterprises - they provided jobs for the bulk of the working population. As the economy slowed down, they shed millions of workers - and unemployment rose rapidly, by one percentage point every year according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. State-owned enterprises went from employing 60% of the working population in 1995 to 30% in 2002. But China recovered, and the private sector stepped in to hire young people.This time, it's different and the private sector is also under pressure, says economist George Magnus, associate at the China Centre, Oxford University. ""No one was talking about trade wars at that time. The great offshoring of manufacturing to China was underway. ""Now, the rest of the world is an economic funk - so there's no consumer demand, and nothing in terms of foreign trade. All of the headwinds that China was facing before the pandemic have been compounded by the coronavirus.""For the last 40 years, China's Communist Party has been able to promise a simple contract to its citizens: we'll keep your quality of life improving and you fall in line so that we can keep China on the right path. It is the social contract that China's leader Xi Jinping crystallised as the ""Chinese dream"" when he announced it in 2012. 2020 was meant to be a pivotal part of that grand plan - the year China would eliminate absolute poverty, raising the quality and standard of life for millions of people. But the coronavirus could be putting that social contract at risk. Arguably more than any other economic crisis in the Chinese Communist Party's history, this health crisis has become a major threat for social stability in the country. Millions of young people may not be guaranteed the same degree of success that their parents' generation has seen. Keeping that contract of wealth, employment and stability is key to the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy. Which is why economic recovery for China is so critical - and not having a growth target gives the government much needed flexibility to work out a plan. ",22 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Flexible working will be a new normal after virus,"Facebook and New Zealand's Prime Minister are the latest supporters of flexible working as companies mull back-to-office strategies.On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shift towards a more remote workforce as a long-term trend.New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern this week suggested a four-day working week, partly to boost tourism in the country.As offices gradually re-open after coronavirus lockdown, more employers are looking at new ways of working.Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told staff it was ""aggressively opening up remote hiring"" in July. He expects half of its workforce to do their jobs outside Facebook's offices over the next five to 10 years.It follows moves by other tech firms in Silicon Valley, including Twitter, which said employees can work from home ""forever"" if they wish.  Flexible working policies suit staff who are anxious about returning to offices while giving breathing space to companies as they introduce new social distancing measures.Ms Ardern has suggested a four-day working week to help boost the economy and address work-life balancing. ""I hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day work week. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees. But as I've said there's just so much we've learnt about Covid and that flexibility of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that,"" Ardern said in a Facebook live video.Tech giant Microsoft trialled a four-day working week last year in Japan which was deemed successful in terms of employee feedback and productivity. It says it now has a ""hybrid workplace strategy as worksites slowly start to open"". ""Working from home remains optional through October for most employees,"" said a Microsoft spokesperson.Both working from home and shorter working weeks have been applauded by human resources experts as an alternative to a mass return to offices.""It would also give better work-life balance for the people who need it such as part-time students, new mothers, parents who want more time with kids [or] looking after the elderly,"" said Alin Abraham, a Singapore-based consultant.""If after Covid-19 employers learn how to employ flexible workers that would be a huge battle won for human resource management,"" she added.

Amazon trials online food delivery in India,"Internet giant Amazon is entering the meal delivery business with a trial in four parts of India's Bengaluru.The move comes as pandemic lockdowns prompt a surge in online ordering in some places, such as the US.However in India, the two big players in the market have seen significant declines in demand.Uber Eats retreated from the country last year, selling its business to local rival Zomato in exchange for a 10% stake in the Indian start-up.Amazon has set ambitious plans for expansion in India, where it has invested some $6.5bn. Like rival Walmart, it sees significant growth potential in the fast-growing country.It had reportedly planned to launch the food business before the lockdown, but delayed after lockdowns and restrictions on sales of non-essential items came into effect.About 100 restaurants and kitchens are currently involved in the trial in Bengaluru, a tech hub in the southern part of the country. Depending on its success, Amazon hopes to offer the service across the country.""Customers have been telling us for some time that they would like to order prepared meals on Amazon in addition to shopping for other essentials,"" the firm said in a statement. ""This is particularly relevant in present times as they stay home safe. we also recognise that local businesses need all the help they can get.""Amazon, which has grown from an online bookseller into a global juggernaut with a hand in everything from groceries to cloud computing, will be challenging homegrown players Swiggy and Zomato, which currently dominate the food delivery market. They have both been hit hard by loss of business due to the pandemic.Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal this month announced that the firm, which has been expanding outside of India, would cut 13% of its workforce.In a blog post, he said as much as 40% of restaurants could close over the next six to 12 months, a sign that many of the changes ushered in by the pandemic would be permanent.""We do not foresee having enough work for all our employees,"" he said.",21 May 2020,business

They recommend wearing face masks, physical distancing of 1.5m where possible in airports and washing hands often.They stopped short of calling for social distancing on planes due to the confined space, but added that other measures should be followed at all times.Meanwhile, Heathrow Airport will start using thermal cameras to carry out temperature checks in a trial on some passengers from its Terminal 2 on Thursday.Its chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, told the BBC's Today programme that this measure was already being used in many countries around the world.

Facebook's Zuckerberg defends actions on virus misinformation,"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has told the BBC that it had and would remove any content likely to result in ""immediate and imminent harm"" to users. ""Even if something isn't going to lead to imminent physical harm, we don't want misinformation to be the content that is going viral,"" he said. It removed Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's claim that scientists had ""proved"" there was a coronavirus cure.This was removed because it was ""obviously"" not true, he said. He also said that Facebook had removed content from groups claiming that the rollout of the 5G digital network was a cause of the spread of the virus and in some cases encouraged those who believed that to damage the networks physical infrastructure. Facebook recently removed content from former broadcaster and conspiracy theorist David Icke for ""repeatedly violating our policies on harmful misinformation"". Mr Icke had suggested that 5G mobile phone networks are linked to the spread of the virus and in another video he suggested a Jewish group was behind the virus.Mr Zuckerberg said: ""We work with independent fact checkers. Since the Covid outbreak, they have issued 7,500 notices of misinformation which has led to us issuing 50 million warning labels on posts. ""We know these are effective because 95% of the time, users don't click through to the content with a warning label.""However, Facebook has insisted that unless there was the prospect of real imminent harm, then the company would and should allow what he called the ""widest possible aperture"" for freedom of expression on the internet.He also told the BBC that preventing electoral interference is an ""arms race"" against countries such as Russia, Iran and China.He admitted that the firm was ""behind"" in the 2016 US presidential election.In his first UK broadcast interview in five years, he said that Facebook had been unprepared for state-sponsored interference in 2016.But he added the company was confident it had since learnt its lessons.Facebook was previously embroiled in a political scandal in which tens of millions of its users' data ended up in the hands of political interest groups including Cambridge Analytica.However, he said the social media giant, which also owns Whatsapp and Instagram, was now better prepared than other companies, and even governments, to prevent future attempts to influence political outcomes.""Countries are going to continue to try and interfere and we are going to see issues like that but we have learnt a lot since 2016 and I feel pretty confident that we are going to be able to protect the integrity of the upcoming election"".Mr Zuckerberg also defended his level of personal control over arguably the world's most powerful media platforms.Although Facebook is a public company worth nearly $700bn (£574bn), he ultimately exerts total individual control thanks to an ownership structure that gives him a controlling interest even though he owns a small fraction of the shares.He said it had allowed Facebook to make longer-term strategic decisions which have proved to be correct such as waiting to improve the Facebook experience before launching it on smartphones and not selling out early to rivals.""If it had been different then we would have sold out to Yahoo years ago and who knows what would have happened then. ""Yahoo is now worth 1/20th as much as Facebook.Facebook continues to face criticism over its reluctance to describe or define itself as a publisher and thus embrace the kind of editorial responsibility that newspapers and traditional broadcasters are legally bound by.However, it would be hard to argue that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have not provided billions of people with the kind of connectivity with friends and family that has been important during this global pandemic and the consequent restrictions on movement and freedom.In fact, after many years of courting controversy and opprobrium, it seems clear that Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg are feeling more confident about their public roles.If there are any winners out of this public health emergency, digital companies like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon are among them.However, no one is totally immune to the deep downturn that is already upon us and the evidence for which is confirmed with every new economic release.Facebook knows that and is one of the reasons it is keen to help small businesses online through this week's launch of a service called Facebook Shops.It's a mutually beneficial exchange. Those businesses are Facebook's current and future customers. What's good for them is good for Facebook.",21 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: AstraZeneca ready to supply potential vaccine in September,"Drugs giant AstraZeneca has announced it is ready to provide a potential new coronavirus vaccine from September.The firm said it had concluded deals to deliver at least 400 million doses of the vaccine, which it is developing with Oxford University.AstraZeneca said it was capable of producing one billion doses of the AZD1222 vaccine this year and next.Initial trials are under way and AstraZeneca said it recognised that the vaccine might not work.But the company said it was committed to advancing the clinical programme.Scientists have warned that a coronavirus vaccine, if developed, might not confer full immunity, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that a vaccine might never be found.Despite these reservations, intensive research continues, with about 80 groups around the world working on possible vaccines.AstraZeneca indicated that production would take place in more than one country. It thanked the UK and US governments for ""substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine"".It also said it was in discussions with the Serum Institute of India and other potential partners to increase production and distribution.Specifically, it said it had received support of more than $1bn from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine,AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot described the coronavirus pandemic as ""a global tragedy"" and ""a challenge for all of humanity"".

Coronavirus: Universities fear fall in lucrative overseas students,"Which sector of the economy do you think is being hardest hit by the coronavirus - construction, retail, transport or catering?Well, you are all wrong, and need to do some more homework. The answer is - education.Many people probably don't even think of education as part of the economy. The groves of academe are surely above such sordid considerations as money and finance?Not a bit of it. Money is the lifeblood of education - endowments from wealthy alumni, catering and accommodation fees, conference facilities, and the biggest of the lot - attracting lots of fee-paying students every year. The trouble for the education sector is that it is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic.For hundreds of years its business model has been to bring thousands of people together from across the country, and around the world, to sit together in rooms for three years and talk to each other.As a result, nearly all its income streams are under attack at the same time.Current students have been sent home, and many courses have moved online. If lockdowns around the world continue, new students are going to be hard to find in the autumn, and even harder to get on campus.Plus, conferences are not happening, and all those wealthy alumni are nowhere near as wealthy as they thought they were.This hits Western English-speaking universities particularly hard. They tend to charge even domestic students large tuition fees, and make money out of on-site catering and accommodation on top of that.They also tend to charge foreign students a lot more, making them a huge source of income for many universities. In the UK, for example, undergraduate students from outside the UK and the EU can be charged annual tuition fees as high as £58,600 instead of the standard £9,000.So, while globalisation for many means importing cheaper manufactured goods from around the world, for developed economies one of their greatest recent economic successes has been attracting students from overseas.The rise of the middle classes around the world has been a godsend for Western universities, says Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at the University of Oxford.""The global middle classes have grown by leaps and bounds in recent decades, and anyone in that group can send their children abroad for education,"" he says.They have been doing just that, not least because many developing countries don't have the same quality of tertiary education as developed ones. This means that students who study abroad emerge with a prestigious degree, a second language, and lots of contacts and friends. It has proved a price worth paying for millions.The big winners in this regard have been the US, the UK and Australia. All with excellent education systems that teach in English, they can attract fee paying students from around the world.In the US, 360,000 Chinese students started the last academic year. The influx of foreign students is estimated to be worth as much as $45bn (£37bn) a year to the American economy.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:In Australia, foreign students are said to bring in more than 30bn Australian dollars a year ($20bn; £16bn), and it is a market that Australian universities have been targeting for years.Andrew Norton, professor of the practice of higher education policy at Australian National University in Canberra, says the country has been trying to attract foreign students from Asia since the 1980s.Australia has some distinct advantages for these students, he says. ""We are in much the same time zone, the climate is attractive, and there is the possibility of migrating here.""But the government in Canberra has not helped the sector very much, if at all, during this crisis. Prime Minister Scott Morrison even went as far as saying that foreign students should consider going back to their home countries if they could not support themselves during the lockdown.That message is hardly likely to encourage new students to feel welcome in future, and that matters, says Prof Norton, because ""there is a pipeline effect"".""If students don't start a degree course this year, then they are not here for three years,"" he says, meaning universities are going to be feeling the pressure of lost income for years to come, and not only in Australia.In the US the university sector is a massive business. Some of the oldest and most famous colleges have billions in reserve, massive endowments, and a reputation that means they can charge students top dollar. But even they are suffering being closed now.Many overseas students in the US are demanding rebates for lost lessons, and American universities make a small fortune from having students on site. Catering and accommodation are huge earners. Students in the UK have also been calling for refunds.Vijay Govindarajan, Coxe distinguished professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, says: ""I don't see how we can reopen and have campus classes this fall [autumn]"".Professor Marginson says that while universities have rushed to move courses online, at least temporarily, it is clear that they are not as attractive. ""Students, if given the choice, pick face-to-face teaching,"" he says. ""Online does not have the same prestige, and not just with employers, but with society as well.""In the UK, Cambridge University has announced that all its lectures will be online-only during the next academic year. However, it said it would review the situation if government guidance changed.  Colleges and universities around the world have moved rapidly towards online and remote teaching now, because they have to. When much of the world is in lockdown and social distancing is the norm, they have no choice, and it is the only way of keeping at least some money coming in.But it is not clear how many universities will survive the collapse of their income, and whether the move online will become permanent. Teaching people together on one site has proved to be a very long-lasting and successful business model, and it still carries huge prestige and rewards for those taking part.",21 May 2020,business
Oil collapse: 'Right now everything I have is shut down',"The US rose over the last decade to become the world's largest oil producer. Does the pandemic spell the industry's decline?Texas oilman Allan P Bloxsom III still remembers the taunts of ""college boy"" that greeted him on the offshore drilling rig where his father, desperate for his wayward son to shape up, sent him to work one summer.""Against my wishes I went and it changed my life,"" says Mr Bloxsom, now 63 years old and the president of Fort Apache Energy, a small company that operates oil and gas wells in Texas and Louisiana. ""I was hooked.""That was decades ago. Since then, his home state of Texas has more than doubled its crude oil output, helping to turn the US into the world's biggest oil producer.But as oil prices tumble - briefly falling below zero in a first last month - following a dramatic drop in energy demand because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the industry is going into reverse.Giants such as Exxon and Chevron and fracking firms such as Diamondback Energy have shut in wells and slashed investment in recent weeks, helping drive down US crude oil production by nearly one million barrels per day from March to April - the third largest monthly decline in a century.Mr Bloxsom cut his typical output of 800 barrels per day by more than half. Others have gone even further.""Right now everything I have is shut down. Everything,"" says Bill D Graham, president of Midland, Texas-based Incline Energy, which has 80 wells that in more typical times would about 275 barrels per day. The supply cuts are not unique to the US. The International Energy Agency expects global oil supply to fall to a nine-year low this month, as producers around the world reduce output in response to prices that dropped by more than two-thirds in April before starting to stabilise.But even before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the industry was experiencing a supply glut - driven by the US boom - that had depressed prices and prompted strains in oil-producing Texas and elsewhere. The Wall Street money that helped power the fracking growth had grown harder to come by, while big firms were promoting investments in renewable energy. Forecasters at IHS Markit say supply is unlikely to return to 2019 levels until at least 2023. There is a chance that 2019 will have been the high point for global output, should the pandemic permanently reduce energy demand - for example, by increasing telework and reducing business travel.""This is a transformational crisis for the world and what happens to oil will be shaped by the broader forces of change that are coming out of Covid-19,"" says Jim Burkhard, the firm's head of oil market research.""There's enough of these variables in play where you don't have to have a doomsday view of the world to consider that oil demand could have peaked in 2019. That's not our base case, but it is our alternative scenario.""In the US, several large US companies have already filed for bankruptcy, with more expected in a sector where debt levels were already dangerously high. Services firms, desperate to survive the crisis, have cut more than 66,000 jobs - almost 10% of total employment - with more reductions likely, the Petroleum Equipment & Services Association industry group estimates. As healthier businesses scoop up the assets of distressed rivals, the industry is likely to emerge with fewer firms and fewer workers.""The future for the small operator like me - I see it going away completely,"" says Mr Graham.Mr Graham, whose father started Incline Energy in 1966, says he managed to keep his five staff after securing government coronavirus rescue money. But if the price his oil fetches - which for now is lower than figure traded on financial markets - does not bounce back above $25 by October, those jobs are at risk.""With the wells shut in and zero income, we're just going to have to play a waiting game and see how long we can last,"" the 66-year-old says.US President Donald Trump has pledged his support for the oil industry and opened government storage facilities, so that producers do not have to sell at a loss due to lack of storage as happened in April. The Federal Reserve has also adjusted its coronavirus relief programmes to make sure energy firms qualify. But Democrats, backed by environmental groups and others concerned about fossil fuel contributions to climate change, have resisted greater assistance for the sector, pointing to already high debt levels among many firms. ""It is deplorable to send good money after bad,"" Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, wrote after the Fed's changes.Leslie Beyer, president of industry group Petroleum Equipment & Services Association, says many of her members are already working on renewables and cleaner energy technology. She calls those who hope the pandemic will spell the demise of the industry ""misguided"", noting that global population growth and economic development in poor countries will drive continuing demand for oil.""Some people who don't understand the way the industry works ... think now is the time to transition entirely to renewables. There is definitely room for renewables and we need to increase those, but we don't go zero to 60,"" she says. ""It's important that we don't give up on the ingenuity that created the shale boom. That's what put us in the great position that we're in as the world's largest producer ... We need to maintain that.""But the best days of the industry may be over, Mr Bloxsom says, pointing to the scarcity of young people at conferences.""I have told all four of my kids, 'Do not go into the oil patch,"" he says. ""Do something else.""",20 May 2020,business
Dark web scammers exploit Covid-19 fear and doubt,"""They're exploiting the fear, uncertainty and doubt people are experiencing during the pandemic, and using the anxiety and desperation to get people to buy things or click on things they wouldn't have otherwise,"" says Morgan Wright, a former senior adviser to the US Department of State anti-terrorism assistance programme.He's talking about the scammers and criminals that inhabit the ""dark web"" who have found a new angle - anxiety over Covid-19.Mr Wright, who is now chief security adviser at security software company SentinelOne, used to teach behavioural analysts at the US National Security Agency (NSA) about the exploitation of human behaviour. He is now seeing some of those techniques being used on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet that can be accessed using popular networks such as Tor.The Tor browser is privacy-focused, meaning it can obscure who is using it and what data is being accessed. It offers bad actors a way to operate with a degree of impunity, as law enforcement find it much more difficult to track down criminals that use it.Tor is a way to access the internet that requires software, known as the Tor browser, to use it.The name is an acronym for The Onion Router. Just as there are many layers to the vegetable, there are many layers of encryption on the network.It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and continues to receive funding from the US State Department.It attempts to hide a person's location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several ""nodes"" - which, in this context, means using volunteers' PCs and computer servers as connection points.Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity.To the website that ultimately receives the request, it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain - known as an ""exit node"" - rather than the person responsible.Since the beginning of the global pandemic, marketplaces on the dark web have seen a rise in Covid-19 related products and services. Sought-after N95 masks, gowns, gloves and the drug chloroquine have all been listed on these marketplaces. Last month, security software firm IntSights found blood allegedly belonging to recovered coronavirus patients was even being offered for sale. Criminals hope a heightened sense of fear will make people rush to buy these products, and as a result these items are not cheap; an Australian Institute of Criminology report found the average fake vaccine was being sold for about $370 (£300), while one supposedly sourced from China was selling for between $10-15,000 (£8-12,000).One of the reasons for the rise in such sales may be because many fraudsters are having to turn from their normal methods of making money on the dark web - such as selling fake flights booked using stolen airmiles - because these industries are currently dormant. Many criminals also see an opportunity - as the majority of people are working from home, there is a greater chance of lax cyber security in place. ""There was suddenly a huge shift [on the dark web] of talking about vulnerabilities in collaboration software when they realised people were going to be working from home,"" says IntSights chief security officer Etay Maor. More Technology of BusinessPhishing scams have also been on the rise. These are where fraudsters pretend to be a different organisation or person by email, hoping the person will provide some login details or personal data, which can then be used to steal money or someone's identity. ""The phishing attacks started with those pretending to be from the NHS, and then extended to secondary organisations that are related to Covid-19 like banks or HMRC emailing about funding, grants or being furloughed,"" says Javvad Malik, security advocate at training company KnowBe4.""Now there are Covid-19 related phishing templates making their way into all of the phishing kits that are available on the dark web - meaning people can imitate Apple or LinkedIn with a set of standard templates,"" he adds.In addition, many services and products, including phishing kits are being offered at discount in ""coronavirus sales"".""There are people who have been specialising in phishing pages, shady VPNs or spamming services for a number of years, who are now offering discounts because they believe it's the best time to make money and spread these kits,"" says Liv Rowley, threat intelligence analyst at Blueliv, a computer and network security firm.The dark web was designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, with the idea of enabling human rights activists and people within the military to talk and collaborate in a secure, anonymous way. While the introduction of bitcoin enabled criminals to make money on the dark web, there remains a huge number of users that opt to use it for its initial purpose - speaking to others anonymously on forums.According to Mr Malik, these forums have often been used to fuel conspiracy theories around the virus.""Conspiracies about 5G being the vehicle of this virus, or bioweaponry or that Bill Gates is the man behind it tend to crop up on the dark web,"" he says.As social media companies and other news outlets crack down on misinformation, many others may be pushed onto the dark web. These forums often act as a gateway to marketplaces, for people to plug their products or services to a targeted audience. This could be a way for fraudsters to make further money in the months to come. The flipside to this is that many journalists, activists and citizens may be using the dark web to communicate in countries where there is a lot of censorship. Tor versions of many news outlets, including the BBC and New York Times, may be used if the original sites are blocked by governments or states, for instance. Netblocks, a digital rights advocacy group says that many countries have cut access to the web in different ways, as they seek to control the flow of information about the coronavirus outbreak.Two ransomware groups had said they would not attack any hospitals or healthcare organisations during the pandemic, but as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab outlined in a recent press briefing, there is evidence that criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations that are responding to the pandemic - including hospitals.""These organisations are targeted because of how vulnerable they are at this time and because of the likelihood that a ransom would be paid,"" says Charity Wright, cyber threat intelligence adviser at IntSights.The co-ordination and orchestration of many of these attacks often begin on the dark web.""We are seeing more offerings on the dark web specifically for healthcare-related information and for targeting healthcare facilities and doctors. There's even a database someone has created on the dark web with all kinds of information about medical staff,"" says Etay Maor from IntSights. At its core, the dark web may still be being used for the same reasons it was intended to be used for - from a privacy and security perspective. But criminals are using this to try to exploit a global crisis for financial gain.""That's the double-edged sword that as a society we haven't quite worked out: how do we safeguard freedom of speech and ensure privacy, but at the same time track down and stop people abusing those freedoms?"" says Javvad Malik.

What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

China scraps annual economic growth target for first time,"China will not set an economic growth goal for this year as it deals with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.It is the first time Beijing has not had a gross domestic product (GDP) target since 1990 when records began.The announcement was made by Premier Li Keqiang at the start of the country's annual parliament meeting.The world's second largest economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter from a year ago as lockdowns paralysed businesses.“This is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,” Premier Li said.The country's leadership has promised to boost economic support measures amid growing concerns that rising unemployment could threaten social stability.The move comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington are becoming increasingly strained over the coronavirus pandemic, trade and Hong Kong.On Thursday, President Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on China, suggesting that the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, is behind a “disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.”It came as Mr Trump and other Republicans have escalated their criticism of Beijing's handling of the early stages of the outbreak. Also on Thursday, China announced plans to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong after last year’s pro-democracy protests.The announcement was met with a warning from Mr Trump that the US would react “very strongly” against any attempt to gain more control over the former British colony.Separately, two US senators have proposed legislation to punish Chinese entities involved in enforcing the planned new laws and penalise banks that do business with them.Earlier this week, the US Senate unanimously passed a proposal to delist Chinese companies from American stock exchanges if they fail to comply with US financial reporting standards.US-listed Chinese companies have come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.",22 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Flexible working will be a new normal after virus,"Facebook and New Zealand's Prime Minister are the latest supporters of flexible working as companies mull back-to-office strategies.On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shift towards a more remote workforce as a long-term trend.New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern this week suggested a four-day working week, partly to boost tourism in the country.As offices gradually re-open after coronavirus lockdown, more employers are looking at new ways of working.Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told staff it was ""aggressively opening up remote hiring"" in July. He expects half of its workforce to do their jobs outside Facebook's offices over the next five to 10 years.It follows moves by other tech firms in Silicon Valley, including Twitter, which said employees can work from home ""forever"" if they wish.  Flexible working policies suit staff who are anxious about returning to offices while giving breathing space to companies as they introduce new social distancing measures.Ms Ardern has suggested a four-day working week to help boost the economy and address work-life balancing. ""I hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day work week. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees. But as I've said there's just so much we've learnt about Covid and that flexibility of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that,"" Ardern said in a Facebook live video.Tech giant Microsoft trialled a four-day working week last year in Japan which was deemed successful in terms of employee feedback and productivity. It says it now has a ""hybrid workplace strategy as worksites slowly start to open"". ""Working from home remains optional through October for most employees,"" said a Microsoft spokesperson.Both working from home and shorter working weeks have been applauded by human resources experts as an alternative to a mass return to offices.""It would also give better work-life balance for the people who need it such as part-time students, new mothers, parents who want more time with kids [or] looking after the elderly,"" said Alin Abraham, a Singapore-based consultant.""If after Covid-19 employers learn how to employ flexible workers that would be a huge battle won for human resource management,"" she added. A shift towards more remote working also allows companies to rethink their expensive office space. Mastercard said it is currently looking at consolidating some of its offices while Facebook has plans for working ""hubs"" across the US.""Post Covid-19, you can imagine many companies shrinking down their real estate and employees can just work from home. It will be an interesting proposition to see how employers can cater to different crowds,"" said Adrian Tan, of workplace IT firm PeopleStrong.A growing list of business leaders are adding their weight to working from home and more flexible working arrangements, aided by technology and video-conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet.""As we start to return to workplaces and find a new normal, alternative working patterns will also help reduce commuter traffic and with social distancing measures,"" said HR consultant Emily Draycott-Jones. ""Covid has made employers move away from traditional thinking that productivity is contingent upon set hours within an office environment,"" she added.The big tech giants dominate when it comes to extending flexible work arrangements over a longer term:",22 May 2020,business
WageDay Advance: Tiny payout for borrowers mis-sold payday loans,"Borrowers mis-sold payday loans by a lender which later collapsed will receive less than 6% of the compensation they are owed.WageDay Advance went into administration in February last year, after being flooded by claims.In a case that mirrors that of Wonga, some 100,000 borrowers will receive 5.68% of their compensation entitlement, administrators say.One of those receiving the payment said she was annoyed but not surprised.Marie Ellis got into a spiral of debt after taking payday loans from WageDay Advance, Wonga and others to pay for day-to-day living costs.She worked in film and TV marketing, which she described as ""exciting, but low-paid"".Extra one-off costs meant she took on multiple and increasingly large loans.""I was an adult and working to a budget, but the debt can snowball,"" said Ms Ellis, who wrote a blog about her experiences.Borrowers who were mis-sold a payday loan, because affordability checks had not been carried out properly, are entitled to redress.This is made up of a refund of interest and charges they paid, as well as additional 8% of compensation.Ms Ellis made a claim to WageDay Advance for being sold loans that were unaffordable, and was told she was entitled to £1,727 in compensation.Now, following the final confirmation of payouts by the administrators, she will only receive £98.""So many people got into such a mess. Generally, we feel annoyed about it,"" she said.""It is nice to have received something. We are a bit disgruntled, but you have to accept the situation.""She has now worked to become debt-free.WageDay Advance and Juo Loans were the brand names of CURO Transatlantic Limited.It had been one of the middle-ranking payday lenders operating in the UK, with most customers applying for loans online or through their smartphones from WageDay.In 2017, it won an industry award when it was named the best short-term loan provider.But, like others in the industry, many loans had been mis-sold to people who could not afford to pay them back, had loans rolled over, or had multiple loans with other providers. Following its collapse, some 256,000 customers owed compensation were sent emails inviting them to claim. About 100,000 did so.They will now get less than six pence in the pound of their entitlement, but the payment should be made into their bank account within the next seven days.Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes the Debt Camel blog, is among those calling for a wider safety net to protect people who find themselves in similar situation.""Wageday Advance customers have been let down twice by the UK regulators. First Wageday Advance was allowed to carry on giving loans without proper affordability checks for years,"" she said.""Now they will receive less than 6% of the refund they should have had. The FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] should extend the Financial Services Compensation Scheme so it helps customers in this situation get their full compensation.""About 60,000 of WageDay's loans - almost entirely more recent loans without any compensation entitlement - were sold off to Shelby Finance Limited.",21 May 2020,business
Facebook's Zuckerberg defends actions on virus misinformation,"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has told the BBC that it had and would remove any content likely to result in ""immediate and imminent harm"" to users. ""Even if something isn't going to lead to imminent physical harm, we don't want misinformation to be the content that is going viral,"" he said. It removed Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's claim that scientists had ""proved"" there was a coronavirus cure.This was removed because it was ""obviously"" not true, he said. He also said that Facebook had removed content from groups claiming that the rollout of the 5G digital network was a cause of the spread of the virus and in some cases encouraged those who believed that to damage the networks physical infrastructure. Facebook recently removed content from former broadcaster and conspiracy theorist David Icke for ""repeatedly violating our policies on harmful misinformation"". Mr Icke had suggested that 5G mobile phone networks are linked to the spread of the virus and in another video he suggested a Jewish group was behind the virus.Mr Zuckerberg said: ""We work with independent fact checkers. Since the Covid outbreak, they have issued 7,500 notices of misinformation which has led to us issuing 50 million warning labels on posts. ""We know these are effective because 95% of the time, users don't click through to the content with a warning label.""However, Facebook has insisted that unless there was the prospect of real imminent harm, then the company would and should allow what he called the ""widest possible aperture"" for freedom of expression on the internet.He also told the BBC that preventing electoral interference is an ""arms race"" against countries such as Russia, Iran and China.He admitted that the firm was ""behind"" in the 2016 US presidential election.In his first UK broadcast interview in five years, he said that Facebook had been unprepared for state-sponsored interference in 2016.But he added the company was confident it had since learnt its lessons.Facebook was previously embroiled in a political scandal in which tens of millions of its users' data ended up in the hands of political interest groups including Cambridge Analytica.However, he said the social media giant, which also owns Whatsapp and Instagram, was now better prepared than other companies, and even governments, to prevent future attempts to influence political outcomes.""Countries are going to continue to try and interfere and we are going to see issues like that but we have learnt a lot since 2016 and I feel pretty confident that we are going to be able to protect the integrity of the upcoming election"".Mr Zuckerberg also defended his level of personal control over arguably the world's most powerful media platforms.Although Facebook is a public company worth nearly $700bn (£574bn), he ultimately exerts total individual control thanks to an ownership structure that gives him a controlling interest even though he owns a small fraction of the shares.He said it had allowed Facebook to make longer-term strategic decisions which have proved to be correct such as waiting to improve the Facebook experience before launching it on smartphones and not selling out early to rivals.""If it had been different then we would have sold out to Yahoo years ago and who knows what would have happened then. ""Yahoo is now worth 1/20th as much as Facebook.Facebook continues to face criticism over its reluctance to describe or define itself as a publisher and thus embrace the kind of editorial responsibility that newspapers and traditional broadcasters are legally bound by.However, it would be hard to argue that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have not provided billions of people with the kind of connectivity with friends and family that has been important during this global pandemic and the consequent restrictions on movement and freedom.In fact, after many years of courting controversy and opprobrium, it seems clear that Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg are feeling more confident about their public roles.If there are any winners out of this public health emergency, digital companies like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon are among them.However, no one is totally immune to the deep downturn that is already upon us and the evidence for which is confirmed with every new economic release.Facebook knows that and is one of the reasons it is keen to help small businesses online through this week's launch of a service called Facebook Shops.It's a mutually beneficial exchange. Those businesses are Facebook's current and future customers. What's good for them is good for Facebook.",21 May 2020,business
Mastercard staff can work from home 'until ready',"Mastercard staff can continue working from home until they ""feel comfortable"" going to the office amid the pandemic.The credit card firm employs about 20,000 people globally, with a ""large percentage"" now working from home.Rather than forcing them back to offices, staff can make their own decision on timings, it said.Twitter said last week it would allow staff to work from home ""forever"" as a growing number of firms rethink work arrangements.""Today, a large percentage of our team is working remotely, even as most offices remain open,"" a Mastercard spokesman said.""At the end of the day, our employees will make the decision on when they feel comfortable returning to an office. They know their personal circumstances and needs"". Tech giants Facebook and Google have also relaxed back-to-office policies and say they will let employees to continue working from home for the rest of the year. While about 90% of Mastercard's employees are working from home, this may go down once there is adequate testing and a vaccine is found, it said. In an interview with the BBC's Asia Business Report, Mastercard's chief executive Ajay Banga said he thought that was still ""some time away"". ""I'm not planning on getting back to a pre-Covid growth scenario for another year. I think that could be sometime next year when a vaccine is readily available and readily distributed.""Mastercard said it was also looking at consolidating some of its offices. It has created a ""future of work"" task force that is figuring out how best to handle employee needs and real estate amid the coronavirus crisis. The company has its headquarters New York, but also has regional hubs in Dubai, Singapore and Brussels.UK bank Barclays has also questioned the need for having thousands of its workers in big and expensive city offices. This ""may be a thing of the past"", its chief executive Jes Staley said last month.About 70,000 of Barclays' staff worldwide are working from home due to coronavirus lockdown measures which has led to a rethink of the bank's long-term ""location strategy"", Mr Staley said.Mastercard employees who work in its offices must now follow social distancing rules, wear face masks and undergo temperature checks.""One day, I think probably aided by a vaccine, and the ability therefore for the workers and consumers to get the confidence they need, we can get back to thinking about a pre-Covid kind of growth stage,"" said Mr Banga.  ""I still think that's some time away.""",21 May 2020,business
US Senate passes bill that could delist some Chinese firms,"The US Senate has passed a bill that could block some Chinese companies from selling shares on American stock exchanges.It would require overseas firms to follow US standards for audits and other financial regulations.The measure now has to be passed by the House of Representatives before being signed into law by President Trump.It comes as US-China tensions increase over the virus pandemic and after the Luckin Coffee accounting scandal.The planned legislation would also require publicly traded companies to reveal whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.The bill applies to all foreign companies, but is targeted at China, and follows intense criticism of Beijing by Mr Trump and other US politicians.Mr Trump and officials in his administration argue that China mishandled the coronavirus outbreak in its early stages.The outbreak has now grown to become a pandemic that has killed almost 330,000 people worldwide and crippled the global economy.US-listed Chinese companies have already come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.The company said its own investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of last year to the fourth quarter amounted to about 2.2bn yuan ($310m; £254m). That equates to about 40% of its estimated annual sales.The Chinese coffee chain has since sacked its chief executive and chief operating officer, while six other employees who were alleged to have been involved in or known about the transactions have been suspended or put on leave.The scandal-hit firm has said it has been co-operating with regulators in the US and China, who have begun an investigation into the company.Luckin's Nasdaq listing had been one of China's few successful US stock market debuts of 2019.On Tuesday Luckin said the Nasdaq exchange had notified the company of plans to delist it due to concerns over the alleged fabricated sales and disclosure failures. Its shares will trade on the exchange pending the outcome of an appeal, expected within 45 days.The scandal-hit firm's shares, which had been suspended since 7 April, plunged by more than 35% after they resumed trading on Wednesday.",21 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Universities fear fall in lucrative overseas students,"Which sector of the economy do you think is being hardest hit by the coronavirus - construction, retail, transport or catering?Well, you are all wrong, and need to do some more homework. The answer is - education.Many people probably don't even think of education as part of the economy. The groves of academe are surely above such sordid considerations as money and finance?Not a bit of it. Money is the lifeblood of education - endowments from wealthy alumni, catering and accommodation fees, conference facilities, and the biggest of the lot - attracting lots of fee-paying students every year. The trouble for the education sector is that it is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic.For hundreds of years its business model has been to bring thousands of people together from across the country, and around the world, to sit together in rooms for three years and talk to each other.As a result, nearly all its income streams are under attack at the same time.Current students have been sent home, and many courses have moved online. If lockdowns around the world continue, new students are going to be hard to find in the autumn, and even harder to get on campus.Plus, conferences are not happening, and all those wealthy alumni are nowhere near as wealthy as they thought they were.This hits Western English-speaking universities particularly hard. They tend to charge even domestic students large tuition fees, and make money out of on-site catering and accommodation on top of that.They also tend to charge foreign students a lot more, making them a huge source of income for many universities. In the UK, for example, undergraduate students from outside the UK and the EU can be charged annual tuition fees as high as £58,600 instead of the standard £9,000.So, while globalisation for many means importing cheaper manufactured goods from around the world, for developed economies one of their greatest recent economic successes has been attracting students from overseas.The rise of the middle classes around the world has been a godsend for Western universities, says Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at the University of Oxford.""The global middle classes have grown by leaps and bounds in recent decades, and anyone in that group can send their children abroad for education,"" he says.They have been doing just that, not least because many developing countries don't have the same quality of tertiary education as developed ones. This means that students who study abroad emerge with a prestigious degree, a second language, and lots of contacts and friends. It has proved a price worth paying for millions.The big winners in this regard have been the US, the UK and Australia. All with excellent education systems that teach in English, they can attract fee paying students from around the world.In the US, 360,000 Chinese students started the last academic year. The influx of foreign students is estimated to be worth as much as $45bn (£37bn) a year to the American economy.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:In Australia, foreign students are said to bring in more than 30bn Australian dollars a year ($20bn; £16bn), and it is a market that Australian universities have been targeting for years.Andrew Norton, professor of the practice of higher education policy at Australian National University in Canberra, says the country has been trying to attract foreign students from Asia since the 1980s.Australia has some distinct advantages for these students, he says. ""We are in much the same time zone, the climate is attractive, and there is the possibility of migrating here.""But the government in Canberra has not helped the sector very much, if at all, during this crisis. Prime Minister Scott Morrison even went as far as saying that foreign students should consider going back to their home countries if they could not support themselves during the lockdown.That message is hardly likely to encourage new students to feel welcome in future, and that matters, says Prof Norton, because ""there is a pipeline effect"".""If students don't start a degree course this year, then they are not here for three years,"" he says, meaning universities are going to be feeling the pressure of lost income for years to come, and not only in Australia.In the US the university sector is a massive business. Some of the oldest and most famous colleges have billions in reserve, massive endowments, and a reputation that means they can charge students top dollar. But even they are suffering being closed now.Many overseas students in the US are demanding rebates for lost lessons, and American universities make a small fortune from having students on site. Catering and accommodation are huge earners. Students in the UK have also been calling for refunds.Vijay Govindarajan, Coxe distinguished professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, says: ""I don't see how we can reopen and have campus classes this fall [autumn]"".Professor Marginson says that while universities have rushed to move courses online, at least temporarily, it is clear that they are not as attractive. ""Students, if given the choice, pick face-to-face teaching,"" he says. ""Online does not have the same prestige, and not just with employers, but with society as well.""In the UK, Cambridge University has announced that all its lectures will be online-only during the next academic year. However, it said it would review the situation if government guidance changed.  Colleges and universities around the world have moved rapidly towards online and remote teaching now, because they have to. When much of the world is in lockdown and social distancing is the norm, they have no choice, and it is the only way of keeping at least some money coming in.But it is not clear how many universities will survive the collapse of their income, and whether the move online will become permanent. Teaching people together on one site has proved to be a very long-lasting and successful business model, and it still carries huge prestige and rewards for those taking part.",21 May 2020,business
