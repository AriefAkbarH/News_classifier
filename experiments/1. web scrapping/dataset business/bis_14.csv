Coronavirus: Young could be scarred throughout working life,"The International Labour Organisation has said young people are disproportionately being affected by the coronavirus health crisis.In a new report the ILO, which is a United Nations agency, warns there is a risk they could be scarred throughout their working lives.They could become what the report calls a ""lockdown generation"".It says young women have been especially hit by the increase in unemployment.Young people have been affected by what the report calls ""a triple shock"".The virus, it says, is destroying their employment, disrupting education and training and putting obstacles in the way of those who want to start work or change jobs.One in five have stopped work since the onset of the pandemic.Among those who have remained in employment, working hours have declined by almost a quarter. Before the crisis, more than 40% of young people were working in hard-hit sectors such as accommodation, food services and retailing. Three quarters were in informal employment and therefore had little protection if they do lose their jobs. In Africa, the figure is more than 90%. Education and training, including ""on the job"" programmes are suffering massive disruption, the ILO says. A great deal of training is now being done at a distance, online. But the ILO says few low-income countries have managed to make that transition.  The agency calls for targeted intervention by governments to guarantee employment and training for young people in low and middle-income countries that may need foreign support both for finance and implementation.The report also says that rigorous testing and tracing of infections strongly translates to lower labour market disruption than do confinement and lockdown measures. The ILO argues that testing and tracing improves the chances of what it calls an employment-rich recovery. ",27 May 2020,business
"Record drop in energy investment, warns International Energy Agency","The coronavirus crisis is causing the biggest fall in global energy investment in history. Before the pandemic, funding was set to rise 2%, but now it’s predicted to plunge 20%, says the International Energy Agency (IEA).Fossil fuels are hit hardest, with a 30% funding drop expected for oil and a 15% fall for coal.Renewables investment is down 10% - and it's only about half what’s needed to combat climate change.Due to coronavirus lockdown measures imposed by many countries, for the time being, the fall in investment is leading to a drop in planet-heating carbon emissions.But the IEA warns that that use of fossil fuels is likely to rebound when the crisis is over, leading to a spike in CO2.One reason is because China and other Asian nations are putting in orders now for a new generation of coal-fired power plants to supply energy in the future.“We see a historical decline in emissions, but unless we have the right economic recovery packages, we might see emissions again skyrocket and the decline of this year would be completely wasted,"" the IEA's executive director Fatih Birol told the BBC.“Remember the 2008-2009 crashes. We immediately saw a decline in emissions, but afterwards it rebounded. We must learn from history.”Approvals of new coal plants in the first quarter of 2020, mainly in China, were running at twice the rate observed over the whole of 2019, he added.Overall energy investment has fallen almost $400bn (£324.3bn) short of what was expected in 2020, and the IEA says there are now serious doubts about secure energy supplies when the global economy picks up, because energy projects take so long to deliver.The report says the decline in investment is “staggering” in its scale and swiftness, mostly due to low demand and low prices for energy, especially oil.Dr Birol said: “The historic plunge in investment is deeply troubling. It means lost jobs and economic opportunities today, as well as lost energy supply that we might well need tomorrow, once the economy recovers. “The slowdown in spending also risks undermining the much-needed transition to more sustainable energy systems.” The report says a combination of falling demand, lower prices and a rise in non-payment of bills means energy revenues to governments and industry are set to fall by well over a trillion dollars in 2020. Oil accounts for most of the total of this decline. Shale gas – previously the darling of the energy sector - is anticipated to take the biggest percentage hit overall, with a 50% investment fall.Renewables investment has been more resilient, but spending on rooftop solar installations by has been strongly affected. Energy efficiency is suffering too, as investment is set to fall by an estimated 10-15%.The overall share of global energy spending that goes to clean energy has been stuck at around one-third in recent years.In 2020 it will jump towards 40% of total investment - but that’s only relative, because fossil fuels are taking such a battering.Dr Birol added: “The crisis has brought lower emissions but for all the wrong reasons. If we are to achieve a lasting reduction in global emissions, then we will need to see a rapid increase in clean energy investment.”Decisions to commission new coal-fired plants are down more than 80% since 2015, but the global coal fleet continues to grow.Follow Roger on Twitter.",27 May 2020,business
UK furlough scheme now covers 8.4 million workers,"Some 8.4 million workers are now covered by the government's furlough scheme, up from eight million a week earlier, the Treasury has said.Claims for subsidies filed by employers rose to £15bn from £11.1bn, it added.The scheme, brought in to mitigate the effects of coronavirus, allows employees to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to £2,500.A similar scheme for self-employed workers saw 2.3 million claims made worth £6.8bn.If you have been affected by the furlough scheme, email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.The Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, as it is known, differs from the furlough scheme because it is a grant paid out in a single instalment covering three months and amounting to 80% of average profit.The furlough scheme, officially called the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, was originally intended to last until the end of July, but has now been extended until the end of October.Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed that it will continue to provide the same level of earnings, but has said the government will ask companies to ""start sharing"" the cost of the scheme from August.Sources have told the BBC the Treasury still expects to be paying more than half the costs between August and October.Recent figures from the government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, indicate that the cost of the government's efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic is expected to hit £123.2bn.The OBR expects annual borrowing to equal 15.2% of the UK economy, which would be the highest since the 22.1% seen at the end of World War Two.It said it had increased its estimate because of the rising cost of the furlough scheme.",27 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: France announces €8bn rescue plan for car industry,"The French government has announced an €8bn (£7.1bn) rescue plan for its car industry, which has been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. President Emmanuel Macron's proposal includes €1bn to provide grants of up to €7,000 to encourage citizens to purchase electric vehicles.It also puts money toward investments to make France a centre for electric vehicle output.The plan comes as the industry braces for thousands of job cuts.In return for the relief, the two main French car producers Renault and PSA have promised to focus production in France.""We need a motivational goal - make France Europe's top producer of clean vehicles by bringing output to more than one million electric and hybrid cars per year over the next five years,"" President Macron told reporters at a press conference at the Valeo car factory in Etaples, northern France on Tuesday.He added that no car model currently produced in France should be manufactured in other countries.To help sell the 400,000 vehicles languishing in car dealerships due to the coronavirus lockdown measures, President Macron said the government would also give people upgrading to a less polluting car a €3,000 bonus, as part of a scheme open to 75% of French households.""Our fellow citizens need to buy more vehicles, and in particular clean ones. Not in two, five or 10 years - now,"" he stressed. Like in other countries, France's car industry has ground to a halt - with an 80% fall in sales and a backlog of nearly half a million new vehicles waiting for owners.  President Macron - in his new post-virus spend-and-invest mode - wants to act now not just to rescue the industry from the immediate crisis,  but also to prepare it for a future that will be both electric and he hopes much less dependent on foreign and in particular Chinese suppliers. To boost demand now, the grants for households or companies that buy new electric cars are increased, as is the so-called conversion bonus for trading in a polluting car for a cleaner one.  The number of battery charge-points will be tripled to 100,000 by the end of next year. A billion euros in investment will be directed into research and modernising production, and there'll be a €5bn loan for Renault - part of the return for which is a promise by Renault to join a Franco-German consortium to develop car batteries.  The aim, Mr Macron said, is to have one million electric cars being made in France every year by 2025. According to IHS Markit, France was Europe's top producer of electric and hybrid cars in 2019, with almost 240,000 vehicles, but Germany is set to overtake it by the end of this year. The €8bn plan does not include an expected €5bn loan for embattled French carmaker Renault, which in February reported its first annual loss in a decade.The company has been planning to unveil a big restructuring plan on 29 May that was reportedly likely to see it close three factories in Choisy-le-Roi, Dieppe and Caudan. A fourth factory, Flins, will be converted into an electric battery factory. Mr Macron said on Tuesday that Renault had agreed to join a Franco-German project to produce electric batteries for the rechargeable auto industry, a step the government had set as a condition for the loan.But Mr Macron said the government would not sign off on the deal until Renault's management and unions had concluded talks over the carmaker's French workforce and plants in France.Mr Macron only guaranteed the future for employees of Renault's factories in Mauberge and Douai, however. And French daily national newspaper Le Figaro reported exclusively on Tuesday that Renault is planning to cut 5,000 jobs by 2024.The 370 employees that work at the Fonderie de Bretagne, near Lorient in north-western France, are concerned that the carmaker intends to close the factory. They have been protesting since Monday, blockading the factory, and told French national radio network Europe 1 that they intend to march on the streets of Lorient on Wednesday.",26 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: 'Short-lived' rebound in house hunter demand,"Demand from property hunters rebounded as curbs on the sector were lifted in England - but the trend may be short-lived, analysis suggests.Buyer demand rose by 88% in the week estate agents were told they could resume viewings and people could move again, property portal Zoopla said.However, actual sales remained sluggish, and the analysis suggests demand could fall again. A tough outlook for jobs could affect people's ability to move home.For those who do still have the money to move, Zoopla echoed others in suggesting residents may have spent lockdown rethinking what they want from their home.Another property portal, Rightmove, reported a return to pre-crisis levels of browsing and enquiries from people looking to buy a home at the point restrictions were lifted in England on 13 May.Now, Zoopla's UK Cities House Price Index has said that the rebound in demand went beyond the level seen at the start of March. Portsmouth, Southampton, Oxford, Liverpool and Manchester all saw demand rise.This trend was far more muted where the restrictions remained - in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland - and also in London, where the market had already been relatively slow.The analysis found the rebound would be temporary, after people who had been stuck at home and thinking of moving met with the realities of less settled job prospects.""Many households are likely to have re-evaluated what they want from their home. This could well explain the scale of the demand returning to the market,"" said Richard Donnell, director of research at Zoopla. He said economic uncertainty was building and that would eventually lead to greater caution among buyers and sellers.A small survey, as part of the research, found that 41% of those asked had put moving plans on hold owing to the uncertainty, loss of income, or future prospects for their finances.Lockdown had meant thousands of people put house sales on hold.Residential property sales in the UK in April hit their lowest monthly level since comparable records began in 2005, with 38,060 transactions during the month, according to provisional numbers from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).This was less than half the level seen in the same month the previous year.Great uncertainty remains over the level of recovery in sales, as well as prices.Meanwhile, Rightmove said that, in the week after restrictions in England were lifted, interest from those looking to move in the private rental sector had increased ahead of the level seen at the same time last year.Monday 18 May saw its highest level of rental demand in a single day.The biggest increases in rental searches compared with a year ago were in Rotherham, Cambridge and St Helens, it said.""A week's worth of data should only be taken as an early indication of activity, but it's certainly encouraging,"" said Miles Shipside, from Rightmove.",27 May 2020,business

President Macron - in his new post-virus spend-and-invest mode - wants to act now not just to rescue the industry from the immediate crisis,  but also to prepare it for a future that will be both electric and he hopes much less dependent on foreign and in particular Chinese suppliers. To boost demand now, the grants for households or companies that buy new electric cars are increased, as is the so-called conversion bonus for trading in a polluting car for a cleaner one.  The number of battery charge-points will be tripled to 100,000 by the end of next year. A billion euros in investment will be directed into research and modernising production, and there'll be a €5bn loan for Renault - part of the return for which is a promise by Renault to join a Franco-German consortium to develop car batteries.  The aim, Mr Macron said, is to have one million electric cars being made in France every year by 2025. According to IHS Markit, France was Europe's top producer of electric and hybrid cars in 2019, with almost 240,000 vehicles, but Germany is set to overtake it by the end of this year. The €8bn plan does not include an expected €5bn loan for embattled French carmaker Renault, which in February reported its first annual loss in a decade.The company has been planning to unveil a big restructuring plan on 29 May that was reportedly likely to see it close three factories in Choisy-le-Roi, Dieppe and Caudan. A fourth factory, Flins, will be converted into an electric battery factory. Mr Macron said on Tuesday that Renault had agreed to join a Franco-German project to produce electric batteries for the rechargeable auto industry, a step the government had set as a condition for the loan.But Mr Macron said the government would not sign off on the deal until Renault's management and unions had concluded talks over the carmaker's French workforce and plants in France.Mr Macron only guaranteed the future for employees of Renault's factories in Mauberge and Douai, however. And French daily national newspaper Le Figaro reported exclusively on Tuesday that Renault is planning to cut 5,000 jobs by 2024.The 370 employees that work at the Fonderie de Bretagne, near Lorient in north-western France, are concerned that the carmaker intends to close the factory. They have been protesting since Monday, blockading the factory, and told French national radio network Europe 1 that they intend to march on the streets of Lorient on Wednesday.",26 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: 'Short-lived' rebound in house hunter demand,"Demand from property hunters rebounded as curbs on the sector were lifted in England - but the trend may be short-lived, analysis suggests.Buyer demand rose by 88% in the week estate agents were told they could resume viewings and people could move again, property portal Zoopla said.However, actual sales remained sluggish, and the analysis suggests demand could fall again. A tough outlook for jobs could affect people's ability to move home.For those who do still have the money to move, Zoopla echoed others in suggesting residents may have spent lockdown rethinking what they want from their home.Another property portal, Rightmove, reported a return to pre-crisis levels of browsing and enquiries from people looking to buy a home at the point restrictions were lifted in England on 13 May.Now, Zoopla's UK Cities House Price Index has said that the rebound in demand went beyond the level seen at the start of March. Portsmouth, Southampton, Oxford, Liverpool and Manchester all saw demand rise.This trend was far more muted where the restrictions remained - in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland - and also in London, where the market had already been relatively slow.The analysis found the rebound would be temporary, after people who had been stuck at home and thinking of moving met with the realities of less settled job prospects.""Many households are likely to have re-evaluated what they want from their home. This could well explain the scale of the demand returning to the market,"" said Richard Donnell, director of research at Zoopla. He said economic uncertainty was building and that would eventually lead to greater caution among buyers and sellers.A small survey, as part of the research, found that 41% of those asked had put moving plans on hold owing to the uncertainty, loss of income, or future prospects for their finances.Lockdown had meant thousands of people put house sales on hold.Residential property sales in the UK in April hit their lowest monthly level since comparable records began in 2005, with 38,060 transactions during the month, according to provisional numbers from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).This was less than half the level seen in the same month the previous year.Great uncertainty remains over the level of recovery in sales, as well as prices.Meanwhile, Rightmove said that, in the week after restrictions in England were lifted, interest from those looking to move in the private rental sector had increased ahead of the level seen at the same time last year.Monday 18 May saw its highest level of rental demand in a single day.The biggest increases in rental searches compared with a year ago were in Rotherham, Cambridge and St Helens, it said.""A week's worth of data should only be taken as an early indication of activity, but it's certainly encouraging,"" said Miles Shipside, from Rightmove.",27 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: 'Mums do most childcare and chores in lockdown',"Mums appear to be doing most of the housework and childcare during lockdown, according to a new study.Research suggest that in homes where there is a working mother and father, women are doing more chores and spending more time with children.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and University College London (UCL) interviewed 3,500 families.They found that mums were only able to do one hour of uninterrupted work, for every three hours done by dads.""Mothers are doing, on average, more childcare and more housework than fathers who have the same work arrangements,"" said Lucy Kraftman, a research economist at the IFS.She said the finding applied to families where a mother and father were both working, as well as to families where both parents were furloughed or out of work.""The only set of households where we see mothers and fathers sharing childcare and housework equally are those in which both parents were previously working, but the father has now stopped working for pay, while the mother is still in paid work,"" she said.""However, mothers in these households are doing paid work during an average of five hours a day, in addition to doing the same amount of domestic work as their partner.""Paula Sheridan, a coach whose firm Unwrapping Potential works with professional women, says her clients ""almost universally"" report that they are the ones planning meals, creating timetables and downloading learning resources for children - along with dozens of other tasks.""I'm the main wage earner and yet I also seem to be the one who stops work to make lunch and dinner, because he wouldn't think of doing it,"" one client told her.Another told her: ""[My partner] is furloughed and yet my work telephone calls are interrupted by the children asking questions, while daddy is just watching Netflix.""Ms Sheridan believes the different approach to household tasks and childcare responsibilities begins during maternity leave.Only 2% of new mums and dads split their entitlement to parental leave. This generally leaves woman in charge of establishing a routine and learning how to be a parent - usually by trial and error, she says.Being a parent involves making sure there's food in the house, cooking, arranging childcare where necessary. And as children grow older, keeping track of after-school activities and making sure the kids make it to birthday parties, hopefully with the right gift.""It isn't a man versus women thing at all,"" Ms Sheridan says. ""The partner has no idea that all of this stuff even happens, because he has never needed to.""Mums still tend to be the ones organising how time is spent at home under lockdown, she adds.As a result, mothers in two-parent households are only doing, on average, a third of the uninterrupted paid-work hours of fathers, UCL and the IFS found.Before lockdown, mothers completed on average around 60% of the uninterrupted work hours that fathers did.""A risk is that the lockdown leads to a further increase in the gender wage gap,"" said Alison Andrew from the IFS.But her colleague, Sonya Krutikova, points to some cause for hope that the lockdown may lead to a more equal sharing of household tasks between parents.""Fathers, on average, are doing nearly double the hours of childcare they were doing prior to the crisis,"" she said.""This may bring about changes in the attitudes of fathers, mothers, children and employers about the role of fathers in meeting family needs for childcare and domestic work during the working week.""",27 May 2020,business
Warner Music Group eyes $13.2bn valuation,"Warner Music Group (WMG), the record label of Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars, estimates it is worth up to $13.2bn (£10.7bn), as it prepares to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange.That is four times what Sir Leonard Blavatnik paid in 2011 for WMG - the world's third largest record label.At the time, the music industry was in the depths of a multi-year slump, but sales have improved more recently.Warner Music said it is hoping to raise $1.8bn via the listing.The firm had put its flotation plans on hold as the coronavirus pandemic cast financial markets into turmoil this spring.But shares have been on the upswing recently, as investors cheer relief efforts by governments and central banks, hoping for a quick economic rebound.Warner Music said existing shareholders would sell 70 million shares priced at $23-$26 apiece. The proceeds would go to Mr Blavatnik's company, Access Industries, which will retain majority voting power.The firm represents more than 80,000 songwriters and composers, from Beethoven to Madonna. It reported a profit of $256m in its most recent financial year, on revenue of $4.5bn.The industry's recovery has been helped by the rise of paid streaming services such as Apple and Spotify. In 2019, global music revenues rose 8.2% to $20.2bn - more than half of which came from streaming services, according to industry group International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).Ukrainian-born Mr Blavatnik now has joint UK-US citizenship and received a knighthood in 2017 for services to philanthropy.He sold a stake in Russian oil company TNK-BP for $7bn in 2013 and was an early investor in the Apple-owned Beats music subscription service.

Coronavirus: New York Stock Exchange trading floor reopens,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has reopened its trading floor after a two-month closure due to the coronavirus pandemic.But as new social distance rules come into effect, the exchange looks and feels very different.The NYSE is one of the few bourses to still feature floor trade - most have shifted to fully-electronic trading.New York City has been hit hard by the outbreak with some 200,000 cases and more than 20,000 deaths.Financial markets have continued to trade throughout the pandemic, but the exchange's trading floor was closed from 23 March and activity temporarily moved to fully-electronic trading to protect workers.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was on hand to ring the bell that re-started in-person trade, a sign of the symbolic weight attached to the reopening.US shares gained on Tuesday amid investor enthusiasm about economic rebound, but the new NYSE rules are a reminder that a full return to business will take time.""It's not about returning to normal,"" NYSE president Stacey Cunningham told the BBC. ""It's about living with this global pandemic until there's a vaccine.""She added that she had faced ""no pressure"" from the Trump administration, which follows financial markets closely and has generally supported a rapid reopening. Under the NYSE changes, only a quarter of the normal number of traders will be allowed to return to work.Traders must also avoid public transport, wear masks and follow strict social distancing rules, with newly fitted transparent barriers to keep people apart.They will also be screened and have their temperatures taken as they enter the building. Anyone who fails pass the check will be barred until they test negative for coronavirus or self-quarantine in accordance with US government guidelines.To return to their jobs, floor traders also have to sign a liability waiver that prevents them from suing the NYSE if they get infected at the exchange. Some large financial companies, such as Morgan Stanley, have reportedly balked at signing, but Ms Cunningham defended the waiver as a way to ensure that traders, which are not employed by the exchange, abide by the new rules. ""We need to make sure that they're committed to following this new norm,"" she said.NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, is the world's largest stock exchange in terms of the total market capitalisation of listed companies.The 228-year-old exchange last closed its doors on 29 October 2012 due to Hurricane Sandy. It also shut for four sessions in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. But the bourse resisted closing at the start of the pandemic and the closure reignited debate about the necessity of the floor in an era dominated by electronic activity.Ms Cunningham said trading has functioned smoothly with the floor closed, but she believed reopening will further ease volatility and help smaller firms that rely on in-person trades for their business.""We are relevant we are necessary and WE ARE BACK,"" floor trader Peter Tuchman wrote on Twitter ahead of the reopening.Greatest group of people I’ve ever met & to ever walk the floors of the NYSE are returning to the greatest job on earth to do what they do best ... screw the nay sayers that NYSE has seen its last days ... 💥F-that .. we are relevant we are necessary and WE ARE BACK pic.twitter.com/SaaDT0vrmjEnd of Twitter post  by @EinsteinoWallStFor most people outside the financial world, NYSE's trading floor is a rare glimpse into the seemingly opaque workings of the global markets as well as being a colourful setting for companies to showcase their stock market debuts.The new regulations mean that the NYSE's high-profile opening bell events and stock market debut celebrations have been put on hold as visitors are banned.Media organisations that usually broadcast from the trading floor won't be allowed back until further notice.In the BBC interview, Ms Cunningham also addressed a proposal by US lawmakers to require companies that sell shares in the US to abide by American accounting rules and audits, or face de-listing. The move, which comes as US-China tensions increase, is aimed at Chinese companies. The Senate passed the measure last week and the House is expected to take up the measure before the end of the summer. Ms Cunningham in the past has said de-listing Chinese companies generally would simply shift their business elsewhere. On Tuesday, she said lawmakers should ""balance"" investor protections and investor choice, but that the exchange backs efforts that would enhance the information supplied to investors.""Any measures to enforce that are highly supported by us,"" she said.Trading - but not as we know itAnalysis by Samira Hussain, BBC reporter New YorkBefore the coronavirus, I was a regular on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. It may be one of the great symbols of US capitalism, but it's also, just a workplace for hundreds of traders, market makers, and various bystanders such as journalists.And like so many offices and shop floors it's not somewhere that you would ever associate with social distancing, keeping two metres apart and wearing masks. Quite the reverse - face-to-face stock trading is sometimes close to a contact sport, as is reporting from the floor. So the NYSE has to take its reopening very slowly. It will be a relief for some traders to be back to work, but it's not going to look like the trading floor we're all used to seeing for quite some time.",26 May 2020,business
Find out which masks offer the most protection and why,"While paper and cloth masks may help controlling the spread of Covid-19 amongst the general public, they're certainly not up to the mark for use in intensive care.Here, where the risk of infection is at its greatest, medical staff need personal protective equipment of a far higher standard, capable of shielding them completely from the virus. The simplest form of face covering is the surgical mask, generally made of three layers of paper or cloth. They're resistant to droplets such as those caused by coughing or sneezing, but give little protection against viral particles themselves, which are only around 100 nanometres in size (a nanometre being a billionth of a metre).""A mask, which goes over your nose and mouth, but doesn't fit tightly to your face, is really there to be a barrier for any particles that you might expel,"" explains Dr Nikki McCullough, head of safety for 3M, one of the world's biggest suppliers of respiratory protection. ""The mask isn't going to prevent you from breathing in very small particles.""Respirators, on the other hand, are designed to fit tightly to the face, so that no air can leak in or out, and require a rigorous fitting process.""When you breathe in, all the air goes through the filter media, and that filter media has been tested to a performance standard,"" says Dr McCullough. ""So you can be sure that if you get a good seal to your face, the respirator is reducing the number of particles that you're going to breathe into your lungs.""Respirators come in various different forms, the simplest being mask-like filtering facepiece (FFP) respirators; some are designed to be disposable, whereas others can be disinfected and reused.More Technology of BusinessIn the US, FFP respirators are classified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in terms of the percentage of particles they filter out. Thus, N95 and N99 masks filter out 95% and 99% of particles respectively, while N100 devices eliminate 99.97%. In Europe, respirators are classified slightly differently. Respirators rated FFP1 filter out at least 80% of particles; FFP2s remove at least 94%, and FFP3 devices correspond to N100 by filtering out at least 99.97%.Meanwhile, similar to an FFP3 mask in effectiveness, but certainly not in appearance, are diving helmet-style powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs).""There you have a more comprehensive solution. There's a hood face shield and a tube that would connect into a unit on the belt,"" says Brian Hovey, chief marketing officer for major respirator manufacturer Honeywell. ""That has an engine or a motor that pumps air through a filter: it's part of a white suit, so it's a more comprehensive protective solution.""At the University of Southampton, engineers have developed a PAPR that they're supplying to University Hospital Southampton - 1,000 are already in use. It's currently undergoing the official rating and approval process, so it's not yet in use in intensive care or triage, where FFP3 respirators are required. However, two firms are making them and 5,000 have been ordered for staff in other settings.The testing process involved both a smell test to see whether the wearer could detect outside smells, as well as a physical test of whether tiny particles are indeed filtered out.""We put a petri dish inside the hood and another one outside, and delivered 1,000 litres of air through the filter,"" explains Alex Dickinson, an associate professor in the university's bioengineering science research group.""We incubated them for 24 hours at 37C and then counted how many of these colony-forming units had been transmitted through the filter and hood. On our first experiment, we saw no units of bacterial growth inside the hood, but ten formed on the control plate outside.""The British Standards Institute is currently evaluating the device against European standards, after which, hopes the team, it can be used more widely at Southampton and elsewhere.""Your vision is much better, and your communication is better, as the patient can see your whole face; your efficiency is much better as you can move from patient to patient without putting on and taking off your PPE,"" says hospital consultant and professor in respiratory medicine Paul Elkington.""Once we started rolling it out, one of the healthcare assistants said to me 'I've been feeling sick with nerves about coming in, but now I feel secure'.""Until recently, the market for respirators was mainly industrial - manufacturing, construction and the like.""If we look at six months ago, with full-face respirators - FFP2s and FFP3s - demand from healthcare was very low,"" says Dr McCullough. ""They really only used them for tuberculosis, maybe a measles case. But now we see that healthcare everywhere in the world is using respirators at a much, much higher rate.""As a result, manufacturers have been working flat out to increase capacity to meet the new demand.""We've made significant investment in both ramping up capacity at our existing facilities as well as new facilities. Most notably, in the US, we've just had our first products coming off the line in our Smithfield, Rhode Island facility, and we hit 500,000 units earlier this past week,"" says Honeywell's Brian Hovey. ""Similarly, we've ramped up our build capacity and we're starting to get product out in Phoenix. These new facilities are adding about 20 million units per month, and we're evaluating potential new facilities around the globe.""Dr McCullough says that 3M is also increasing production, adding extra shifts and improving efficiency.""We can make the same products but more quickly; we are adding new lines and we are looking at some small changes to certain products, looking at new headbands, for example,"" she says. So will the global supply hold up?""In the immediate term, probably not, unfortunately - the uptick we've seen has been unprecedented and depending on how people are thinking of them as a consumer product, demand far outstrips global supply,"" says Mr Hovey.But, he adds, ""We're having a good dialogue with governments around preparing for the future, and we make sure that strategic stockpiles are adequately supplied. ""If - god forbid - another situation like this occurs, collectively we'll be able to respond quickly and effectively.""",26 May 2020,business
The man who sells 700 million sandwiches a year,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Patrick Coveney, chief executive of convenience food group Greencore.When you are the UK's largest maker of pre-packaged sandwiches the coronavirus lockdown is a significant problem.With everyone except key workers being asked to stay at home from 23 March, Greencore suddenly saw a vast drop in customer numbers.Supplying own-brand sandwiches to all the major supermarkets, and staff canteens - overnight there was hardly anybody in the UK's offices and other workplaces, to pop out in their lunch-break and buy a BLT or egg mayo.As a result, Greencore says its main ""food to go"" division, which usually sells 700 million sandwiches per year, plus salads and sushi, saw sales slump by 70% over the following month and a half.Patrick, who has led the Dublin-based and London-listed company since 2008 says it has been a ""period of unprecedented uncertainty"". And in an interview with Irish broadcaster RTE, he said it made previous worries about Brexit ""seem very trivial.In response to coronavirus, Greencore has shut three of its 16 UK facilities and furloughed 4,000 of its 11,500 employees. Patrick and his fellow board members have cut their own pay by 30%.He says he is proud of the staff that have remained in work, making sandwiches that include the ""thousands"" given for free to NHS workers across 20 UK hospitals.""Our people have been working around the clock to ensure that we can continue to provide high quality, fresh prepared food to both consumers and frontline workers during the pandemic.""Born in the Republic of Ireland in 1971, the 49-year-old is from a celebrated Irish family that is sometimes referred to as ""the Kennedys of County Cork"". Patrick's late father Hugh was a government minister in the 1990s. His brother Simon is the current tánaiste or deputy prime minister.After school Patrick gained a degree in commerce from the University College Cork. He then went to Oxford University, for a masters in management studies. He played rugby at both universities, and says the sport helped teach him ""the importance of building and working in great teams"".Oxford was followed by spending a decade at management consultants McKinsey, before he joined Greencore in 2005, as chief financial officer.Greencore had been set up in 1991 following the privatisation of the former state-owned Irish Sugar. It moved into convenience foods in 2001 before completely exiting the sugar business in 2006. In 2011 it switched its primary listing from the Irish Stock Exchange to London.While making sandwiches is the bulk of its business, it also produces a range of chilled prepared meals - everything from curries, to quiches and soups. The company says sales of these in first six weeks of the lockdown were higher than last year as people did more cooking at home. However, the rise was only as much as 5%.Although coronavirus is a challenge for Greencore, it is not the first major problem Patrick has had to deal with at the company. In 2008, only three months after he was promoted to chief executive, a £15m fraud was discovered at the company's Scottish water subsidiary Campsie.Patrick sacked three senior managers over the scandal. It was, he says, ""the most challenging moment"" of his professional life, and that it made him ""stronger and more determined as person and as a leader"".Retail analyst Nick Widdowson, founder of Shopper First, says that looking forward, a major issue facing Greencore and other makers of convenience food is how to reduce or remove the plastic packaging.""Providing ethically fresh, authentic, locally sourced product, together with sustainable packaging, will be key to any producer of convenience foods seeking to meet their consumers' changing expectations,"" he says.Patrick agrees. ""Two years ago I could make a balanced and consumer-friendly argument that packaging prolongs the life of food and produce items. [But] the world has moved on, plastic is seen as a problem, and so we need to find alternatives that are better for the environment.""More The Boss features:While Greencore's 2020 revenues and profits will inevitably be down on 2019's £1.5bn and £56.4m figures, the company says that sales of its pre-packaged sandwiches have now started to recover in recent weeks as more people have returned to work.It also said that a survey of 7,000 customers showed that many were now ""bored and frustrated"" with having to making their own lunches at home.""Greencore has an absolutely critical role to play in keeping the UK fed... and there is a powerful sense of commitment, skill, spirit, and purpose across the Greencore workforce in performing this role,"" says Patrick.",25 May 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

"Record drop in energy investment, warns International Energy Agency","The coronavirus crisis is causing the biggest fall in global energy investment in history. Before the pandemic, funding was set to rise 2%, but now it’s predicted to plunge 20%, says the International Energy Agency (IEA).Fossil fuels are hit hardest, with a 30% funding drop expected for oil and a 15% fall for coal.Renewables investment is down 10% - and it's only about half what’s needed to combat climate change.Due to coronavirus lockdown measures imposed by many countries, for the time being, the fall in investment is leading to a drop in planet-heating carbon emissions.But the IEA warns that that use of fossil fuels is likely to rebound when the crisis is over, leading to a spike in CO2.One reason is because China and other Asian nations are putting in orders now for a new generation of coal-fired power plants to supply energy in the future.“We see a historical decline in emissions, but unless we have the right economic recovery packages, we might see emissions again skyrocket and the decline of this year would be completely wasted,"" the IEA's executive director Fatih Birol told the BBC.“Remember the 2008-2009 crashes. We immediately saw a decline in emissions, but afterwards it rebounded. We must learn from history.”Approvals of new coal plants in the first quarter of 2020, mainly in China, were running at twice the rate observed over the whole of 2019, he added.Overall energy investment has fallen almost $400bn (£324.3bn) short of what was expected in 2020, and the IEA says there are now serious doubts about secure energy supplies when the global economy picks up, because energy projects take so long to deliver.The report says the decline in investment is “staggering” in its scale and swiftness, mostly due to low demand and low prices for energy, especially oil.Dr Birol said: “The historic plunge in investment is deeply troubling. It means lost jobs and economic opportunities today, as well as lost energy supply that we might well need tomorrow, once the economy recovers. “The slowdown in spending also risks undermining the much-needed transition to more sustainable energy systems.” The report says a combination of falling demand, lower prices and a rise in non-payment of bills means energy revenues to governments and industry are set to fall by well over a trillion dollars in 2020. Oil accounts for most of the total of this decline. Shale gas – previously the darling of the energy sector - is anticipated to take the biggest percentage hit overall, with a 50% investment fall.Renewables investment has been more resilient, but spending on rooftop solar installations by has been strongly affected. Energy efficiency is suffering too, as investment is set to fall by an estimated 10-15%.The overall share of global energy spending that goes to clean energy has been stuck at around one-third in recent years.In 2020 it will jump towards 40% of total investment - but that’s only relative, because fossil fuels are taking such a battering.Dr Birol added: “The crisis has brought lower emissions but for all the wrong reasons. If we are to achieve a lasting reduction in global emissions, then we will need to see a rapid increase in clean energy investment.”Decisions to commission new coal-fired plants are down more than 80% since 2015, but the global coal fleet continues to grow.Follow Roger on Twitter.",27 May 2020,business
