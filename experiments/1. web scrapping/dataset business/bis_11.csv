Coronavirus: Leading economist warns of 10 years of depression and debt,"Economist Nouriel Roubini has warned of a prolonged downturn and sluggish recovery from the coronavirus.Nicknamed Dr Doom for his gloomy predictions, Professor Roubini said there are some jobs that simply will not come back after this crisis.Even if the global economy recovers this year from the impact of the coronavirus, it will be ""anaemic"".He warned of ""unprecedented"" recession. Professor Roubini foresaw the financial crisis in 2008 before many others.""During the global financial crisis it took about three years until output fell sharply,"" he told the BBC's Talking Asia programme from his home in New York. ""This time around it didn't take three years, not even three months. In three weeks there was a freefall of every component.""Professor Roubini also said any recovery will be in the shape of what economists call a ""U"", or even ""something closer to an L"" - what he calls a ""Greater Depression.""A U-shaped recovery means that growth will fall and bottom out, and then pick up only after a prolonged period of slow or no growth. An L shaped recovery is even more drastic - falling sharply and staying there for an extended period of time. That's because of how many jobs have been lost in both rich and poor countries as a result of massive lockdowns to combat the virus. ""These jobs that are gone are going to come back only in part, with lower wages, no benefits, part-time,"" he said. ""There will be even more insecurity of jobs and income and wages for the average working person.""His warning comes as the number of coronavirus cases globally tops five million, with many countries seeing a second wave of infections and struggling to reopen their economies - a key factor in whether economic growth can bounce back quickly. ""You can open the stores but the question is whether they're going to come back,"" he says. ""Most of the shopping centres in China are still empty. Half of the flights aren't there. German shops are open but who wants to go and shop?""Emerging Asia though will see better growth than ""other advanced economies.""But there will be a greater split between the US and China, and many Asian countries will be forced to choose between the two superpowers. ""Each one of them is going to say to the rest of the world, either you are with us or against us,"" he says. ""Either you use my AI systems, my 5G, my technologies, my robotics. Or you are using the one of my rival's. Therefore there is going to be a more divided world.""Professor Roubini's moniker of Dr Doom was earned after he was famously and consistently negative on the global economy's prospects - even as the US entered a stellar decade of stock market returns. When asked whether holding a negative position for so long meant that at some point he would almost certainly be right, he told me he prefers the name Dr Realist, to Dr Doom. ""When everyone said that China was going to have a hard landing in 2015, I said it will be bumpy,"" he told me. ""I've actually been more optimistic than Wall Street was. The people who say I'm a broken clock that is right twice a day have not followed me.""BBC World News - Talking Business, Beyond the Crisis",22 May 2020,business
Hertz: Car rental firm files for US bankruptcy protection,"Car rental company Hertz has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after the pandemic saw its business plummet.The firm, which earns much of its income from car rentals at airports, said it had been affected by the sharp downturn in global travel.It will continue to operate while restructuring its debts.Hertz's international operations in Europe, Australia and New Zealand as well as its franchised locations in the US are not affected.The company - which began operating a century ago in Chicago with a dozen Model T Ford cars - had already furloughed or laid off 20,000 employees, or around half of its global workforce, in response to the pandemic.Its chief executive resigned last week.Before the pandemic the company had amassed billions of dollars in debt, with the rise of ride-hailing apps leading to a drop in demand for car rentals.""The impact of Covid-19 on travel demand was sudden and dramatic, causing an abrupt decline in the company's revenue and future bookings,"" Hertz said on Friday.While it had taken ""immediate actions to prioritize the health and safety of employees and customers, eliminate all non-essential spending and preserve liquidity"", the uncertainty over if and when the market would recover led to its decision, it said.",23 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Chinese retail giant Alibaba sees 'recovery' after virus,"Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said it has seen a ""steady recovery"" in the country since March, but warned that the path to an economic rebound remains uncertain.The firm's sales grew 22% in the three months to 31 March, despite virus-related restrictions denting activity.The gain was stronger than expected, driven by demand for groceries, electronics and cloud computing.Supply chain disruptions and investment losses weighed on its results overall.The performance of China's economy - in which Alibaba is a key player - is being closely watched as a preview of how the rest of the world might fare following abrupt economic shutdowns aimed at controlling the spread of Covid-19.The country's government said this week that it would not set an economic growth target. This marks the first time it has declined to do so since 1990.Many global companies have also scrapped forecasts for the year ahead, citing uncertainty due to the pandemic.On Friday, Alibaba, which runs one of the world's largest groups of shopping and digital media websites, also warned of uncertainty. But it told investors that it expected revenue growth of about 27% over the next 12 months, compared to 35% in the prior year.""Although the pandemic negatively impacted most of our domestic core commerce businesses starting in late January, we have seen steady recovery since March,"" Alibaba chief financial officer Maggie Wu said. Alibaba profits were, however, almost completely wiped out in the three months to 31 March. The company said this was largely down to a loss of investment income. The firm reported sales of $16bn (114.3bn yuan, £13.1bn) in the same period, with revenue on its core shopping websites up by almost 19%. Sales in the firm's cloud computing division jumped 58%. However its international businesses saw significantly slower growth. This branch includes Southeast Asia shopping website Lazada and account for about 7% of the firm's revenue.""For our international commerce businesses... the timing and pace of recovery is still uncertain as demand in countries outside China remains soft,"" Alibaba said.",22 May 2020,business
China scraps annual economic growth target for first time,"China will not set an economic growth goal for this year as it deals with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.It is the first time Beijing has not had a gross domestic product (GDP) target since 1990 when records began.The announcement was made by Premier Li Keqiang at the start of the country's annual parliament meeting.The world's second largest economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter from a year ago as lockdowns paralysed businesses.“This is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,” Premier Li said.The country's leadership has promised to boost economic support measures amid growing concerns that rising unemployment could threaten social stability.The move comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington are becoming increasingly strained over the coronavirus pandemic, trade and Hong Kong.On Thursday, President Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on China, suggesting that the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, is behind a “disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.”It came as Mr Trump and other Republicans have escalated their criticism of Beijing's handling of the early stages of the outbreak. Also on Thursday, China announced plans to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong after last year’s pro-democracy protests.The announcement was met with a warning from Mr Trump that the US would react “very strongly” against any attempt to gain more control over the former British colony.Separately, two US senators have proposed legislation to punish Chinese entities involved in enforcing the planned new laws and penalise banks that do business with them.Earlier this week, the US Senate unanimously passed a proposal to delist Chinese companies from American stock exchanges if they fail to comply with US financial reporting standards.US-listed Chinese companies have come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.",22 May 2020,business
UK borrowing at record high as virus cost soars in April,"Government borrowing surged to £62bn in April, the highest monthly figure on record, after heavy spending to ease the coronavirus crisis.It means the deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - was larger last month than forecast for the whole year at the time of the Budget. The data from the Office for National Statistics revealed the soaring cost of support, such as furlough schemes.But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said things would be worse without government aid.The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach £298bn, more than five times the estimate at the time of the March Budget.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, described April's figure as ""pretty much unprecedented"". It said the cost of furlough schemes alone was £14bn in April.""Borrowing now is about six times what it was [in April] last year, so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances,"" Mr Athow told the BBC.He added it was impossible to forecast the current year's public finances because of the ""high amounts of uncertainty"". Tax receipts have fallen heavily, as the Treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments. The amount received from VAT in April was negative, with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments.Meanwhile, borrowing by the state in March 2020 has been revised up by £11.7bn to £14.7bn, the ONS said.It said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and National Insurance contributions.The surge in borrowing comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown.After publication of the figures, Mr Sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support, the cost to the economy and people's livelihoods would be much worse.""Our top priority is to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible,"" he said.""That's why we've taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts.""For the past decade, the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping, aiming for position where it could cover day-to-day spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit. But then the crisis hit - and as the chancellor claims, the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over, to prevent an even bigger economic disaster. It was worth ripping up the rulebook for, he said.However the bills are mounting, just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped.  This year's deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the Second World War - and that hole needs plugging.For the moment, the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets, through bonds, effectively IOUs - but there is a limit to how much it can  do so. Ultimately, economists say taxes will have to rise, or spending cut - the emergency raft will have a price tag which we can't escape.But the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery. And if he opts for tax hikes, he'll risk breaking some election promises.The scale of the economic consequences was underlined on Friday in separate retail sales data from the ONS. These showed that High Street sales crashed last month as shops closed for the lockdown.It was also announced on Friday that a mortgage payment holiday scheme for homeowners in financial difficulty during the pandemic has been extended for another three months.As a result of the jump in borrowing, total public sector debt rose to £1,888bn at the end of April - £118.4bn higher than April 2019.Former chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: ""We have to come to terms with the fact that Britain is poorer and the economy is smaller than it would have been.""Asked if the economy would bounce back, he said: ""Bounce is the wrong word, but it will recover."" Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, described April's borrowing as ""alarmingly high"", but added that a small easing of the lockdown from 13 May probably meant the government would not have to borrow as much this month.And despite the pressure on public finances, Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said there were no signs the government was struggling to raise money on the financial markets.""Record low interest rates mean the UK's higher debt burden should remain more than manageable,"" he said.

Coronavirus: US workers seeking jobless aid near 40 million,"A further 2.4 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, despite hopes that easing lockdown restrictions would help restart the US economy.The new filings brought the total since mid-March to roughly 38.6 million - almost a quarter of the workforce.The weekly figures have declined since peaking at almost 6.9 million at the end of March but remain high.The number of people remaining on benefits also continues to grow.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned this week that the US risked ""permanent damage"" if the lockdowns continued.All 50 states in the US have started to reopen but it is not clear whether simply easing restrictions will prompt activity to rebound.In the week ending 16 May, about 2.2 million people sought unemployment benefits under the government's pandemic relief programme, which expanded eligibility to people such as gig economy workers. Their numbers, which are reported separately from the regular figures, are likely to grow as more states implement the programme.""This is so tragic it is almost unfathomable,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, wrote on Twitter.Add 2.2 m in PUI - self employed expansion to UI not counted in the initial UI data and the situation in mid May is even worse. This is so tragic it is almost unfathomable. https://t.co/K4hqde3OpAEnd of Twitter post  by @DianeSwonkEmployers in the US cut more than 20 million jobs last month, sending the official unemployment rate to 14.7%, a sharp rise from 50-year lows of about 3.5% seen as recently as February. Economists have warned that the rate is likely to worsen and remain elevated for several years.While many of the unemployed said they believed their layoffs were temporary, a recent study estimated that more than 40% of recent pandemic job cuts are likely to be permanent.Companies such as Uber are among the firms that have announced significant job cuts in recent weeks, as they prepare for a prolonged slowdown. Retailers have also unveiled scores of permanent shop closures, with Victoria's Secret this week saying it would close some 250 locations in North America, with more expected.""Overall there is little evidence that the reopening of the economy has, as yet, led to any sudden snap back in employment,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.Nearly half of US households have lost income since the pandemic lockdowns came into effect two months ago, according to a survey published Wednesday by the US Census. About 37% expect to lose income in the next month.The effect on spending - which powers the US economy - has already been felt, with retail sales falling a record 16.4% in April, the Commerce Department reported last week.",21 May 2020,business

Coronavirus: US workers seeking jobless aid near 40 million,"A further 2.4 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, despite hopes that easing lockdown restrictions would help restart the US economy.The new filings brought the total since mid-March to roughly 38.6 million - almost a quarter of the workforce.The weekly figures have declined since peaking at almost 6.9 million at the end of March but remain high.The number of people remaining on benefits also continues to grow.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned this week that the US risked ""permanent damage"" if the lockdowns continued.All 50 states in the US have started to reopen but it is not clear whether simply easing restrictions will prompt activity to rebound.In the week ending 16 May, about 2.2 million people sought unemployment benefits under the government's pandemic relief programme, which expanded eligibility to people such as gig economy workers.

Coronavirus: Leading economist warns of 10 years of depression and debt,"Economist Nouriel Roubini has warned of a prolonged downturn and sluggish recovery from the coronavirus.Nicknamed Dr Doom for his gloomy predictions, Professor Roubini said there are some jobs that simply will not come back after this crisis.Even if the global economy recovers this year from the impact of the coronavirus, it will be ""anaemic"".He warned of ""unprecedented"" recession. Professor Roubini foresaw the financial crisis in 2008 before many others.""During the global financial crisis it took about three years until output fell sharply,"" he told the BBC's Talking Asia programme from his home in New York. ""This time around it didn't take three years, not even three months. In three weeks there was a freefall of every component.""Professor Roubini also said any recovery will be in the shape of what economists call a ""U"", or even ""something closer to an L"" - what he calls a ""Greater Depression.""A U-shaped recovery means that growth will fall and bottom out, and then pick up only after a prolonged period of slow or no growth. An L shaped recovery is even more drastic - falling sharply and staying there for an extended period of time. That's because of how many jobs have been lost in both rich and poor countries as a result of massive lockdowns to combat the virus. ""These jobs that are gone are going to come back only in part, with lower wages, no benefits, part-time,"" he said. ""There will be even more insecurity of jobs and income and wages for the average working person.""His warning comes as the number of coronavirus cases globally tops five million, with many countries seeing a second wave of infections and struggling to reopen their economies - a key factor in whether economic growth can bounce back quickly. ""You can open the stores but the question is whether they're going to come back,"" he says. ""Most of the shopping centres in China are still empty. Half of the flights aren't there. German shops are open but who wants to go and shop?""Emerging Asia though will see better growth than ""other advanced economies.""But there will be a greater split between the US and China, and many Asian countries will be forced to choose between the two superpowers. ""Each one of them is going to say to the rest of the world, either you are with us or against us,"" he says. ""Either you use my AI systems, my 5G, my technologies, my robotics. Or you are using the one of my rival's. Therefore there is going to be a more divided world.""Professor Roubini's moniker of Dr Doom was earned after he was famously and consistently negative on the global economy's prospects - even as the US entered a stellar decade of stock market returns. When asked whether holding a negative position for so long meant that at some point he would almost certainly be right, he told me he prefers the name Dr Realist, to Dr Doom. ""When everyone said that China was going to have a hard landing in 2015, I said it will be bumpy,"" he told me. ""I've actually been more optimistic than Wall Street was.

Hertz: Car rental firm files for US bankruptcy protection,"Car rental company Hertz has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after the pandemic saw its business plummet.The firm, which earns much of its income from car rentals at airports, said it had been affected by the sharp downturn in global travel.It will continue to operate while restructuring its debts.Hertz's international operations in Europe, Australia and New Zealand as well as its franchised locations in the US are not affected.The company - which began operating a century ago in Chicago with a dozen Model T Ford cars - had already furloughed or laid off 20,000 employees, or around half of its global workforce, in response to the pandemic.Its chief executive resigned last week.Before the pandemic the company had amassed billions of dollars in debt, with the rise of ride-hailing apps leading to a drop in demand for car rentals.""The impact of Covid-19 on travel demand was sudden and dramatic, causing an abrupt decline in the company's revenue and future bookings,"" Hertz said on Friday.While it had taken ""immediate actions to prioritize the health and safety of employees and customers, eliminate all non-essential spending and preserve liquidity"", the uncertainty over if and when the market would recover led to its decision, it said.",23 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Chinese retail giant Alibaba sees 'recovery' after virus,"Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said it has seen a ""steady recovery"" in the country since March, but warned that the path to an economic rebound remains uncertain.The firm's sales grew 22% in the three months to 31 March, despite virus-related restrictions denting activity.The gain was stronger than expected, driven by demand for groceries, electronics and cloud computing.Supply chain disruptions and investment losses weighed on its results overall.The performance of China's economy - in which Alibaba is a key player - is being closely watched as a preview of how the rest of the world might fare following abrupt economic shutdowns aimed at controlling the spread of Covid-19.The country's government said this week that it would not set an economic growth target. This marks the first time it has declined to do so since 1990.Many global companies have also scrapped forecasts for the year ahead, citing uncertainty due to the pandemic.On Friday, Alibaba, which runs one of the world's largest groups of shopping and digital media websites, also warned of uncertainty. But it told investors that it expected revenue growth of about 27% over the next 12 months, compared to 35% in the prior year.""Although the pandemic negatively impacted most of our domestic core commerce businesses starting in late January, we have seen steady recovery since March,"" Alibaba chief financial officer Maggie Wu said. Alibaba profits were, however, almost completely wiped out in the three months to 31 March. The company said this was largely down to a loss of investment income. The firm reported sales of $16bn (114.3bn yuan, £13.1bn) in the same period, with revenue on its core shopping websites up by almost 19%. Sales in the firm's cloud computing division jumped 58%. However its international businesses saw significantly slower growth. This branch includes Southeast Asia shopping website Lazada and account for about 7% of the firm's revenue.""For our international commerce businesses... the timing and pace of recovery is still uncertain as demand in countries outside China remains soft,"" Alibaba said.",22 May 2020,business
China scraps annual economic growth target for first time,"China will not set an economic growth goal for this year as it deals with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.It is the first time Beijing has not had a gross domestic product (GDP) target since 1990 when records began.The announcement was made by Premier Li Keqiang at the start of the country's annual parliament meeting.The world's second largest economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter from a year ago as lockdowns paralysed businesses.“This is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,” Premier Li said.The country's leadership has promised to boost economic support measures amid growing concerns that rising unemployment could threaten social stability.The move comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington are becoming increasingly strained over the coronavirus pandemic, trade and Hong Kong.On Thursday, President Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on China, suggesting that the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, is behind a “disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.”It came as Mr Trump and other Republicans have escalated their criticism of Beijing's handling of the early stages of the outbreak. Also on Thursday, China announced plans to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong after last year’s pro-democracy protests.The announcement was met with a warning from Mr Trump that the US would react “very strongly” against any attempt to gain more control over the former British colony.Separately, two US senators have proposed legislation to punish Chinese entities involved in enforcing the planned new laws and penalise banks that do business with them.Earlier this week, the US Senate unanimously passed a proposal to delist Chinese companies from American stock exchanges if they fail to comply with US financial reporting standards.US-listed Chinese companies have come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.",22 May 2020,business
UK borrowing at record high as virus cost soars in April,"Government borrowing surged to £62bn in April, the highest monthly figure on record, after heavy spending to ease the coronavirus crisis.It means the deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - was larger last month than forecast for the whole year at the time of the Budget. The data from the Office for National Statistics revealed the soaring cost of support, such as furlough schemes.But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said things would be worse without government aid.The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has predicted that borrowing for the whole year could reach £298bn, more than five times the estimate at the time of the March Budget.Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, described April's figure as ""pretty much unprecedented"". It said the cost of furlough schemes alone was £14bn in April.""Borrowing now is about six times what it was [in April] last year, so we are talking about some really significant changes in the government finances,"" Mr Athow told the BBC.He added it was impossible to forecast the current year's public finances because of the ""high amounts of uncertainty"". Tax receipts have fallen heavily, as the Treasury has allowed companies to defer some payments. The amount received from VAT in April was negative, with the government collecting less than was handed back in repayments.Meanwhile, borrowing by the state in March 2020 has been revised up by £11.7bn to £14.7bn, the ONS said.It said this was driven by a reduction in previous estimates of tax receipts and National Insurance contributions.The surge in borrowing comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak stepped up financial support for businesses and employees after vast areas of the economy were forced to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown.After publication of the figures, Mr Sunak said that if the government had not provided financial support, the cost to the economy and people's livelihoods would be much worse.""Our top priority is to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis and ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible,"" he said.""That's why we've taken unprecedented steps to provide lifelines to people and businesses with our furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts.""For the past decade, the government had been trying to practise strict financial housekeeping, aiming for position where it could cover day-to-day spending with the money form our taxes and eliminate the deficit. But then the crisis hit - and as the chancellor claims, the schemes put in place have provided a lifeline to tide millions over, to prevent an even bigger economic disaster. It was worth ripping up the rulebook for, he said.However the bills are mounting, just as the amount received from taxpayers slumped.  This year's deficit could be the equivalent of the biggest slice of our income since the Second World War - and that hole needs plugging.For the moment, the government has increased its borrowing on financial markets, through bonds, effectively IOUs - but there is a limit to how much it can  do so. Ultimately, economists say taxes will have to rise, or spending cut - the emergency raft will have a price tag which we can't escape.But the chancellor will have to impose those carefully to avoid jeopardising a recovery. And if he opts for tax hikes, he'll risk breaking some election promises.The scale of the economic consequences was underlined on Friday in separate retail sales data from the ONS.

How bad are China's economic woes?,"While economists say China's economic data can't always be trusted, they now have a new dilemma - there is no data.On Friday, China said it wouldn't be setting a target for economic growth for this year. That's unprecedented - the Chinese government hasn't done this since it began publishing such goals in 1990. Abandoning the growth target is an acknowledgement of just how difficult a recovery in China will be in a post pandemic era. And while recent figures have shown that China is on the way out of its slowdown: it's an uneven recovery. First, the good news. For the first time since the pandemic hit China - factories are making goods again.Industrial output in April grew by a better-than-expected 3.9% - a marked difference from the collapse of 13.5% in the first two months of this year as massive lockdowns were imposed. There's also a swathe of other data that has been surprisingly strong - pointing to what economists like to call a V-shaped recovery - a sharp, drastic initial fall - followed by a quick rebound in economic activity. Coal consumption by six major power generators surged back to historical norms after May's ""Golden week"" holidays, according to investment bank JP Morgan. It currently stands 1.5% above the historical average, suggesting that power demand has returned to normal.And the pollution-free Chinese skies that we saw in the aftermath of the lockdowns there - well, they've disappeared as economic activity has picked up. China's air pollution levels recently surpassed concentrations over the same period last year for the first time since the coronavirus crisis began, driven by industrial emissions. All of this shows that China is slowly getting back to business. But it's not business as usual, and this shows just how difficult it will be for the rest of us to get our economies going again. Recent retail sales figures show just how difficult it is going to be to get people into shops and buying things.Sales were down 7.5% in April - better than March - but nowhere near where they need to be for the economy to be running on full cylinders. Many Chinese people are still worried about a second wave of infection, and they're not spending as much as they used to.  It's no wonder China has abandoned it's growth target this year - the government knows it will be hard to forecast just how deep this crisis has become. Compounding all of that -  are the all-important unemployment figures - which officially came in slightly higher in April than in March, at 6%, edging closer to historical highs. But most economists say the real number is much worse. The ""true level of unemployment is likely double this"", given that around a fifth of migrant workers haven't returned to the cities, says the think tank Capital Economics. Even China's hard-line Communist mouthpiece the Global Times - typically the Chinese economy's biggest cheerleader - has pointed out how dire the employment picture is.It is saying that this year ""it will be nearly impossible for Chinese employees in the private sector to earn as much salary as they did in 2019,"" as small businesses have had to fire employees or cut staff.  It's going to get worse before it gets better. Some 85% of private enterprises will struggle to survive over the next three months, writes Prof Justin Yifu Lin of Peking University, citing a Tsinghua University survey in March. ""Bankruptcy of enterprises will lead to an increase in unemployment,"" he adds. Granted, many Chinese people are employed by state-owned enterprises, and China's economic system is able to absorb the ranks of the unemployed better than the US. Chinese people have more savings, better family support, and many migrant workers also have land back home that they can rely on for basic needs and even sustenance in the very worst of circumstances.""You will see a great transition of migrant workers going back to their villages where they have their own piece of land,"" Wang Huiyao of the Centre for China and Globalisation tells me. ""Yes, there will be some hardships, but people outside of China probably don't understand how we view hardships and difficulties - which Chinese people just experienced not too long ago when China was very poor. ""The Communist Party has always stated a growth target to achieve as a way of signalling how well China is doing.But clearly this time it's different: no target - so there's no getting away from the fact that the current economic environment is the most challenging China has faced in recent years. Indeed, China has been through difficult economic periods before - the 1990s, for instance, saw huge numbers of people laid off. The economy at the time was dominated by state-owned enterprises - they provided jobs for the bulk of the working population. As the economy slowed down, they shed millions of workers - and unemployment rose rapidly, by one percentage point every year according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. State-owned enterprises went from employing 60% of the working population in 1995 to 30% in 2002. But China recovered, and the private sector stepped in to hire young people.This time, it's different and the private sector is also under pressure, says economist George Magnus, associate at the China Centre, Oxford University. ""No one was talking about trade wars at that time. The great offshoring of manufacturing to China was underway. ""Now, the rest of the world is an economic funk - so there's no consumer demand, and nothing in terms of foreign trade. All of the headwinds that China was facing before the pandemic have been compounded by the coronavirus.""For the last 40 years, China's Communist Party has been able to promise a simple contract to its citizens: we'll keep your quality of life improving and you fall in line so that we can keep China on the right path. It is the social contract that China's leader Xi Jinping crystallised as the ""Chinese dream"" when he announced it in 2012. 2020 was meant to be a pivotal part of that grand plan - the year China would eliminate absolute poverty, raising the quality and standard of life for millions of people. But the coronavirus could be putting that social contract at risk. Arguably more than any other economic crisis in the Chinese Communist Party's history, this health crisis has become a major threat for social stability in the country. Millions of young people may not be guaranteed the same degree of success that their parents' generation has seen. Keeping that contract of wealth, employment and stability is key to the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy. Which is why economic recovery for China is so critical - and not having a growth target gives the government much needed flexibility to work out a plan. ",22 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Flexible working will be a new normal after virus,"Facebook and New Zealand's Prime Minister are the latest supporters of flexible working as companies mull back-to-office strategies.On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shift towards a more remote workforce as a long-term trend.New Zealand's PM Jacinda Ardern this week suggested a four-day working week, partly to boost tourism in the country.As offices gradually re-open after coronavirus lockdown, more employers are looking at new ways of working.Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told staff it was ""aggressively opening up remote hiring"" in July. He expects half of its workforce to do their jobs outside Facebook's offices over the next five to 10 years.It follows moves by other tech firms in Silicon Valley, including Twitter, which said employees can work from home ""forever"" if they wish.  Flexible working policies suit staff who are anxious about returning to offices while giving breathing space to companies as they introduce new social distancing measures.Ms Ardern has suggested a four-day working week to help boost the economy and address work-life balancing. ""I hear lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day work week. Ultimately that really sits between employers and employees. But as I've said there's just so much we've learnt about Covid and that flexibility of people working from home, the productivity that can be driven out of that,"" Ardern said in a Facebook live video.Tech giant Microsoft trialled a four-day working week last year in Japan which was deemed successful in terms of employee feedback and productivity. It says it now has a ""hybrid workplace strategy as worksites slowly start to open"". ""Working from home remains optional through October for most employees,"" said a Microsoft spokesperson.Both working from home and shorter working weeks have been applauded by human resources experts as an alternative to a mass return to offices.""It would also give better work-life balance for the people who need it such as part-time students, new mothers, parents who want more time with kids [or] looking after the elderly,"" said Alin Abraham, a Singapore-based consultant.""If after Covid-19 employers learn how to employ flexible workers that would be a huge battle won for human resource management,"" she added. A shift towards more remote working also allows companies to rethink their expensive office space. Mastercard said it is currently looking at consolidating some of its offices while Facebook has plans for working ""hubs"" across the US.""Post Covid-19, you can imagine many companies shrinking down their real estate and employees can just work from home. It will be an interesting proposition to see how employers can cater to different crowds,"" said Adrian Tan, of workplace IT firm PeopleStrong.A growing list of business leaders are adding their weight to working from home and more flexible working arrangements, aided by technology and video-conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet.""As we start to return to workplaces and find a new normal, alternative working patterns will also help reduce commuter traffic and with social distancing measures,"" said HR consultant Emily Draycott-Jones.

Amazon trials online food delivery in India,"Internet giant Amazon is entering the meal delivery business with a trial in four parts of India's Bengaluru.The move comes as pandemic lockdowns prompt a surge in online ordering in some places, such as the US.However in India, the two big players in the market have seen significant declines in demand.Uber Eats retreated from the country last year, selling its business to local rival Zomato in exchange for a 10% stake in the Indian start-up.Amazon has set ambitious plans for expansion in India, where it has invested some $6.5bn. Like rival Walmart, it sees significant growth potential in the fast-growing country.It had reportedly planned to launch the food business before the lockdown, but delayed after lockdowns and restrictions on sales of non-essential items came into effect.About 100 restaurants and kitchens are currently involved in the trial in Bengaluru, a tech hub in the southern part of the country. Depending on its success, Amazon hopes to offer the service across the country.""Customers have been telling us for some time that they would like to order prepared meals on Amazon in addition to shopping for other essentials,"" the firm said in a statement. ""This is particularly relevant in present times as they stay home safe. we also recognise that local businesses need all the help they can get.""Amazon, which has grown from an online bookseller into a global juggernaut with a hand in everything from groceries to cloud computing, will be challenging homegrown players Swiggy and Zomato, which currently dominate the food delivery market. They have both been hit hard by loss of business due to the pandemic.Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal this month announced that the firm, which has been expanding outside of India, would cut 13% of its workforce.In a blog post, he said as much as 40% of restaurants could close over the next six to 12 months, a sign that many of the changes ushered in by the pandemic would be permanent.""We do not foresee having enough work for all our employees,"" he said.",21 May 2020,business

They recommend wearing face masks, physical distancing of 1.5m where possible in airports and washing hands often.They stopped short of calling for social distancing on planes due to the confined space, but added that other measures should be followed at all times.Meanwhile, Heathrow Airport will start using thermal cameras to carry out temperature checks in a trial on some passengers from its Terminal 2 on Thursday.Its chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, told the BBC's Today programme that this measure was already being used in many countries around the world.

It sold 20 million pairs of shoes in the year to February 2019, two million fewer than the year before, citing ""extremely tough"" conditions on the high street.It also said it will close some of its worst-performing stores.Last year it closed its only remaining UK factory after it failed to hit its targets for making desert boots. The factory opened in 2017.The company started making shoes in the UK in 1825 but production was moved to the Far East in 2005.Prior to that, the last remaining Clarks plant in the UK - Millom in Cumbria - closed in 2006.",21 May 2020,business
Get ready for the 'holy grail' of computer graphics,"Ray tracing has always been the ""holy grail"" of computer graphics, says Jason Ronald, head of program management for the gaming console Xbox.The technique simulates a three-dimensional image by calculating each ray of light and promises stunning lighting effects with realistic reflections and shadows.The method finds where it bounces, collects information about what those objects are, then uses it to lay down a pixel and compose a scene.While the techniques have been around for a long time, ""we just haven't had processing power to deliver all of that in real time"", Mr Ronald says.In Hollywood, special effects have used ray tracing for a decade. For an important sequence, computers could churn overnight for a single frame.To do this for games in real time, you need to condense that to 1/60th of a second. Processing speed has now caught up to the task.Tech company Nvidia announced last year their latest graphics processing units (GPUs) will handle real-time ray tracing. Working with Nvidia, Microsoft developed a ray tracing update to Windows 10.Microsoft and Sony have announced their upcoming consoles, the Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5, will have ray tracing capabilities. Both of these systems are built on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) hardware.And now the tech is being incorporated into some of the world's most popular games.Minecraft, which first appeared in 2009, allows players to construct vast intricate structures. Developed by Swedish game studio Mojang, it currently is the best-selling video game in history.Minecraft's makers released an early ray-tracing version of their game on 16 April. A general release will follow near the end of the year.""It looks very different from the traditional rendering mode, and it looks better,"" says Jarred Walton, hardware editor at  PC Gamer.The big problem, he says, will be price barriers for now. ""The only way you can play it is with a PC that has a graphics card that costs at least $300 (£240),"" he says.Until now, developers used another technique called rasterisation.It first appeared in the mid-1990s, is extremely quick, and represents 3D shapes in triangles and polygons. The one nearest the viewer determines the pixel.Then, programmers have to employ tricks to simulate what lighting looks like. That includes lightmaps, which calculate the brightness of surfaces ahead of time, says Mr Ronald.But these hacks have limitations. They're static, so fall apart when you move around. For example you might zoom in on a mirror and find that your reflection has disappeared.More Technology of BusinessProgrammable shaders started appearing around 2001. They did a much better job at 3D lighting tasks but required much more computational power.""If we put all that into one game, the most amazing processor in the world would've gone just no, it's too much,"" says Ben Archard, senior rendering programmer at Malta-based 4A Games, developers behind a 2019 post-apocalyptic game called Metro Exodus.There were ways around that. If a programmer wanted to simulate the hazy light coming through fog, instead of working out all the points, they could just calculate a sample of them.  (These are called stochastic, statistical, or Monte Carlo approaches.)But with these workarounds, ""pretty quickly you lose that realism in a scene,"" observes Kasia Swica, Minecraft's senior program manager, based in Seattle.Ray tracing does better with realistic, real-time shadows, or reflections lurking in water or glass.""My favourite thing to do with ray tracing is to go underwater,"" says Miss Swica.""You get really realistic reflections and refractions, and neat shafts of light coming through as well,"" she says.With lockdowns around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic, the need for people to feel close while isolated ""is going to accelerate"" progress in technology, says Rev Lebaredian, vice president for simulation technology at Nvidia, in San Francisco.""With virtual and augmented reality, we're starting to feel like we're in the same place together,"" he says.So coronavirus will drive demand and progress, agrees Frank Azor, chief gaming solutions architect at AMD.One ""fiendish problem"" for ray tracing has involved how shaders can call on other shaders if two rays interact, says Andrew Goossen, a technical fellow at Microsoft who works on the Xbox Series X.GPUs work on problems like rays in parallel: making parallel processes talk to each other is complex.Working out technical problems for improving ray tracing will be the main tasks ""in the next five to seven years of computer graphics, at least,"" says Mr Ronald.In the meantime games companies will use other techniques to make games look slicker. Earlier this month Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite, released its latest game architecture, the Unreal Engine 5.It uses a combination of techniques, including a library of objects that can be imported into games as hundreds of millions of polygons, and a hierarchy of details treating large and small objects differently to save on its demands on processor resources.For most game makers such ""hacks and tricks"" will be good enough, says Mr Walton.",22 May 2020,business
African solutions to the coronavirus crisis,"The African continent hasn't been as badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic as other countries in the world so far, but new cases are on the rise and governments have introduced social distancing measures.And while the pandemic is bad for business, some African entrepreneurs have stepped up to be part of the solution and are seeing new opportunities. Frequent and thorough washing of hands with soap and warm water is one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. But according to Water Aid, four in 10 people around the world have no access to basic hand washing facilities. One of the ways in which the coronavirus is spread is via contaminated surfaces. Getting into the habit of regular hand washing can prevent infections, but the virus can still spread as people tend to touch the tap and other things around them.In a city like Freetown in Sierra Leone, a population of 2 million people has a water supply capacity which ideally should be used by no more than 800,000 people, according to international development consultancy firm IMC Worldwide. Water is already scarce, and now hand washing is crucial.To solve this problem, one business has developed a portable hands-free tap unit that is now being placed outside shops, banks and government buildings.The Fomel Industry and National Industrialization Centre (FINIC) usually specialises in manufacturing agriculture processing equipment and other machines.But now the firm, founded by Melvin Foday Kamara, is manufacturing a portable freestanding hands-free faucet that is operated by stepping on pedals to access soap and water on demand.Clean running water is also in short supply in Zimbabwe's capital Harare, where citizens told the BBC they are now washing their hands with washing up liquid, as they cannot afford to buy hand sanitiser.""In the area where I live, running water is very scarce, so we actually have to have buckets of water so that it's easy for us to wash our hands,"" Wadzanayi Musasa explains.""When we get home from the shops, we take off our gloves, we use dish washing liquid to wash our hands and someone will hold a jug of water [to rinse them].""Waste management and clean water provider Clean City is now distributing water around Harare's residential and commercial areas in tank trucks, so that citizens can collect extra buckets of water to ensure hygiene standards are preserved through the lockdown.The company started in 2018, in response to two cholera epidemics that hit Zimbabwe in 2008 and 2018. The firm says it realised that something had to be done to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Compared to people living in richer nations, people in developing countries are more negatively impacted by waste that isn't managed properly, which puts both human health and the environment at risk.More than 90% of waste in developing nations goes to dumpsites, according to data from the United Nations Environment Programme.Every day, Clean City also offers fumigation and decontamination services across Harare, which can be ordered using a mobile app.""We're basically driven by two principles - digital first and people first,"" says Clean City's chief executive Lovemore Nyatsine.""Everything is contactless. Our crews follow very clear processes to keep our clients and themselves safe.""One example of an industry stepping up as a result of the pandemic is the 3D printing community - tech firms, universities and 3D print enthusiasts with their own printers are responding to the shortage of healthcare workers' personal protective equipment (PPE) - and in some cases more complex hospital medical supplies - by making it themselves. Malawi has been experiencing severe shortages of PPE during the coronavirus lockdown.The shortages are due to costs of procuring the equipment, as well as disruption caused by the pandemic to global supply chains. Blantyre-based tech firm iMoSyS is one such company that is now using its 3D printers and computer assisted design (CAD) software to design reusable face masks and face shields for healthcare workers.Typically the firm focuses on providing IT and engineering services to enable the remote monitoring of industrial processes, infrastructure and patients' health.Entrepreneur Mayamiko Nkoloma, chief executive of iMoSyS, says his firm has received numerous requests from across the African continent, but also from overseas countries including the UK.""Anything is possible. We started with nothing but ideas, and we took our ideas to industries and pitched them to solve challenges,"" he tells the BBC.Despite the myriad challenges presented by the pandemic, to say nothing of the looming recession once lockdown measures are eventually lifted, some firms feel trying times are when real growth and change is possible.""As bad as the coronavirus is, it has provided the opportunity for many leaders in business and in governance to have a rethink,"" says Mr Karama of Finic in Sierra Leone. ""It is important that we leverage innovation...it is important that Africa learns to innovate, to monetise [and] not to import everything.""  ",22 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Universities fear fall in lucrative overseas students,"Which sector of the economy do you think is being hardest hit by the coronavirus - construction, retail, transport or catering?Well, you are all wrong, and need to do some more homework. The answer is - education.Many people probably don't even think of education as part of the economy. The groves of academe are surely above such sordid considerations as money and finance?Not a bit of it. Money is the lifeblood of education - endowments from wealthy alumni, catering and accommodation fees, conference facilities, and the biggest of the lot - attracting lots of fee-paying students every year. The trouble for the education sector is that it is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic.For hundreds of years its business model has been to bring thousands of people together from across the country, and around the world, to sit together in rooms for three years and talk to each other.As a result, nearly all its income streams are under attack at the same time.Current students have been sent home, and many courses have moved online. If lockdowns around the world continue, new students are going to be hard to find in the autumn, and even harder to get on campus.Plus, conferences are not happening, and all those wealthy alumni are nowhere near as wealthy as they thought they were.This hits Western English-speaking universities particularly hard. They tend to charge even domestic students large tuition fees, and make money out of on-site catering and accommodation on top of that.They also tend to charge foreign students a lot more, making them a huge source of income for many universities. In the UK, for example, undergraduate students from outside the UK and the EU can be charged annual tuition fees as high as £58,600 instead of the standard £9,000.So, while globalisation for many means importing cheaper manufactured goods from around the world, for developed economies one of their greatest recent economic successes has been attracting students from overseas.The rise of the middle classes around the world has been a godsend for Western universities, says Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at the University of Oxford.""The global middle classes have grown by leaps and bounds in recent decades, and anyone in that group can send their children abroad for education,"" he says.They have been doing just that, not least because many developing countries don't have the same quality of tertiary education as developed ones. This means that students who study abroad emerge with a prestigious degree, a second language, and lots of contacts and friends. It has proved a price worth paying for millions.The big winners in this regard have been the US, the UK and Australia. All with excellent education systems that teach in English, they can attract fee paying students from around the world.In the US, 360,000 Chinese students started the last academic year. The influx of foreign students is estimated to be worth as much as $45bn (£37bn) a year to the American economy.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:In Australia, foreign students are said to bring in more than 30bn Australian dollars a year ($20bn; £16bn), and it is a market that Australian universities have been targeting for years.Andrew Norton, professor of the practice of higher education policy at Australian National University in Canberra, says the country has been trying to attract foreign students from Asia since the 1980s.Australia has some distinct advantages for these students, he says. ""We are in much the same time zone, the climate is attractive, and there is the possibility of migrating here.""But the government in Canberra has not helped the sector very much, if at all, during this crisis. Prime Minister Scott Morrison even went as far as saying that foreign students should consider going back to their home countries if they could not support themselves during the lockdown.That message is hardly likely to encourage new students to feel welcome in future, and that matters, says Prof Norton, because ""there is a pipeline effect"".""If students don't start a degree course this year, then they are not here for three years,"" he says, meaning universities are going to be feeling the pressure of lost income for years to come, and not only in Australia.In the US the university sector is a massive business. Some of the oldest and most famous colleges have billions in reserve, massive endowments, and a reputation that means they can charge students top dollar. But even they are suffering being closed now.Many overseas students in the US are demanding rebates for lost lessons, and American universities make a small fortune from having students on site. Catering and accommodation are huge earners. Students in the UK have also been calling for refunds.Vijay Govindarajan, Coxe distinguished professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, says: ""I don't see how we can reopen and have campus classes this fall [autumn]"".Professor Marginson says that while universities have rushed to move courses online, at least temporarily, it is clear that they are not as attractive. ""Students, if given the choice, pick face-to-face teaching,"" he says. ""Online does not have the same prestige, and not just with employers, but with society as well.""In the UK, Cambridge University has announced that all its lectures will be online-only during the next academic year. However, it said it would review the situation if government guidance changed.  Colleges and universities around the world have moved rapidly towards online and remote teaching now, because they have to. When much of the world is in lockdown and social distancing is the norm, they have no choice, and it is the only way of keeping at least some money coming in.But it is not clear how many universities will survive the collapse of their income, and whether the move online will become permanent. Teaching people together on one site has proved to be a very long-lasting and successful business model, and it still carries huge prestige and rewards for those taking part.",21 May 2020,business
Oil collapse: 'Right now everything I have is shut down',"The US rose over the last decade to become the world's largest oil producer. Does the pandemic spell the industry's decline?Texas oilman Allan P Bloxsom III still remembers the taunts of ""college boy"" that greeted him on the offshore drilling rig where his father, desperate for his wayward son to shape up, sent him to work one summer.""Against my wishes I went and it changed my life,"" says Mr Bloxsom, now 63 years old and the president of Fort Apache Energy, a small company that operates oil and gas wells in Texas and Louisiana. ""I was hooked.""That was decades ago. Since then, his home state of Texas has more than doubled its crude oil output, helping to turn the US into the world's biggest oil producer.But as oil prices tumble - briefly falling below zero in a first last month - following a dramatic drop in energy demand because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the industry is going into reverse.Giants such as Exxon and Chevron and fracking firms such as Diamondback Energy have shut in wells and slashed investment in recent weeks, helping drive down US crude oil production by nearly one million barrels per day from March to April - the third largest monthly decline in a century.Mr Bloxsom cut his typical output of 800 barrels per day by more than half. Others have gone even further.""Right now everything I have is shut down. Everything,"" says Bill D Graham, president of Midland, Texas-based Incline Energy, which has 80 wells that in more typical times would about 275 barrels per day. The supply cuts are not unique to the US. The International Energy Agency expects global oil supply to fall to a nine-year low this month, as producers around the world reduce output in response to prices that dropped by more than two-thirds in April before starting to stabilise.But even before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the industry was experiencing a supply glut - driven by the US boom - that had depressed prices and prompted strains in oil-producing Texas and elsewhere. The Wall Street money that helped power the fracking growth had grown harder to come by, while big firms were promoting investments in renewable energy. Forecasters at IHS Markit say supply is unlikely to return to 2019 levels until at least 2023. There is a chance that 2019 will have been the high point for global output, should the pandemic permanently reduce energy demand - for example, by increasing telework and reducing business travel.""This is a transformational crisis for the world and what happens to oil will be shaped by the broader forces of change that are coming out of Covid-19,"" says Jim Burkhard, the firm's head of oil market research.""There's enough of these variables in play where you don't have to have a doomsday view of the world to consider that oil demand could have peaked in 2019. That's not our base case, but it is our alternative scenario.""In the US, several large US companies have already filed for bankruptcy, with more expected in a sector where debt levels were already dangerously high. Services firms, desperate to survive the crisis, have cut more than 66,000 jobs - almost 10% of total employment - with more reductions likely, the Petroleum Equipment & Services Association industry group estimates. As healthier businesses scoop up the assets of distressed rivals, the industry is likely to emerge with fewer firms and fewer workers.""The future for the small operator like me - I see it going away completely,"" says Mr Graham.Mr Graham, whose father started Incline Energy in 1966, says he managed to keep his five staff after securing government coronavirus rescue money. But if the price his oil fetches - which for now is lower than figure traded on financial markets - does not bounce back above $25 by October, those jobs are at risk.""With the wells shut in and zero income, we're just going to have to play a waiting game and see how long we can last,"" the 66-year-old says.US President Donald Trump has pledged his support for the oil industry and opened government storage facilities, so that producers do not have to sell at a loss due to lack of storage as happened in April. The Federal Reserve has also adjusted its coronavirus relief programmes to make sure energy firms qualify. But Democrats, backed by environmental groups and others concerned about fossil fuel contributions to climate change, have resisted greater assistance for the sector, pointing to already high debt levels among many firms. ""It is deplorable to send good money after bad,"" Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, wrote after the Fed's changes.Leslie Beyer, president of industry group Petroleum Equipment & Services Association, says many of her members are already working on renewables and cleaner energy technology. She calls those who hope the pandemic will spell the demise of the industry ""misguided"", noting that global population growth and economic development in poor countries will drive continuing demand for oil.""Some people who don't understand the way the industry works ... think now is the time to transition entirely to renewables. There is definitely room for renewables and we need to increase those, but we don't go zero to 60,"" she says. ""It's important that we don't give up on the ingenuity that created the shale boom. That's what put us in the great position that we're in as the world's largest producer ... We need to maintain that.""But the best days of the industry may be over, Mr Bloxsom says, pointing to the scarcity of young people at conferences.""I have told all four of my kids, 'Do not go into the oil patch,"" he says. ""Do something else.""",20 May 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Hertz: Car rental firm files for US bankruptcy protection,"Car rental company Hertz has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after the pandemic saw its business plummet.The firm, which earns much of its income from car rentals at airports, said it had been affected by the sharp downturn in global travel.It will continue to operate while restructuring its debts.Hertz's international operations in Europe, Australia and New Zealand as well as its franchised locations in the US are not affected.The company - which began operating a century ago in Chicago with a dozen Model T Ford cars - had already furloughed or laid off 20,000 employees, or around half of its global workforce, in response to the pandemic.Its chief executive resigned last week.Before the pandemic the company had amassed billions of dollars in debt, with the rise of ride-hailing apps leading to a drop in demand for car rentals.""The impact of Covid-19 on travel demand was sudden and dramatic, causing an abrupt decline in the company's revenue and future bookings,"" Hertz said on Friday.While it had taken ""immediate actions to prioritize the health and safety of employees and customers, eliminate all non-essential spending and preserve liquidity"", the uncertainty over if and when the market would recover led to its decision, it said.",23 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: The shops refusing to pay their rent,"Andrea Orsini's family has run M Bar in London's Leadenhall Market for 40 years.  But after shutting up shop because of the lockdown, he says he can't afford his next rent bill.He pays £70,000 a year to his landlord. On top of that, he must also fund a service charge, business rates and a tables and chairs license. It all adds up to £125,000 which, as he puts it, is a lot of tea and coffee.  Round the corner, Patrick Dudley Williams, who runs the clothing brand Reef Knots, is in a similar position. He said it would not be sustainable to borrow money to fund rent for his shop, which is currently closed and in a part of the city that is unlikely to see customers return for some time.Their landlord, the City of London Corporation, says it is aware of the difficulties faced by businesses in Leadenhall Market.The corporation, which is the local council for the Square Mile, said it has offered three month rent deferrals to selected tenants, adding that it was considering further support.A similar story is being told up and down the country. This weekend, Cheltenham publican Ed Anderson handed over his pubs' keys to his local MP to highlight the difficulties that businesses are facing paying rent while they are closed. He says rent bills will ""break"" the hospitality sector and he's encouraging other business owners to join his campaign Keys2MPs. Since the lockdown, non-payment of commercial rent has become widespreadMichael Old, a partner at EY, said the biggest drop in rent collections had been in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors.He said retail landlords had collected less than half of rent due in March. ""This compares to 66% in the office sector and 83% in the industrial sector,"" he said.He expects to see a further decline in rent collection levels in June. And that's a major problem for landlords who have their own financial obligations.The Coronavirus Act has temporarily banned landlords from evicting tenants if they don't pay their rent. In the more constructive cases, landlords are deferring rent payments or changing them to monthly instalments - sometimes in arrears.Nick Ridley from Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm, says landlords have been taking a harder stance when they think companies are using the crisis as an excuse not to pay - especially when it comes to larger chains and companies such as pharmacies that have remained open.  ""My investment fund clients are starting to weed out the genuine hardship payments from the opportunistic tenants,"" he said.Lawyer Vicky Khandker, who works at Lodders, says landlords and tenants need to work together to address the issue of where the rent bill should land. ""Ultimately, landlords don't want to find that, at the end of this, they've suddenly got a lot of their tenants that simply no longer exist and haven't survived - because they'll be left with a glut of empty properties"". Companies are complaining that some landlords are unwilling to engage. The owners of pub and brewer BrewDog say that, of their 60 UK landlords, a third have not been willing to communicate and ""less than 10% have done anything that offers meaningful help so far"".  Large chains such as Burger King UK are refusing to pay their rent until they are properly back in business. This has resulted in a couple of winding up orders, but they have otherwise had a constructive dialogue with their many landlords. When it comes to the landlord-tenant relationship, there's no one size fits all model. While the tenant may be the most visual victim of a demand for rent - that's not always the case.Professor Andrew Baum from the University of Oxford explains that landlords are not always the more powerful party in the relationship. ""The landlord of a property might be a pension fund paying the elderly, and the tenant could be a private equity-owned business,"" he said.Ms Khandker agrees. ""In some cases, landlords may be much smaller businesses than the tenants that occupy their premises, so the landlords may be left in a much more severe position than the tenants are,"" she said.The government says it recognises the huge challenges being faced by commercial tenants and landlords during this period. ""We're working closely with them to ensure they are supported and would urge landlords and tenants to follow the example of others and find solutions that work for both parties,"" it said.Hospitality businesses, led by restaurateur Jonathan Downey, are running a campaign called National Time Out, calling for a nine-month rent holiday, meaning leases are extended and payments postponed to the end of the tenancy.  The retail property association Revo, in conjunction with the British Retail Consortium and the British Property Federation, would like to see a ""Furloughed Space Grant Scheme"", effectively calling on government to underwrite rents for stores that are closed. Vivienne King, chief executive of Revo estimates around a third of rent was paid for the second quarter of the year.""In the majority of cases retailers and property owners are working together to navigate this crisis,"" she said.""However, the flexibility shown by both sides is not sustainable in the longer term, and there is a real risk the ecosystem built upon on thriving occupiers could collapse unless there is direct financial support from government."" Professor Baum does not believe this is a viable solution. ""It would be such a dangerous game to play - what happens to a retailer paying dividends but not their rent,"" he asks.""What about future profits? And why haven't businesses saved for a rainy day?""Until then, it is up to landlords and tenants to make their own arrangements about where the bill should fall. ",22 May 2020,business
African solutions to the coronavirus crisis,"The African continent hasn't been as badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic as other countries in the world so far, but new cases are on the rise and governments have introduced social distancing measures.And while the pandemic is bad for business, some African entrepreneurs have stepped up to be part of the solution and are seeing new opportunities. Frequent and thorough washing of hands with soap and warm water is one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. But according to Water Aid, four in 10 people around the world have no access to basic hand washing facilities. One of the ways in which the coronavirus is spread is via contaminated surfaces. Getting into the habit of regular hand washing can prevent infections, but the virus can still spread as people tend to touch the tap and other things around them.In a city like Freetown in Sierra Leone, a population of 2 million people has a water supply capacity which ideally should be used by no more than 800,000 people, according to international development consultancy firm IMC Worldwide. Water is already scarce, and now hand washing is crucial.To solve this problem, one business has developed a portable hands-free tap unit that is now being placed outside shops, banks and government buildings.The Fomel Industry and National Industrialization Centre (FINIC) usually specialises in manufacturing agriculture processing equipment and other machines.But now the firm, founded by Melvin Foday Kamara, is manufacturing a portable freestanding hands-free faucet that is operated by stepping on pedals to access soap and water on demand.Clean running water is also in short supply in Zimbabwe's capital Harare, where citizens told the BBC they are now washing their hands with washing up liquid, as they cannot afford to buy hand sanitiser.""In the area where I live, running water is very scarce, so we actually have to have buckets of water so that it's easy for us to wash our hands,"" Wadzanayi Musasa explains.""When we get home from the shops, we take off our gloves, we use dish washing liquid to wash our hands and someone will hold a jug of water [to rinse them].""Waste management and clean water provider Clean City is now distributing water around Harare's residential and commercial areas in tank trucks, so that citizens can collect extra buckets of water to ensure hygiene standards are preserved through the lockdown.The company started in 2018, in response to two cholera epidemics that hit Zimbabwe in 2008 and 2018. The firm says it realised that something had to be done to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Compared to people living in richer nations, people in developing countries are more negatively impacted by waste that isn't managed properly, which puts both human health and the environment at risk.More than 90% of waste in developing nations goes to dumpsites, according to data from the United Nations Environment Programme.Every day, Clean City also offers fumigation and decontamination services across Harare, which can be ordered using a mobile app.""We're basically driven by two principles - digital first and people first,"" says Clean City's chief executive Lovemore Nyatsine.""Everything is contactless. Our crews follow very clear processes to keep our clients and themselves safe.""One example of an industry stepping up as a result of the pandemic is the 3D printing community - tech firms, universities and 3D print enthusiasts with their own printers are responding to the shortage of healthcare workers' personal protective equipment (PPE) - and in some cases more complex hospital medical supplies - by making it themselves. Malawi has been experiencing severe shortages of PPE during the coronavirus lockdown.The shortages are due to costs of procuring the equipment, as well as disruption caused by the pandemic to global supply chains. Blantyre-based tech firm iMoSyS is one such company that is now using its 3D printers and computer assisted design (CAD) software to design reusable face masks and face shields for healthcare workers.Typically the firm focuses on providing IT and engineering services to enable the remote monitoring of industrial processes, infrastructure and patients' health.Entrepreneur Mayamiko Nkoloma, chief executive of iMoSyS, says his firm has received numerous requests from across the African continent, but also from overseas countries including the UK.""Anything is possible. We started with nothing but ideas, and we took our ideas to industries and pitched them to solve challenges,"" he tells the BBC.Despite the myriad challenges presented by the pandemic, to say nothing of the looming recession once lockdown measures are eventually lifted, some firms feel trying times are when real growth and change is possible.""As bad as the coronavirus is, it has provided the opportunity for many leaders in business and in governance to have a rethink,"" says Mr Karama of Finic in Sierra Leone. ""It is important that we leverage innovation...it is important that Africa learns to innovate, to monetise [and] not to import everything.""  ",22 May 2020,business
