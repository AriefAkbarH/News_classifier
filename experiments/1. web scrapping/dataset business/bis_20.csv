Eurozone in fresh emergency action to boost economy,"The European Central Bank has taken further dramatic measures try to boost the eurozone economies, amid their biggest recession since World War Two.Just months after emergency measures, the central bank said it would increase the size of its bond buying programme by €600bn (£546bn) to €1.35tn.The programme will run until June 2021, six months longer than planned.The move will keep borrowing costs low for countries and firms as they face huge budget deficits and recessions.The purchases support ""funding conditions in the real economy, especially for businesses and households,"" the ECB said.The central bank also decided to hold its interest rates at record lows.The extra bond buying ""is likely to push European government bond yields even further into negative territory, and investors in search of positive returns will be forced to take more risk,"" said Rachel Winter, associate investment director at investment firm Killik & Co.The bond purchases are often referred to as Quantitative Easing (QE).

German stimulus package hands families €300 for each child,"Germany's coalition government has agreed a €130bn (£114bn) fiscal stimulus package which cuts tax and hands €300 per child to every family.The move is designed to kick-start the economy which has been severely hit by the coronavirus crisis.Germany is heading for its worst recession in 70 years with GDP expected to shrink 6.3% this year.""We must now succeed in boosting the economy,"" said Chancellor Angela Merkel.She said the fact that Germany had seven million temporarily furloughed workers ""shows how fragile the situation is"".As well as a cut in VAT and cash for families with children, the measures include new incentives for buying electric cars.The package was announced late on Wednesday after 21 hours of negotiations between the partners in Mrs Merkel's governing grand coalition - which comprises her own Christian Democratic Union, its Bavarian sister party the CSU, and the left-of-centre Social Democrats.To boost consumer spending, VAT will be cut from 19% to 16% from 1 July to 31 December this year, a move that will cost the German government €20bn alone.Families will receive a one-time transfer of €300 for each child.Meanwhile those who buy electric cars will see the government rebate - an incentive designed to encourage consumers to switch to cleaner vehicles - doubled to €6,000.Businesses will benefit too. Companies in sectors hardest hit by the crisis - such as hospitality, tourism and entertainment - will receive ""bridging help"" worth €25bn from June to August.Restaurants, hotels or event management companies could get up to 80% of their fixed operating costs reimbursed if their revenues have plunged more than 70% compared to a year ago.The new stimulus package comes on top of a €1.1 trillion rescue package agreed in March, which comprised loan guarantees, subsidies and a shorter-hours programme to avoid job cuts.Mrs Merkel said the support programme would help ""the economy to find its feet and grow again"".",4 June 2020,business
HSBC and StanChart back China security laws for HK,"HSBC and Standard Chartered have given their backing to China's new security laws for Hong Kong.Both banks made statements saying the proposed law can help maintain long-term stability in the troubled city.On Wednesday, HSBC's Asia Pacific chief executive Peter Wong signed a petition backing the law which has been widely criticised.But this backing comes as Japanese bank Nomura said it was ""seriously"" examining its presence in Hong Kong.It is unusual for a bank to enter into political debate, particularly one as controversial as China's new security laws which many feel could mark the end of Hong Kong's unique freedoms.HSBC's statement noted that the Hong Kong Association of Banks had already issued a statement saying the law would contribute to a stable business environment. Although it is Europe's largest bank, HSBC has a strong presence in Asia, particularly Hong Kong. HSBC ""respects and supports all laws that stabilise Hong Kong's social order,"" it said in a post on social media in China.The bank's full name is the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and it has its origins in the former British colony. While HSBC moved its headquarters to London in 1993, Hong Kong is still its biggest market. Standard Chartered also has a strong presence in Asia. ""We believe the national security law can help maintain the long-term economic and social stability of Hong Kong,"" it said in a statement. It added that ""the 'one country, two systems' principle is core to the future success of Hong Kong and has always been the bedrock of the business community's confidence"". Meanwhile, Japanese investment bank Nomura said it was reviewing the scale of its operations in Hong Kong. The bank's chief executive, Kentaro Okuda, said that while Hong Kong remained its most critical Asian hub outside Japan, the situation now was ""not the same as it used to be"" in an interview with the FT.While the details are still being fleshed out, the new security laws would make criminal any act of:Hong Kong residents are concerned this will affect free speech and their right to protest.

Louis Vuitton casts doubt over $16bn Tiffany takeover,"The world's biggest luxury goods firm, LVMH, has cast doubt over its planned $16bn (£12.5bn) takeover of US-based jeweller Tiffany.LVMH agreed to acquire Tiffany last November, but coronavirus-induced turmoil on financial markets has overshadowed the deal.After days of speculation, LVMH said on Thursday that it would not buy Tiffany shares on the open market.It could be a sign that LVMH wants to renegotiate a cheaper price.Tiffany's share price tumbled in March on the back of expectation that sales of its luxury jewellery would fall. Although the stock recovered, it has fallen again this week on speculation LVMH's bid was in doubt.LVMH's billionaire chief executive Bernard Arnault has long coveted buying Tiffany, a brand that hit global fame in the Audrey Hepburn romance Breakfast at Tiffany's.He agreed to pay $135 a share, but the price has sunk to about $114 a share. LVMH's statement on Thursday comes ahead of Tiffany's quarterly results, due out next week.LVMH said that during its board meeting on Tuesday, the firm ""notably focused its attention on the development of the pandemic and its potential impact on the results and perspectives of Tiffany & Co with respect to the agreement that links the two groups"".It added: ""Considering the recent market rumours, LVMH confirms, on this occasion, that it is not considering buying Tiffany shares on the market.""It gave no further details.Tiffany is something of a New York institution and its flagship store is next to Trump Tower on 5th Avenue.Founded in 1837, it employs more than 14,000 people and operates about 300 stores - 12 of them in the UK. LVMH has 75 brands, 156,000 employees and a network of more than 4,590 stores. Its brands include Louis Vuitton, Kenzo, Tag Heuer, Dom Pérignon, Moet & Chandon and Christian Dior.

US bars passenger flights from China,"The US is barring passenger flights from China from 16 June, in the latest sign of tensions between the two economic giants.The Department of Transportation said it is punishing Beijing for refusing to let US airlines resume flights to China as its pandemic subsides. In recent weeks the countries have sparred over coronavirus and China's policies in Hong Kong.But Washington said it would continue to ""engage"" on the air travel issue.The Department of Transportation order applies to four airlines - Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines - which have continued to fly between the two countries during the pandemic, although at reduced levels.It needs final approval from US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly accused China of engaging in unfair trade, and in recent weeks criticised its handling of coronavirus and protests in Hong Kong.The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately comment. Officials have previously said its restrictions, which were introduced to control coronavirus, were fair since they apply to all airlines.Beijing in March said domestic and foreign airlines could operate no more than one weekly flight between China and any given country, adding that carriers could not exceed the level of service they were offering on 12 March.The Department of Transportation said the March order had effectively banned US airlines, which had voluntarily suspended service between the two countries in February due to the pandemic and Mr Trump's order barring entry to the US for most Chinese travellers.It said the refusal to grant requests by US airlines to resume service this month violated the agreement governing air travel between the two countries, which dates back to 1980.""We conclude that these circumstances require the Department's action to restore a competitive balance and fair and equal opportunity among US and Chinese air carriers,"" the Department of Transportation said. ""Our overriding goal is not the perpetuation of this situation but rather an improved environment.""If the order goes forward, it will hurt travel, trade and other exchange between the two countries, said Daniel Kliman, director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. But that breakdown was already under way, he added.""We're already seeing de-coupling of the United States and China,"" he said, pointing to US efforts to restrict technology sales and the US-China trade war. ""It's an acceleration of a trend that has really been building up.""In recent weeks, China has moved to loosen restrictions on charter flights from some countries but not the US, according to a report last month in the Community Party's Global Times. Officials told the newspaper the government would also consider increasing general flights, pending better control of the outbreak.Mr Kliman said there is some chance the two countries could resolve the matter before 16 June - but once the US ban goes into effect it will be hard to undo.In January, there were about 325 round-trip flights weekly between the US and China. Those have numbered around 34 since the end of March, the US said.Delta Airlines, one of the companies that had sought to resume flights this month, said it welcomed the US order.""We support and appreciate the US government's actions to enforce our rights and ensure fairness,"" it said.The US China Business Council, which represents 200 big US companies that do business in China, said: ""Commercial air travel provides a vital bridge between the US and China.  Prior to the pandemic, millions of travellers crossed the ocean each year to conduct business, enjoy holidays, study and, most important, learn about the other through direct experience.  ""This travel is especially important during times of conflict, suspicion and misunderstanding. We call on the governments of both countries to get the airplanes flying again - in both directions.""

Thousand of cinemas in China under threat of closure,"More than 40% of cinemas in China could go bust, according to a bleak report by the China Film Association.Having been temporary closed during the virus pandemic, audiences may struggle to return, the association says.Millions of Chinese have enjoyed watching movies online during cinema closures thanks to a wide range of streaming services.As a result, thousands could shut permanently in a ""massive bloodbath"" predicts one Chinese business expert.There are now more than 12,000 cinemas in China, according to market research firm IBISWorld. This figure has more than doubled in the past decade as China has embraced movie-going. But four out of 10 said they ""are very likely to close"" in the near future, according to the China Film Association survey. This could mean nearly 5,000 cinemas going bust as a result of the pandemic. Cinemas have been among the last venues to reopen in China as lockdown measures are gradually lifted. The Chinese government said that cinemas, along with other indoor entertainment venues, could reopen with limited bookings. In the first quarter of 2020, China's box office takings have fallen significantly, according to the film association. Small cinemas with fewer than 500 seats suffered the most, with revenues only reaching 10% of those taken during the same period last year.If cinema re-openings are delayed until October, annual revenues would plunge by 91% across the board, the association predicts.  Last year, China generated 64.2bn yuan (£7.2bn) from movie ticket sales as millions flocked to cinemas.Shaun Rein, founder of the China Market Research Group, believes a major challenge will be the growing strength of China's online movie sector, which is hugely competitive with platforms such as Iqiyi, Youkou and Tencent Video. He said subscriptions were cheap at around $2 a month for a basic package, while movie tickets often sell for $20.""Chinese players are just so cheap, often because they are subsidised as they are owned by giant internet players like Alibaba, Baidu or Tencent,"" he said.""Aside from fears over catching Covid-19, consumers won't go back to cinemas anytime soon as the digital offerings are too good and cheap,""He also predicted more pain for cinemas if film companies start to launch direct-to-digital offerings and charge higher prices for online movie releases on a pay-as-you-go basic on top of subscription rates. ""I expect the cinema sector to face a massive bloodbath and many will go out of business,"" he added.Another challenge is getting people back into cinemas due to the lack of new films, with production curtailed due to travel and social restrictions. ""We hear about 20% of local productions have begun or resumed physical work, with the balance postponed or in financial difficulty related to the Covid-19 outbreak,"" said Rance Pow, chief executive of Artisan Gateway, an Asian film industry consultant.""So that complicates the timing and recovery of cinemas as well; 'must see' films will be needed like never before to bolster the industry recovery"". Some have warned that China's film industry will lose up to 30bn yuan this year, including the National Film Administration, a government body.Others are less pessimistic about the fortunes of China's cinemas. ""The predictions are dire, but I'm more optimistic,"" said Chris Fenton, a former motion picture president and author of Feeding the Dragon. He points to the Chinese government's desire to have a world-class film industry and largest market in the world.""Plus the Chinese have embraced movie-going into the cultural fabric of society. It's a habit they are rabid about. That urge to visit cinemas regularly has not waned"".",4 June 2020,business

Louis Vuitton casts doubt over $16bn Tiffany takeover,"The world's biggest luxury goods firm, LVMH, has cast doubt over its planned $16bn (£12.5bn) takeover of US-based jeweller Tiffany.LVMH agreed to acquire Tiffany last November, but coronavirus-induced turmoil on financial markets has overshadowed the deal.After days of speculation, LVMH said on Thursday that it would not buy Tiffany shares on the open market.It could be a sign that LVMH wants to renegotiate a cheaper price.Tiffany's share price tumbled in March on the back of expectation that sales of its luxury jewellery would fall. Although the stock recovered, it has fallen again this week on speculation LVMH's bid was in doubt.LVMH's billionaire chief executive Bernard Arnault has long coveted buying Tiffany, a brand that hit global fame in the Audrey Hepburn romance Breakfast at Tiffany's.He agreed to pay $135 a share, but the price has sunk to about $114 a share.

US bars passenger flights from China,"The US is barring passenger flights from China from 16 June, in the latest sign of tensions between the two economic giants.The Department of Transportation said it is punishing Beijing for refusing to let US airlines resume flights to China as its pandemic subsides. In recent weeks the countries have sparred over coronavirus and China's policies in Hong Kong.But Washington said it would continue to ""engage"" on the air travel issue.The Department of Transportation order applies to four airlines - Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines - which have continued to fly between the two countries during the pandemic, although at reduced levels.It needs final approval from US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly accused China of engaging in unfair trade, and in recent weeks criticised its handling of coronavirus and protests in Hong Kong.The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately comment. Officials have previously said its restrictions, which were introduced to control coronavirus, were fair since they apply to all airlines.Beijing in March said domestic and foreign airlines could operate no more than one weekly flight between China and any given country, adding that carriers could not exceed the level of service they were offering on 12 March.The Department of Transportation said the March order had effectively banned US airlines, which had voluntarily suspended service between the two countries in February due to the pandemic and Mr Trump's order barring entry to the US for most Chinese travellers.It said the refusal to grant requests by US airlines to resume service this month violated the agreement governing air travel between the two countries, which dates back to 1980.""We conclude that these circumstances require the Department's action to restore a competitive balance and fair and equal opportunity among US and Chinese air carriers,"" the Department of Transportation said. ""Our overriding goal is not the perpetuation of this situation but rather an improved environment.""If the order goes forward, it will hurt travel, trade and other exchange between the two countries, said Daniel Kliman, director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. But that breakdown was already under way, he added.""We're already seeing de-coupling of the United States and China,"" he said, pointing to US efforts to restrict technology sales and the US-China trade war. ""It's an acceleration of a trend that has really been building up.""In recent weeks, China has moved to loosen restrictions on charter flights from some countries but not the US, according to a report last month in the Community Party's Global Times. Officials told the newspaper the government would also consider increasing general flights, pending better control of the outbreak.Mr Kliman said there is some chance the two countries could resolve the matter before 16 June - but once the US ban goes into effect it will be hard to undo.In January, there were about 325 round-trip flights weekly between the US and China. Those have numbered around 34 since the end of March, the US said.Delta Airlines, one of the companies that had sought to resume flights this month, said it welcomed the US order.""We support and appreciate the US government's actions to enforce our rights and ensure fairness,"" it said.The US China Business Council, which represents 200 big US companies that do business in China, said: ""Commercial air travel provides a vital bridge between the US and China.  Prior to the pandemic, millions of travellers crossed the ocean each year to conduct business, enjoy holidays, study and, most important, learn about the other through direct experience.  ""This travel is especially important during times of conflict, suspicion and misunderstanding. We call on the governments of both countries to get the airplanes flying again - in both directions.""

Thousand of cinemas in China under threat of closure,"More than 40% of cinemas in China could go bust, according to a bleak report by the China Film Association.Having been temporary closed during the virus pandemic, audiences may struggle to return, the association says.Millions of Chinese have enjoyed watching movies online during cinema closures thanks to a wide range of streaming services.As a result, thousands could shut permanently in a ""massive bloodbath"" predicts one Chinese business expert.There are now more than 12,000 cinemas in China, according to market research firm IBISWorld. This figure has more than doubled in the past decade as China has embraced movie-going. But four out of 10 said they ""are very likely to close"" in the near future, according to the China Film Association survey. This could mean nearly 5,000 cinemas going bust as a result of the pandemic. Cinemas have been among the last venues to reopen in China as lockdown measures are gradually lifted. The Chinese government said that cinemas, along with other indoor entertainment venues, could reopen with limited bookings. In the first quarter of 2020, China's box office takings have fallen significantly, according to the film association. Small cinemas with fewer than 500 seats suffered the most, with revenues only reaching 10% of those taken during the same period last year.If cinema re-openings are delayed until October, annual revenues would plunge by 91% across the board, the association predicts.  Last year, China generated 64.2bn yuan (£7.2bn) from movie ticket sales as millions flocked to cinemas.Shaun Rein, founder of the China Market Research Group, believes a major challenge will be the growing strength of China's online movie sector, which is hugely competitive with platforms such as Iqiyi, Youkou and Tencent Video. He said subscriptions were cheap at around $2 a month for a basic package, while movie tickets often sell for $20.""Chinese players are just so cheap, often because they are subsidised as they are owned by giant internet players like Alibaba, Baidu or Tencent,"" he said.""Aside from fears over catching Covid-19, consumers won't go back to cinemas anytime soon as the digital offerings are too good and cheap,""He also predicted more pain for cinemas if film companies start to launch direct-to-digital offerings and charge higher prices for online movie releases on a pay-as-you-go basic on top of subscription rates. ""I expect the cinema sector to face a massive bloodbath and many will go out of business,"" he added.Another challenge is getting people back into cinemas due to the lack of new films, with production curtailed due to travel and social restrictions. ""We hear about 20% of local productions have begun or resumed physical work, with the balance postponed or in financial difficulty related to the Covid-19 outbreak,"" said Rance Pow, chief executive of Artisan Gateway, an Asian film industry consultant.""So that complicates the timing and recovery of cinemas as well; 'must see' films will be needed like never before to bolster the industry recovery"". Some have warned that China's film industry will lose up to 30bn yuan this year, including the National Film Administration, a government body.Others are less pessimistic about the fortunes of China's cinemas. ""The predictions are dire, but I'm more optimistic,"" said Chris Fenton, a former motion picture president and author of Feeding the Dragon. He points to the Chinese government's desire to have a world-class film industry and largest market in the world.""Plus the Chinese have embraced movie-going into the cultural fabric of society.

German stimulus package hands families €300 for each child,"Germany's coalition government has agreed a €130bn (£114bn) fiscal stimulus package which cuts tax and hands €300 per child to every family.The move is designed to kick-start the economy which has been severely hit by the coronavirus crisis.Germany is heading for its worst recession in 70 years with GDP expected to shrink 6.3% this year.""We must now succeed in boosting the economy,"" said Chancellor Angela Merkel.She said the fact that Germany had seven million temporarily furloughed workers ""shows how fragile the situation is"".As well as a cut in VAT and cash for families with children, the measures include new incentives for buying electric cars.The package was announced late on Wednesday after 21 hours of negotiations between the partners in Mrs Merkel's governing grand coalition - which comprises her own Christian Democratic Union, its Bavarian sister party the CSU, and the left-of-centre Social Democrats.To boost consumer spending, VAT will be cut from 19% to 16% from 1 July to 31 December this year, a move that will cost the German government €20bn alone.Families will receive a one-time transfer of €300 for each child.Meanwhile those who buy electric cars will see the government rebate - an incentive designed to encourage consumers to switch to cleaner vehicles - doubled to €6,000.Businesses will benefit too. Companies in sectors hardest hit by the crisis - such as hospitality, tourism and entertainment - will receive ""bridging help"" worth €25bn from June to August.Restaurants, hotels or event management companies could get up to 80% of their fixed operating costs reimbursed if their revenues have plunged more than 70% compared to a year ago.The new stimulus package comes on top of a €1.1 trillion rescue package agreed in March, which comprised loan guarantees, subsidies and a shorter-hours programme to avoid job cuts.Mrs Merkel said the support programme would help ""the economy to find its feet and grow again"".",4 June 2020,business

George Floyd: SoftBank launches $100m minorities startup fund,"Japan's SoftBank is the latest major company to respond to the protests over the death of George Floyd.The technology giant has launched a $100m (£80m) fund that will invest in companies led by ""people of colour"". It comes as executives of firms including Twitter, Bank of America and General Motors have spoken out over racial inequality.George Floyd's death has sparked huge protests against racism and police brutality across the US and globally.Announcing the ""Opportunity Growth Fund"" on Twitter, SoftBank's founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son wrote “Racism is a lamentable thing,” ending his post with ""#BlackLivesMatter"".In a letter to employees the company's chief operating officer Marcelo Claure said the fund, which he will lead, aims to invest in entrepreneurs “from communities that face systemic disadvantages in building and scaling their businesses.”SoftBank also runs the $100bn Vision Fund which invests in startups around the world.Meanwhile, Twitter's Jack Dorsey has become the latest chief executive of a major US technology company to give financial support to an anti-racism organisation.He tweeted that he was making a $3m donation to former NFL player Colin Kaepernick’s Know Your Rights Camp to ""advance the liberation and well-being"" of minority communities.Mr Kaepernick is best known for kneeling during the US national anthem when he was a player for the San Francisco 49ers to protest against police killings of African-Americans.His protests were heavily criticised by conservative figures including President Donald Trump.In recent days some of the biggest corporations in the US have pledged to take action in support of racial equality.On Tuesday Bank of America said it would donate $1bn over the next four years to community programmes and small businesses to help address economic and racial inequality.In a media release chief executive Brian Moynihan said that ""underlying economic and social disparities"" had been made worse by the coronavirus pandemic and the ""events of the past week have created a sense of true urgency"".Car making giants General Motors and Ford has also condemned racial inequalityIn a letter to employees, dealers and suppliers, General Motors' chief executive Mary Barra wrote that she was “impatient and disgusted” and emphasised the need to “individually and collectively” drive change.Ford’s executive chairman, Bill Ford, and chief executive Jim Hackett also wrote a joint letter to their workers addressing the “tragic killing of George Floyd” and America’s “systemic racism.”Many other US companies, including Intel, Netflix, Nike and Facebook, have also spoken out about discrimination against African-Americans.",4 June 2020,business
"Coronavirus: 'I may lose it all, but there’s no help for me'","Layla Barnes is one among many thousands of small business owners left financially and emotionally devastated by more than 10 weeks of government-imposed lockdown. She was forced to close her Doncaster-based beauty therapy and training business which was profitable in February before lockdown began. Yet the government's excluded Layla, 30, and her limited company from any form of crisis-related support, forcing her on to benefits of £408 per month.She's moved out of her rented home, unable to meet her rent and bills, running up thousands of pounds in credit card debt to try and preserve her business. ""If I lose my business, I've lost everything. I'd spent all my life's savings - about £60,000 - on equipment and machines. ""I would rather lose my home than lose my business. So I moved in with mum and dad and me and my husband are now in the same box-room I moved out from aged 17.""As a result, she is under a huge amount of stress which has rekindled a previously diagnosed mental health disorder and made her feel this is ""the worst time I've been through in my life - worse than anything from before."" And she is not alone. Research published on Thursday by accountants serving 61,000 small businesses across the country supports concerns that the shutdown is taking its toll on their clients' mental health. Nearly three quarters - 73% - report that clients are struggling to sleep. 67% reported worsened mental health and 50% that their clients had shared feelings of not being able to cope, according to the SME Health Tracker published by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.In earlier research on 21 May, 11% of accountants reported that clients had discussed thoughts of taking their own lives. Before the shutdown in September 2019, Layla did what successive governments have created tax arrangements to encourage - branching out on her own and setting up her own business as a limited company.""I left a highly paid full-time employed job in Harley Street, training doctors and nurses in aesthetics and botox, to pursue my dream and open my own training academy. I starting doing well in February and moved into profit,"" Layla told the BBC.  ""I had paid myself £500 since September in wages as everything I earned I put back into my business.""But she had to suspend her business when the lockdown happened.""I had £20,000 of courses booked for March that I've had to refund. I've had others that I can't refund simply because the money isn't there. ""Like an estimated 710,000 other owner-managers of small businesses, Layla was excluded from financial support in a deliberate decision by the government.  She is not eligible for the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme because, after taking an accountant's advice, she had set up a limited company, paying herself a basic salary of £500 per month and any further income in the form of dividends paid to her by the Limited Company. Neither the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (the ""furlough scheme"") nor the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, covers her. Her business occupied shared office space - so it was the owner of the building, rather than her firm, that was on the business rates register and therefore received the grants meant to help companies hit by the lockdown. Neither could she receive payment holidays because her landlord was commercial not residential. ""I was rejected for the Bounce Back Loan so I'm now on universal credit at £408.99 per month. It's impossible to pay rent and bills.""I've put most of the last 10 weeks on credit cards which are now almost maxed out and I have sold some business and personal belongings including my car and my engagement ring,"" Layla told the BBC.  ""I've been told there's a possibility of going back in July. However, I'm not sure the company will survive till then and the credit I have borrowed is personal credit... therefore if the company goes bust I'm still thousands in debt for something that isn't my fault."" She added: ""I'm not saying corona is anyone's fault. But I feel really bitter than I've been told I can't work - yet no one will support me. Even if I manage to survive until July it will be a long time before I can clear the vast debts I have accumulated.""Layla told me her mental health disorder had been diagnosed in 2010 but she had recovered and was ""really doing well"". But in recent weeks she has had to have crisis meetings with a community psychiatric nurse. ""People don't understand; it's so frustrating. For people on furlough, it's almost like everyone's had a three months holiday. No-one will listen. ""I've emailed [the Chancellor] Rishi Sunak seven or eight times. I don't even get an automated reply. I emailed the council - no-one's got back to me.""Mr Sunak excluded company owners paying themselves in dividends from support during shutdown. The Treasury said the reason was that it couldn't distinguish on self-assessment forms between dividends paid to owner-managers such as Layla, and dividends paid to investors. However, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants disputes this, saying accountants could certify that dividends were being paid in lieu of salary and this could be verified by accountants and cross-checked with real-time information submitted by accountants to HMRC.Owner-managers can furlough themselves for the PAYE portion of their salaries, but for many paying themselves the typical minimum of £500 per month this would be little more than benefits. It would also make it illegal for them to do any work to conserve their business. Many small business owners have furloughed employees but have little or no income for themselves.Layla turned for support to the online campaign group ExcludedUK, a non-profit organisation whose mission is to campaign for three million UK taxpayers excluded from the government support schemes.Rachel Flower, speaking on behalf of ExcludedUK, said: ""There are a lot of women and men within our group who have been broken by what's happened.  ""They can't understand why they've been told they can't have any support when others doing the same job have been fully supported - just because they were set up as a limited company. ""Most of them say 'I just thought I was self-employed and did what I was told to do'. And after being told that no-one would be forgotten and everyone would be helped it's a real kick in the teeth.""The BBC has contacted the Treasury for a comment. ",4 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Ex-chancellors warn of severe unemployment ahead,"As the UK begins to ease lockdown restrictions, three former UK chancellors have been quizzed by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee about the effects of coronavirus on the UK economy.Alistair Darling, George Osborne and Philip Hammond were asked about the severity of the crisis versus the 2008-2009 financial crash; what measures could revive the economy; and whether taxes should increase to help pay the UK's mounting debts. They also suggested that unemployment could reach levels not seen since the 1980s.Alistair Darling: ""They are very different and this one [coronavirus], in my view, is much more serious.""The key difference between then and now is that from day one, the government wanted to get the economy going again, and therefore we introduced a range of measures, which enabled us to do that.""The situation today is different, in that firstly, it is part of government policy right across the world, and rightly so, to actually suppress economic activity through the lockdown and other measures... Unless and until the government gets control of the virus itself and the spread of the virus, it's difficult to see how you can pull out the stops and get the economy going again.""George Osborne: ""I am more optimistic, I think, than Alistair. If you look at the history of pandemics and plagues and the like in our society, then the economic bounceback is going to be relatively rapid.""If you look at the history of banking crises throughout our history, not just the one 10 years ago, but in the 1920s and 30s and in the 19th Century and before, recoveries are very slow and protracted and painful, because the credit channels of the economy are impaired, and despite all the work that Alistair did, and I did, to try and unclog those channels, it takes a long time for the allocation of capital to get to the efficiency it has before the banking crash.""Philip Hammond: ""In terms of which is the worst, I think it is too early to say yet, because a lot is going to depend on whether over the next months it becomes clear that we are heading towards either a vaccine... and that the future trajectory is one of returning the economy to something like normal, or whether, by contrast, we are not heading towards an early development of a vaccine or a treatment, and we have to plan in terms of restarting the economy living with Covid.""Lord Darling: ""The government will need to introduce measures, firstly to deal with a wave of unemployment which I think will come once the furlough system starts being phased out, and also to make sure that people who are displaced from the workplace, who lose their jobs, that we can get them back into work as quickly as possible.""It will be necessary for the government to make sure that you don't end up with a recession becoming a depression.""Mr Osborne: ""The central challenge... is how do you withdraw some of the very necessary schemes to have kept people in work and businesses afloat during the crisis. The furlough scheme has been absolutely essential... many people on furlough are going to go back to their jobs. ""But we have to be honest and say that quite a lot of those businesses will not come back... and trapping people on a scheme that is generous to them in the short term, but actually prevents them from re-entering the labour force to get the new job they need, is potentially very damaging. ""So I think the withdrawal of the furlough is going to be important for employment in the short term, and at the same time some of these loans to businesses that are never coming back are going to become an issue.""Mr Osborne: ""There's a whole separate issue about what you do with these large stakes we're going to take in large companies like airlines, potentially, and aerospace manufacturers. ""All of us have experience on this panel of pretending that you're managing these bank holdings that we had in the last decade at arm's length, and still when Treasury questions came up we were being asked about the bonuses being paid to chief executives, why branches were being closed in the constituencies of members.""I can imagine an airline saying it wants to shut an uneconomic route to one of the further-flung parts of the UK... I think that's going to be more problematic than I think people have realised at the moment.""Lord Darling: ""We need to get ourselves into the frame of mind where we're thinking about 1980's levels of unemployment.""If it doesn't happen, that's great, but I think we need to be ready for that, and if we're not ready for that, people will ask: 'Why didn't you start thinking abut these things?'""""If you take the aviation industry, you'll notice that France and Germany are not indifferent to whether or not their national airline is surviving. Our model here is slightly different, in that the idea of a flag-carrier isn't quite what it was, but I think most people would take the view that we've got to ensure that we've got a transport industry.""Lord Darling: ""If you want stimulate the economy, the most obvious thing to do is a time limited VAT reduction.""When we get to the happy day when we're recovering... yes, we are going have very high debts, like we had at the end of the Second World War, but one of the things that a government like ours can do... you can actually carry that for some period. I would be very concerned if in the recovery phase you start clamping down on things prematurely, and you drive the country back into a recession.""Mr Hammond: ""I don't think there's any economic logic to increasing taxes in the short term. I think we all accept that the UK as a credit-worthy, mature, larger economy can carry more debt in the context of the short term crisis. ""Of course, we have to remember that debt is cumulative by its nature. We increased debt very substantially during the course of dealing with the last crisis, and we'd only just got back to the point where we were starting to see debt very slightly decline as a share of GDP. Now we're going to see it increase significantly again as a share of GDP, so eventually we have to think about how we manage the challenge of debt in the long term.""",4 June 2020,business
'I’m ready to face quarantine just to get away',"HR professional Angela Russell and her partner Steve have decided that despite coronavirus, they will be flying to Montenegro on 5 July.They're only going for a week's holiday, but the prospect of having to spend two weeks in quarantine on their return doesn't bother them.""I have become totally fed up with all the bad news and how the government is dealing with issues,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm prepared to put up with quarantine just to get away from here for a bit.""The couple will be holidaying with a friend of Angela's who has terminal cancer, accompanied by her husband. ""She had planned to do a lot of travelling this year and until now, all her plans have been kiboshed.""The four have booked to fly with Jet2, which plans to resume its flight programme on 1 July. A number of other airlines and tour operators have announced similar plans.Ryanair and Tui are also due to restart services from the beginning of July, while EasyJet is taking to the skies again from 15 June.British Airways has said it will launch ""a meaningful return to service"" in July, while Virgin Atlantic has said flights will not resume until August.However, at the moment, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is still advising against all non-essential foreign travel, with no indication of when the policy might change.A spokesperson for Jet2 said the firm always followed FCO guidelines and was ""reviewing the situation on a daily basis"".Jet2 declined to give any details of the level of bookings over the next few months, describing it as ""commercially sensitive information"". The BBC has approached other airlines and holiday firms for comment.One airline that does seem to be confident about the future is budget carrier Wizz Air, which said on Wednesday that it was still planning to take delivery of new aircraft.""Whatever we can fly, we're going to be flying, because we've seen that there is actually demand out there,"" said the airline's chief executive, Jozsef Varadi.Angela, who lives in Wales, is semi-retired and now works just one day a week, which she can easily do from home if forced to self-isolate. She points out that Montenegro is ""pretty much coronavirus-free"" .""I've spent my life assessing risk, either in work or in my daily life,"" she says. ""The only risk is that we might pick it up at the airport.""She adds: ""My fear is that Montenegro will say, 'We don't want to let people in from the UK, because you don't seem to manage it very well.'""But I feel it's imperative now that we support the travel industry. We have to take a pragmatic approach to how we do things.""Another hopeful holidaymaker is Robert Jenkins, of Bedwas in south Wales, who usually goes abroad four or five times a year with his wife Barbara. ""We're retired and travelling is very important to us,"" he told the BBC.Robert and Barbara are hedging their bets, with not one, but two trips booked between now and the end of the year.The couple are due to fly with EasyJet to Malaga in Spain on 1 July and to the Greek island of Kos on 12 September.But Robert says he is poised to cancel the Spanish trip, because ""the FCO still hasn't given the go-ahead and I don't know if I'll be insured"".He is also worried by the Spanish tourism minister's remarks this week that British coronavirus figures ""still have to improve"" before Spain can receive tourists from the UK.""I'm really hoping Greece will go ahead. We've gone to the same resort for 20 years and we are on first-name terms with the people in the village we stay at,"" he says.""But it's all up in the air. Things are changing day by day.""Anyone considering booking an overseas holiday needs to find their balance on a financial tightrope.As always, if you book on a flight which is subsequently cancelled, you should be refunded, although millions of people have already found that can be a slow, and still unresolved process.Booking a package holiday also offers financial protection if it is later cancelled owing to a second wave of the virus or current restrictions being extended.Insurance is more complex. Travelling against Foreign Office advice, which is still that anything but essential travel should be avoided, would invalidate existing insurance. That has implications for claiming the cost of accommodation, car hire and so on, but also medical care.We still do not know when that advice will be lifted. It is under review.Those buying a new insurance policy - irrespective of the travel advice - will often find that it will not cover you for coronavirus-related issues, such as having to cancel a break because you have been told to self-isolate.

Coronavirus: Sex workers fear for their future,"With social distancing rules in place and strip clubs and brothels closed, sex workers around the world have seen their incomes disappear almost overnight as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Fearing for their livelihoods, as well as their health, some are offering services online to keep their business going, while others are turning to charities for help.Estelle Lucas has worked as an escort for the past 10 years in Melbourne, carefully building relationships with her clients. But the spread of Covid-19 and the need for social distancing has prompted a ban on sex work, leaving her worried those efforts will go to waste.  ""It's fair to say that if I'm not working for six months, a lot of people are going to forget me,"" she says.""I can't contact my clients and just have a conversation with them. That doesn't work in my industry. We need to build intimacy and that's just not possible in the current environment."" Before the coronavirus outbreak, Estelle says she was earning an above-average income, and had hoped to soon pay off the mortgage on her home in Melbourne's inner suburbs. Now nearly all her income has been lost. She has tried to adapt by moving her business online, but says that cannot replace physical contact.""Unfortunately, there are things that can't be translated,"" she says. ""I have made efforts to go online but not everyone is tech savvy. Some of my clients don't even really know how to use a smartphone.""While the regional government has outlined a clear roadmap to reopening restaurants and cafes, there has been no plan for the sex industry. That uncertainty, coupled with the many unknowns surrounding the virus itself, has left many sex workers with deep anxiety. ""I'm scared that all my work will come back to zero and I will just have to start hustling like I did when I first started out,"" Estelle says. She also fears for her clients' health. ""Are they even going to be there?"" she says. ""There's a lot of nervous energy going around.""Financial assistance from the Australian government is available to those who have lost their income because of the Covid-19 crisis, but to qualify for the payments workers need to be able to show they have been paying tax - something that unregistered sex workers including migrants and trans people, often won't be able to do. It's a problem facing sex workers in dozens of countries around the world, according to Teela Sanders, a criminology professor at the University of Leicester. ""Governments have been very good at providing social protection for the majority of people, particularly self-employed people, but sex workers are not included,"" she says.That's left sex worker collectives and advocacy groups calling for members of the public to donate to emergency funds. So far, an online appeal by the Las Vegas Sex Worker Collective has raised $19,300 (£15,680) while a campaign by a coalition of support groups in Italy has raised almost €21,700 (£19,500).""These have been a real lifeline to sex workers for immediate bill paying, access to food etc,"" says Prof Sanders. Some sex workers have been forced to continue working, risking hefty fines or exposure to the virus. ""In developing countries, sex workers are often the main breadwinner for the whole family, for their siblings, their children and their grandparents. So this affects the whole extended family,"" Prof Sanders says.Niki Adams from the English Collective of Prostitutes echoes that view. She told the BBC most sex workers in the UK are mothers and if they are continuing to work, it is because they are desperate for money. But some sex workers find themselves unable to keep working - even if they would choose to. In Daulatdia brothel in Bangladesh, police guard the entrance, preventing customers from entering. It is one of the world's biggest brothels, a shanty town made up of tin sheds and narrow alleyways that is home to 1,300 women and their 400 children.The brothel has been closed since March, leaving many of the women struggling to buy essential items and relying on donations from charities.  ""We cannot work now, so we don't have any income, which is scary,"" says ""Nazma"", who didn't want to give her real name. Nazma supports three children who live with her sister back in her village. She came to the brothel 30 years ago when she was just seven. Although she needs money, she worries about the dangers of working during the pandemic.""Even if we could work, people's lives are at risk from the virus. We'd be scared to go to bed with our clients anyway, as we don't know who is affected,"" she says.Daulatdia sits on the banks of the Padma River, near a major ferry terminal. It is the main transport hub that connects the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka with the country's southern districts. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, thousands of truck drivers would pass through the area every day, delivering agricultural products and other goods to Dhaka. Many of the women and children who live in the brothel are victims of trafficking. ""A lot of them who were kidnapped as children were sold there,"" says Srabanti Huda, a lawyer and human rights activist based in Dhaka.While the Bangladeshi government and local aid organisations have delivered some emergency funds to the women, Srabanti says it hasn't been enough and some women received nothing at all. ""The amount of donations they've received from the government does not even cover a packet of powdered milk for the children,"" she says. In early May, Srabanti organised a private aid delivery, distributing packets of basic supplies for each of the 1,300 women registered at the brothel. ""There was one woman who said she has not been able to get her insulin or diabetic medications for over a month,"" Srabanti says. ""Another said she has not been able to buy her blood pressure medications since the lockdown started two months ago.""Reduced access to healthcare services is an issue facing sex workers globally, according to Prof Sanders. The problem is particularly acute in areas where there is high demand for regular antiviral drugs from those living with HIV.""There's been real issues around access,"" she says. Prof Sanders is working with a team in Nairobi to develop an ""Uber-style"" app that will enable sex workers to order medication using their phones and have it delivered. ""It's sent directly to them via a mode of transport rather than the person coming into the clinic,"" she says. Back in Daulatdia brothel, another sex worker who didn't want to be named is returning from a trip to see her daughter, who lives in a nearby home for the children of sex workers. Even when the brothel reopens, it will take a long time for the industry to recover, she says.""People are afraid if they come to us, they might get infected,"" she says. ""We are afraid too. We might get infected from them. This fear of getting infected will come up all the time.""Additional reporting by Salman Saeed.",3 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: What's it like to be laid off over Zoom?,"When travel start-up Pana held a meeting for all of its employees over Zoom, they explained that some staff would be laid off, and that there would be two further calls that morning - one at 09:00 for those who would be laid off, and one at 09:45 for those who would not.Employees would know which meeting they were attending by the invites they would have received by email.Sales executive Ruthie Townsend was invited to join the 09:00 call but, due to the shock of the news, she could not remember which call was for those about to be laid off, and which was for those being retained.""Because it was such a highly stressful situation, it was hard to process what was going on so I got mixed up. I joined the 09:00 call as that was the invite I had, and once I realised that I was being laid off, I quickly turned off my video,"" she says. Ms Townsend was on the call with 15 of her colleagues, and executives from the company then walked these employees through the benefits, the severance package and the next steps.The company, based in Denver, Colorado, had been hit by the collapse in travel due to the coronavirus outbreak.But there had been a feeling that redundancies would be a last resort, and Ms Townsend had no idea what was coming that morning. That kind of shock is unfortunately commonplace at the moment, as companies are slashing staff numbers to cope with the economic fallout from the coronavirus.Before the crisis managers would usually have met staff face-to-face, to give them the bad news.Now video-conferencing tools, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams (MS Teams), are being used to replicate the formality of the meeting.Chris Malone, an audio visual technician at events company Sparq in the UK, feared for his role when it was explained to him that a HR representative would be on his next MS Teams call along with his line manager. His instincts proved correct, as he was told he was going to be laid off.For him, the use of a video call made the meeting formal, but more awkward than an in-person meeting or telephone call. ""I think if you were doing it over the phone, it would mean you don't have to look at someone but when you have the video call, you get dressed up to make it feel formal and to look presentable. ""Even though it is a video call, the pressure is there - and as you're not in the room with them there isn't a natural chemistry, connection or body language you can read off, and there's a little bit of a delay, you're waiting for someone else to say something,"" he says.However, Mr Malone believes that a one-to-one video call is still the best way a business can break the unfortunate news to an employee in the current circumstances. For Ms Townsend, there were pros and cons to having more than 15 people on the same call as her.""I don't think any way of making someone redundant over video conference is going to be ideal. If it's one-on-one, it's still going to be really hard and then your boss is going to see all of your emotions. I liked the group setting because I turned off my video, and I didn't have to say anything,"" she says. However, she believes that the group setting prevented her from asking important questions at the time. More Technology of BusinessSarah Evans, partner at law firm JMW, explains that communication prior to any announcement is key for employers. ""What many big businesses can do is conduct large meetings on Zoom, to make an announcement to the same people at the same time, so there's no miscommunication going around,"" she says.This would make it clear that redundancies or the furlough scheme are being considered for employees, and would also make clear what this means for the business, and how they intend to follow-up with individuals.It is key for employers to provide employees with time to absorb the information, ask questions and give people the opportunity to voluntarily be made redundant or furloughed. ""In redundancy cases, that would be at least a couple of meetings to go through opportunities to avoid redundancy and consider alternatives, and there's no reason why all of this can't be done on Zoom,"" she says.The use of video, phone call or in-person, is not a legal matter; it's merely a matter of etiquette. However, the group call, which Ruthie Townsend had experienced in the US, would not be allowed in the UK.""That wouldn't cut it in UK law, as you have a right to individual consultation. There's nothing wrong with a group call to announce potential redundancies but you shouldn't be making people redundant in the same video call,"" Ms Evans says. If this were the way a UK employer had acted, the employee might then have a case for unfair dismissal. The option to record video calls could also prove problematic in these cases. Peter Binning, a partner at law firm Corker Binning, explains that, generally speaking, anyone should ask for consent before recording a call of any kind. However, regardless of whether consent was asked for, given or not given, a recorded conversation could still be admissible in an unfair dismissal case. ""Whoever wants to use the evidence has to be able to prove that it had been properly recorded and was genuine but it would be a matter for the court or tribunal to decide whether that evidence should be admitted,"" Mr Binning says.And those wanting to snoop on people by deliberately joining a Zoom call where someone else is being made redundant would most definitely be breaking the law - as there are a number of criminal offences about intercepting communications in the regulations.While video may create new problems, it is the best replacement for a meeting in person. ""It will feel more uncomfortable to look someone in the eye, and the level of emotional frustration and anger will be more visible, but it is essential to delivering the message in an open, fair and transparent way to another person,"" says Stuart Duff, an expert on the psychology of leadership at business psychology consultancy Pearn Kandola.",2 June 2020,business
Carly Fiorina's journey from secretary to CEO,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Carly Fiorina, US business leader, political figure and philanthropist.It should give hope to any young person striving to reach the top, knowing that Carly Fiorina started her business career as a humble secretary.""I spent my time greeting visitors, answering phones, typing memos,"" she says. ""But I was really committed to the job, arriving early, and leaving late.""Mrs Fiorina, 65, is looking back on her 21-year-old self, who in 1976 got her first full-time job at a small property company in Palo Alto, California.From that modest start she went on to become the first female chief executive of a Fortune 50 company (the 50 largest firms in the US). This happened in 1999 when, aged 44, she was appointed to the top job at computer group Hewlett-Packard.Fortune magazine subsequently named her the most powerful woman in US business five years in a row, with the publication declaring that ""Carly Fiorina didn't just break the glass ceiling, she obliterated it"".However, her time at HP was not universally regarded as a success, with much criticism of her decision to merge the business with rival Compaq in 2001. And in 2005 she resigned after a disagreement with her fellow board members.Mrs Fiorina subsequently entered the political arena, first as an adviser to the late John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. McCain went on to lose the election to Barack Obama.Eight years later, she herself ran to become the Republican Party candidate for the 2016 presidential election. She dropped out after nine months, due to low polling numbers, with Donald Trump going on to win both the candidacy and, of course, the presidency. She said at the time that she was ""horrified"" by Trump.Born in 1954 in Austin, Texas, her family moved around a lot, due to her father's job. Her dad, Joseph Sneed, was a law professor who went on to become US deputy attorney general. Her mother was a painter.She got a degree in philosophy and medieval history from Stanford University in California, before gaining a Master of Business Administration from the University of Maryland.In 1980 she entered the technology sector when she joined US giant AT&T as a management trainee. Her rise at the company was meteoric. By 1990 she was the firm's first female vice president, and by 1995 she was a senior director at AT&T spinoff Lucent Technologies. It was also while at AT&T that she met her husband Frank, and they were married in 1985.Mrs Fiorina's success at the telecoms giant caught the attention of HP, who were looking for a fresh start after missing nine quarterly profit targets in a row. She was appointed to the top job at the company in July 1999.""When I arrived at HP I purposely brought no-one new in at the beginning,"" she says. ""I did that for a very explicit reason, which was to send a very clear message to the organisation that we could, and we would, figure out what the problem was, and we would fix it.""[However], I was brought in by the board to transform the company. Those were the words they used.""Under Mrs Fiorina's leadership, costs were reduced, and eventually 30,000 jobs were removed from the combined 145,000 HP and Compaq workforce. A further 80,000 employees took pay cuts at a business which at its peak was worth $87bn (£71bn). ""Of course it is incredibly difficult to have to fire people, to have to lay people off,"" she says. ""In that very difficult circumstance, the best I could do was to fully explain why.""Why are we having to lay people off? Because if we don't, we will go out of business like many of our peers.""When the merger between HP and Compaq went ahead in 2002, it was the biggest ever in the technology sector at the time, and created the world's largest seller of personal computers.Whether the merger was a success, however, is still hotly contested. Tech website ZDNet said in 2016 that HP and Compaq's coming together was ""the worst merger ever"". By contrast, the Huffington Post called it ""the merger that worked"".What is certain is that the HP board were unhappy with the profits and share price of the combined business, and Mrs Fiorina was asked to resign in 2005. Her severance package was reportedly worth $21m.""We did, in fact, restore a great company,"" she says. ""[But] we had a dysfunctional board. It was dysfunctional when I arrived. It was dysfunctional when I left.""If leading HP wasn't enough of a battle, Mrs Fiorina jumped into politics for a decade from 2006. After working for John McCain, she went on to stand as the Republican candidate in the 2010 US Senate election in California, but lost out to the Democratic Party incumbent.Mrs Fiorina then worked for the American Conservative Union, a right-wing lobbying organisation, before running to be the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. Looking back on this campaign, she says that ""the process itself is insane"".She adds: ""Meaning, when you think about the process the  candidates go through, does it really help someone to be a better leader? Does it help us to decide a better leader? I don't think so.""It is a really crazy process that goes on for far too long. It is far too driven by a media spectacle.""But with another US presidential election due to be held this autumn, what does she think of President Trump after his four years in office? She declines to comment.More The Boss features:While the worlds of politics and business can be tough, Mrs Fiorina's biggest fight came in 2009 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and subsequently required a double mastectomy.She says the experience taught her a great deal. ""While I hope to never go through cancer again, it was a very important part of my journey, and for that I'm grateful.""I learned and grew so much during this time - learned about love and friendship, grew in my faith, and valued the kindness of strangers.""Technology firm boss Mihai Ivascu says that Mrs Fiorina is an ""inspirational leader"". ""She does not limit herself to what she is expected to do,"" says Mr Ivascu, who runs London-based M3 Holdings, and was included on a ""Forbes 30 Under 30"" list of leading young entrepreneurs. ""And as she has said, leadership is about changing the status quo when it needs changing.""In recent years Mrs Fiorina, who lives with her husband in Washington DC, has dedicated most of her time to her charity work. This includes being the chair of Good360, which helps companies give their surplus merchandise to various charities, and running Unlocking Potential, which helps the bosses of charities improve their leadership skills.Looking back on the start of her career, and her days as a secretary, she says: ""I was going to be the best secretary out there. I had no idea where it would lead.""",1 June 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  We have lost 500 Billion Dollars a year, for many years, on Crazy Trade with China. NO MORE!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpOne of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

George Floyd: SoftBank launches $100m minorities startup fund,"Japan's SoftBank is the latest major company to respond to the protests over the death of George Floyd.The technology giant has launched a $100m (£80m) fund that will invest in companies led by ""people of colour"". It comes as executives of firms including Twitter, Bank of America and General Motors have spoken out over racial inequality.George Floyd's death has sparked huge protests against racism and police brutality across the US and globally.Announcing the ""Opportunity Growth Fund"" on Twitter, SoftBank's founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son wrote “Racism is a lamentable thing,” ending his post with ""#BlackLivesMatter"".In a letter to employees the company's chief operating officer Marcelo Claure said the fund, which he will lead, aims to invest in entrepreneurs “from communities that face systemic disadvantages in building and scaling their businesses.”SoftBank also runs the $100bn Vision Fund which invests in startups around the world.Meanwhile, Twitter's Jack Dorsey has become the latest chief executive of a major US technology company to give financial support to an anti-racism organisation.He tweeted that he was making a $3m donation to former NFL player Colin Kaepernick’s Know Your Rights Camp to ""advance the liberation and well-being"" of minority communities.More #startsmall grants.$3mm to Colin @Kaepernick7’s @yourrightscamp to advance the liberation and well-being of Black and Brown communities through education, self-empowerment, mass-mobilization to elevate the next generation of change leaders. https://t.co/WGgKziHnwBEnd of Twitter post  by @jackMr Kaepernick is best known for kneeling during the US national anthem when he was a player for the San Francisco 49ers to protest against police killings of African-Americans.His protests were heavily criticised by conservative figures including President Donald Trump.In recent days some of the biggest corporations in the US have pledged to take action in support of racial equality.On Tuesday Bank of America said it would donate $1bn over the next four years to community programmes and small businesses to help address economic and racial inequality.In a media release chief executive Brian Moynihan said that ""underlying economic and social disparities"" had been made worse by the coronavirus pandemic and the ""events of the past week have created a sense of true urgency"".Car making giants General Motors and Ford has also condemned racial inequalityIn a letter to employees, dealers and suppliers, General Motors' chief executive Mary Barra wrote that she was “impatient and disgusted” and emphasised the need to “individually and collectively” drive change.Ford’s executive chairman, Bill Ford, and chief executive Jim Hackett also wrote a joint letter to their workers addressing the “tragic killing of George Floyd” and America’s “systemic racism.”Many other US companies, including Intel, Netflix, Nike and Facebook, have also spoken out about discrimination against African-Americans.",4 June 2020,business
Thousand of cinemas in China under threat of closure,"More than 40% of cinemas in China could go bust, according to a bleak report by the China Film Association.Having been temporary closed during the virus pandemic, audiences may struggle to return, the association says.Millions of Chinese have enjoyed watching movies online during cinema closures thanks to a wide range of streaming services.As a result, thousands could shut permanently in a ""massive bloodbath"" predicts one Chinese business expert.There are now more than 12,000 cinemas in China, according to market research firm IBISWorld. This figure has more than doubled in the past decade as China has embraced movie-going. But four out of 10 said they ""are very likely to close"" in the near future, according to the China Film Association survey. This could mean nearly 5,000 cinemas going bust as a result of the pandemic. Cinemas have been among the last venues to reopen in China as lockdown measures are gradually lifted. The Chinese government said that cinemas, along with other indoor entertainment venues, could reopen with limited bookings. In the first quarter of 2020, China's box office takings have fallen significantly, according to the film association. Small cinemas with fewer than 500 seats suffered the most, with revenues only reaching 10% of those taken during the same period last year.If cinema re-openings are delayed until October, annual revenues would plunge by 91% across the board, the association predicts.  Last year, China generated 64.2bn yuan (£7.2bn) from movie ticket sales as millions flocked to cinemas.Shaun Rein, founder of the China Market Research Group, believes a major challenge will be the growing strength of China's online movie sector, which is hugely competitive with platforms such as Iqiyi, Youkou and Tencent Video. He said subscriptions were cheap at around $2 a month for a basic package, while movie tickets often sell for $20.""Chinese players are just so cheap, often because they are subsidised as they are owned by giant internet players like Alibaba, Baidu or Tencent,"" he said.""Aside from fears over catching Covid-19, consumers won't go back to cinemas anytime soon as the digital offerings are too good and cheap,""He also predicted more pain for cinemas if film companies start to launch direct-to-digital offerings and charge higher prices for online movie releases on a pay-as-you-go basic on top of subscription rates. ""I expect the cinema sector to face a massive bloodbath and many will go out of business,"" he added.Another challenge is getting people back into cinemas due to the lack of new films, with production curtailed due to travel and social restrictions. ""We hear about 20% of local productions have begun or resumed physical work, with the balance postponed or in financial difficulty related to the Covid-19 outbreak,"" said Rance Pow, chief executive of Artisan Gateway, an Asian film industry consultant.""So that complicates the timing and recovery of cinemas as well; 'must see' films will be needed like never before to bolster the industry recovery"". Some have warned that China's film industry will lose up to 30bn yuan this year, including the National Film Administration, a government body.Others are less pessimistic about the fortunes of China's cinemas. ""The predictions are dire, but I'm more optimistic,"" said Chris Fenton, a former motion picture president and author of Feeding the Dragon. He points to the Chinese government's desire to have a world-class film industry and largest market in the world.""Plus the Chinese have embraced movie-going into the cultural fabric of society. It's a habit they are rabid about. That urge to visit cinemas regularly has not waned"".",4 June 2020,business
HSBC and StanChart back China security laws for HK,"HSBC and Standard Chartered have given their backing to China's new security laws for Hong Kong.Both banks made statements saying the proposed law can help maintain long-term stability in the troubled city.On Wednesday, HSBC's Asia Pacific chief executive Peter Wong signed a petition backing the law which has been widely criticised.But this backing comes as Japanese bank Nomura said it was ""seriously"" examining its presence in Hong Kong.It is unusual for a bank to enter into political debate, particularly one as controversial as China's new security laws which many feel could mark the end of Hong Kong's unique freedoms.HSBC's statement noted that the Hong Kong Association of Banks had already issued a statement saying the law would contribute to a stable business environment. Although it is Europe's largest bank, HSBC has a strong presence in Asia, particularly Hong Kong. HSBC ""respects and supports all laws that stabilise Hong Kong's social order,"" it said in a post on social media in China.The bank's full name is the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and it has its origins in the former British colony. While HSBC moved its headquarters to London in 1993, Hong Kong is still its biggest market. Standard Chartered also has a strong presence in Asia. ""We believe the national security law can help maintain the long-term economic and social stability of Hong Kong,"" it said in a statement. It added that ""the 'one country, two systems' principle is core to the future success of Hong Kong and has always been the bedrock of the business community's confidence"". Meanwhile, Japanese investment bank Nomura said it was reviewing the scale of its operations in Hong Kong. The bank's chief executive, Kentaro Okuda, said that while Hong Kong remained its most critical Asian hub outside Japan, the situation now was ""not the same as it used to be"" in an interview with the FT.While the details are still being fleshed out, the new security laws would make criminal any act of:Hong Kong residents are concerned this will affect free speech and their right to protest. In China this would be seen as subversion. People are also worried about suggestions that China could set up its own institutions in Hong Kong responsible for security.""The new national security law will deal the most severe blow to the rights of people in Hong Kong since the territory's transfer to China in 1997,"" according to Human Rights Watch.HSBC had been previously caught up in Hong Kong's anti-government protests, with its branches vandalised and bronze lion statues outside its headquarters defaced during a protest march in January.The bank is also facing its own challenges from the coronavirus pandemic with the prospect of thousands of job losses and a significant drop in earnings.HSBC didn't respond to a request from the BBC for further comments about the social media post.",4 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Ex-chancellors warn of severe unemployment ahead,"As the UK begins to ease lockdown restrictions, three former UK chancellors have been quizzed by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee about the effects of coronavirus on the UK economy.Alistair Darling, George Osborne and Philip Hammond were asked about the severity of the crisis versus the 2008-2009 financial crash; what measures could revive the economy; and whether taxes should increase to help pay the UK's mounting debts. They also suggested that unemployment could reach levels not seen since the 1980s.Alistair Darling: ""They are very different and this one [coronavirus], in my view, is much more serious.""The key difference between then and now is that from day one, the government wanted to get the economy going again, and therefore we introduced a range of measures, which enabled us to do that.""The situation today is different, in that firstly, it is part of government policy right across the world, and rightly so, to actually suppress economic activity through the lockdown and other measures... Unless and until the government gets control of the virus itself and the spread of the virus, it's difficult to see how you can pull out the stops and get the economy going again.""George Osborne: ""I am more optimistic, I think, than Alistair. If you look at the history of pandemics and plagues and the like in our society, then the economic bounceback is going to be relatively rapid.""If you look at the history of banking crises throughout our history, not just the one 10 years ago, but in the 1920s and 30s and in the 19th Century and before, recoveries are very slow and protracted and painful, because the credit channels of the economy are impaired, and despite all the work that Alistair did, and I did, to try and unclog those channels, it takes a long time for the allocation of capital to get to the efficiency it has before the banking crash.""Philip Hammond: ""In terms of which is the worst, I think it is too early to say yet, because a lot is going to depend on whether over the next months it becomes clear that we are heading towards either a vaccine... and that the future trajectory is one of returning the economy to something like normal, or whether, by contrast, we are not heading towards an early development of a vaccine or a treatment, and we have to plan in terms of restarting the economy living with Covid.""Lord Darling: ""The government will need to introduce measures, firstly to deal with a wave of unemployment which I think will come once the furlough system starts being phased out, and also to make sure that people who are displaced from the workplace, who lose their jobs, that we can get them back into work as quickly as possible.""It will be necessary for the government to make sure that you don't end up with a recession becoming a depression.""Mr Osborne: ""The central challenge... is how do you withdraw some of the very necessary schemes to have kept people in work and businesses afloat during the crisis. The furlough scheme has been absolutely essential... many people on furlough are going to go back to their jobs. ""But we have to be honest and say that quite a lot of those businesses will not come back... and trapping people on a scheme that is generous to them in the short term, but actually prevents them from re-entering the labour force to get the new job they need, is potentially very damaging. ""So I think the withdrawal of the furlough is going to be important for employment in the short term, and at the same time some of these loans to businesses that are never coming back are going to become an issue.""Mr Osborne: ""There's a whole separate issue about what you do with these large stakes we're going to take in large companies like airlines, potentially, and aerospace manufacturers. ""All of us have experience on this panel of pretending that you're managing these bank holdings that we had in the last decade at arm's length, and still when Treasury questions came up we were being asked about the bonuses being paid to chief executives, why branches were being closed in the constituencies of members.""I can imagine an airline saying it wants to shut an uneconomic route to one of the further-flung parts of the UK... I think that's going to be more problematic than I think people have realised at the moment.""Lord Darling: ""We need to get ourselves into the frame of mind where we're thinking about 1980's levels of unemployment.""If it doesn't happen, that's great, but I think we need to be ready for that, and if we're not ready for that, people will ask: 'Why didn't you start thinking abut these things?'""""If you take the aviation industry, you'll notice that France and Germany are not indifferent to whether or not their national airline is surviving. Our model here is slightly different, in that the idea of a flag-carrier isn't quite what it was, but I think most people would take the view that we've got to ensure that we've got a transport industry.""Lord Darling: ""If you want stimulate the economy, the most obvious thing to do is a time limited VAT reduction.""When we get to the happy day when we're recovering... yes, we are going have very high debts, like we had at the end of the Second World War, but one of the things that a government like ours can do... you can actually carry that for some period. I would be very concerned if in the recovery phase you start clamping down on things prematurely, and you drive the country back into a recession.""Mr Hammond: ""I don't think there's any economic logic to increasing taxes in the short term. I think we all accept that the UK as a credit-worthy, mature, larger economy can carry more debt in the context of the short term crisis. ""Of course, we have to remember that debt is cumulative by its nature. We increased debt very substantially during the course of dealing with the last crisis, and we'd only just got back to the point where we were starting to see debt very slightly decline as a share of GDP. Now we're going to see it increase significantly again as a share of GDP, so eventually we have to think about how we manage the challenge of debt in the long term.""",4 June 2020,business

The UK has consistently said it will not ask for a longer transition period.The Bank of England said Mr Bailey ""meets the leadership of UK banks on a very regular basis"".""As we have said previously, the possibility that negotiations between the UK and EU over a future trading relationship might not conclude in a deal is one of a number of outcomes that UK banks need to prepare for over the coming months,"" the Bank said in a statement.""It is fundamental to the Bank of England's remit that it prepares the UK financial system for all risks that it might face,"" it added.The UK and EU sides still have key sticking points in negotiations that are taking place, the BBC's Katya Adler told the Radio 4 Today programme this week.She said that negotiations have faltered and been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, so time is tight, and that if there are clashes between the two sides, because the talks are taking place online there is less opportunity to walk around the block to try and reach a consensus.Sticking points include common standards on the environment and labour markets and how disputes over those standards will be resolved, and access to fishing grounds.Some of the fundamentals of a no-deal Brexit have remained the same.On Wednesday Japanese car giant Nissan said that the UK's largest car manufacturing plant is still under threat if the UK leaves the European Union without a trade deal.Similarly, the Bank of England has warned about the negative economic effects of a no-deal Brexit for a number of years.The Bank has done stress tests looking at the effect of a ""disorderly"" Brexit on the banking system, and in 2018 said that major UK banks have enough capitalisation to withstand the shock of a no-deal Brexit.In short, the UK banking system would be strong enough to deal with it.In March, as the effects of the coronavirus crisis began to bite, the Bank said that due to ""extensive preparations"" by authorities and the private sector, if there was a no-deal Brexit, most risks to cross-border financial trade had been mitigated.",3 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Australia set for first recession in three decades,"Australia is set for its first recession in 29 years as the country feels the impact of the virus pandemic.Official figures show that the economy shrank by 0.3% in the first three months of the year, amid bushfires and the early stages of the outbreak.Economists expect data for the current quarter to confirm that the shutdowns have pushed the country into recession.It comes even after the government and central bank stepped up measures to support the economy.The latest gross domestic product (GDP) figures highlight that the economy was struggling from a devastating bushfire season, a slowdown in tourism and weak domestic demand even before the virus-related restrictions started. ""This was the slowest through-the-year growth since September 2009, when Australia was in the midst of the global financial crisis, and captures just the beginning of the expected economic effects of Covid-19,"" Bureau of Statistics chief economist Bruce Hockman said.In March the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its main interest rate to a record low of 0.25%. The central bank also launched an unlimited bond buying programme.While the central bank kept the cost of borrowing on hold at its meeting on Tuesday, Governor Philip Lowe said the country was facing the toughest conditions since the Great Depression.""The Australian economy is going through a very difficult period and is experiencing the biggest economic contraction since the 1930s.""However, he did add a note of optimism to his outlook: ""It is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected.""""The rate of new infections has declined significantly and some restrictions have been eased earlier than was previously thought likely,"" he said.The Australian government has also pledged hundreds of billions dollars to help support businesses and individuals and has signalled that more stimulus measures would be announced soon.Last month Japan fell into recession for the first time since 2015 as the world's third biggest economy shrank at an annual pace of 3.4% in the first three months of the year.The week before Germany, Europe's largest economy, slipped into recession, while other big economies, including the UK and the US are also seeing sharp downturns.A recession is widely defined as two  quarters in a row of economic contraction, or shrinking GDP.",3 June 2020,business
Google in $5bn lawsuit for tracking in 'private' mode,"Google has been sued in the US over claims it illegally invades the privacy of users by tracking people even when they are browsing in ""private mode"".The class action wants at least $5bn (£4bn) from Google and owner Alphabet.Many internet users assume their search history isn't being tracked when they view in private mode, but Google says this isn't the case.The search engine denies this is illegal and says it is upfront about the data it collects in this mode.The proposed class action likely includes ""millions"" of Google users who since 1 June 2016 browsed the internet in private mode according to law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who filed the claim on Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, California.Incognito mode within Google's Chrome browser gives users the choice to search the internet without their activity being saved to the browser or device. But the websites visited can use tools such as Google Analytics to track usage.The complaint says that Google ""cannot continue to engage in the covert and unauthorized data collection from virtually every American with a computer or phone"".Vigorously denying the claims Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: ""As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity"".The search engine says the collection of search history, even in private viewing mode, helps site owners ""better evaluate the performance of their content, products, marketing and more.""While private browsing has been available from Google for some time, Boies Schiller Flexner said it recently decided to represent three plaintiffs based in the US. ""People everywhere are becoming more aware (and concerned) that their personal communications are being intercepted, collected, recorded, or exploited for gain by technology companies they have come to depend on,"" it said in the filing. One option is for visitors to install Google Analytics browser opt-out extension to disable measurement by Google Analytics, it says.",3 June 2020,business
