US Senate passes bill that could delist some Chinese firms,"The US Senate has passed a bill that could block some Chinese companies from selling shares on American stock exchanges.It would require overseas firms to follow US standards for audits and other financial regulations.The measure now has to be passed by the House of Representatives before being signed into law by President Trump.It comes as US-China tensions increase over the virus pandemic and after the Luckin Coffee accounting scandal.The planned legislation would also require publicly traded companies to reveal whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.The bill applies to all foreign companies, but is targeted at China, and follows intense criticism of Beijing by Mr Trump and other US politicians.Mr Trump and officials in his administration argue that China mishandled the coronavirus outbreak in its early stages.The outbreak has now grown to become a pandemic that has killed almost 330,000 people worldwide and crippled the global economy.US-listed Chinese companies have already come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.The company said its own investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of last year to the fourth quarter amounted to about 2.2bn yuan ($310m; £254m).

Nasdaq to tighten rules amid concerns over Chinese firms,"Nasdaq has proposed new rules to make it more difficult for some Chinese firms to list on its stock exchange.Its proposals would mean companies from certain nations would have to raise at least $25m (£14.4m) or a quarter of their post-listing valuation to list.Tougher accounting rules will also apply for listings, which are called Initial Public Offerings (IPOs).The announcement comes as tensions increase between the US and China in the wake of the Luckin Coffee scandal.The proposed regulations do not single out Chinese businesses but do include additional measures for companies that mainly operate in countries whose laws make it hard for American authorities to conduct investigations.“The risks to US investors are heightened when a company’s business is principally administered in a jurisdiction that has secrecy laws, blocking statutes, national security laws or other laws or regulations restricting access to information by regulators of US-listed companies in such jurisdiction,” Nasdaq said.It comes at a time when rising tensions between Beijing and Washington in recent months makes co-operation over financial market regulations far less likely.

Stanley Ho: Hong Kong's 'king of gambling' dies aged 98,"Stanley Ho, the Hong Kong tycoon credited with turning Macau into the world's gambling capital, has died at the age of 98.Ho, one of Asia's richest men, was known as the ""king of gambling"".He was the head of one of the world's most lucrative gaming businesses, SJM Holdings, valued at about $6bn (£4.9bn). But the flamboyant billionaire, who loved to dance, famously always advised friends and family to shun gambling.""My father has passed away peacefully just now at around 1pm at Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital,"" Ho's daughter Pansy told reporters.""As Stanley Ho's family member, we are really sad to inform you of this.""Ho dominated the casino business in the former Portuguese colony of Macau after winning a government monopoly licence in the 1960s. As his fortune grew, he expanded beyond Macau, building residential and office buildings in Hong Kong as well as operating casinos in other countries, including Portugal and North Korea.His personal fortune was estimated at $6.4bn when he retired in 2018 just months before his 97th birthday.SJM Holdings flourished as the opening up of China's economy created a flood of new wealth in a country with a love of gambling. SJM now controls 20 casinos on Macau.Ho had four wives and 17 known children. He was forced to restructure his business after a legal battle erupted within the family in 2012 over his fortune.Martin Yip, BBC News ChineseIt's impossible to overestimate the influence Stanley Ho had in Macau and Hong Kong. He had a say in choosing the leadership of both territories, and China's state media has mourned him today as ""a patriotic entrepreneur"". Ho's fortunes were tightly linked the growth of Macau from a small fishing town to a wealth gambling centre. As he developed his gambling business there, he even built the enclave's connection with the outside world. His high speed ferries or helicopters were the quickest way to travel between Macau and Hong Kong in the early days, until the arrival of the Las Vegas giants, and later the opening of the mega Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. Ho leaves behind many biographies, some of them filled with sensational stories of how he built his Macau casino empire by outbidding some old tycoons. Others recount how he became a property developer famous - though not as big - as Li Ka-shing, how he dated and married four wives, and how his family grew to hold such influence across the Pearl River Delta.  His life was not without controversies, but to many ordinary people, it was more about the inspiration of dreaming big, and getting rich.  The ""King of Gambling"" has now died, but many in the business world will still seek his wisdom from the poker table as they chase their own success.  ",26 May 2020,business
Aston Martin chief leaves after 94% share price collapse,"Struggling luxury UK carmaker Aston Martin has announced that chief executive Andy Palmer has stepped down.Tobias Moers is taking over from 1 August, with Keith Stanton filling the gap as interim chief operating officer.Mr Moers joins from Mercedes' high-performance subsidiary AMG, where he is currently chief executive.Aston Martin was struggling before the coronavirus crisis hit sales and its share price is down 94% since the company's flotation in 2018.""The board has determined that now is the time for new leadership to deliver our plans,"" Aston Martin said in a statement.Mr Palmer said it had been ""a privilege"" to serve Aston Martin for almost six years. He thanked management and staff for ""their hard work and support, particularly during the challenges presented by Covid-19"".In other management changes, the firm said three of its directors - Richard Solomons, Imelda Walsh and Tensie Whelan - had departed on Saturday. They had already indicated that they would not seek re-election in June.The news was well received by the markets, with Aston Martin's share price surging more than 40% in Tuesday morning trading.Neil Wilson of Markets.com described the share price rise as ""a pretty damning indictment"" of Mr Palmer's tenure.Aston Martin sales halved in the first three months of the year, as the start of the coronavirus crisis took hold. The company sold 578 vehicles in the first quarter, down from 1,057 in the same period last year.It caused loss before tax to soar to £118.9m, up from £17.3m the year before.In January this year, Aston Martin announced plans to raise emergency funding worth £500m, with a consortium led by billionaire Lawrence Stroll putting in £182mMr Stroll, who is now executive chairman of the firm, partly owns the Racing Point Formula 1 team, which will be branded Aston Martin from 2021 under the deal.Mr Stroll said Mr Moers was ""the right leader for Aston Martin Lagonda as we implement our strategy for the business to achieve its full potential"". He added: ""Our ambition for the company is significant, clear and only matched by our determination to succeed.""Mr Moers said: ""I am truly excited to be joining Aston Martin Lagonda at this point of its development. I have always had a passion for performance cars and relish the chance to work for this iconic brand.""Aston Martin's illustrious name has never been reflected in financial success. The 107-year-old company has gone bankrupt seven times, hence a long history of different owners and restructurings. But Andy Palmer looked at first to have found a winning formula.When he joined in 2014 after 23 years with Nissan, the luxury carmaker was again close to bankruptcy. Palmer returned Aston to profitability, revamped the products, opened a factory in South Wales, and oversaw the company's stock market launch. But sales slowed, partly because of Aston's own making and partly because of global economic conditions. Investments in electric and sports utility vehicles raised eyebrows among purists, and Palmer's stretching of the brand into projects including a speedboat and property in Florida was just plain odd. The company ran up huge debts.The collapse in the share price - £19 in 2018, 35p last week - underlined the urgency for change. The new team at Aston Martin have indicated a back-to-basics strategy - high performance cars and racing. Investors seem to like what they are hearing. The shares soared more than 40% on news of Palmer's departure - a blunt verdict on his tenure. ",26 May 2020,business

US Senate passes bill that could delist some Chinese firms,"The US Senate has passed a bill that could block some Chinese companies from selling shares on American stock exchanges.It would require overseas firms to follow US standards for audits and other financial regulations.The measure now has to be passed by the House of Representatives before being signed into law by President Trump.It comes as US-China tensions increase over the virus pandemic and after the Luckin Coffee accounting scandal.The planned legislation would also require publicly traded companies to reveal whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.The bill applies to all foreign companies, but is targeted at China, and follows intense criticism of Beijing by Mr Trump and other US politicians.Mr Trump and officials in his administration argue that China mishandled the coronavirus outbreak in its early stages.The outbreak has now grown to become a pandemic that has killed almost 330,000 people worldwide and crippled the global economy.US-listed Chinese companies have already come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after Luckin Coffee revealed that an internal investigation found hundreds of millions of dollars of its sales last year were “fabricated”.The company said its own investigation had found that fabricated sales from the second quarter of last year to the fourth quarter amounted to about 2.2bn yuan ($310m; £254m).

Nasdaq to tighten rules amid concerns over Chinese firms,"Nasdaq has proposed new rules to make it more difficult for some Chinese firms to list on its stock exchange.Its proposals would mean companies from certain nations would have to raise at least $25m (£14.4m) or a quarter of their post-listing valuation to list.Tougher accounting rules will also apply for listings, which are called Initial Public Offerings (IPOs).The announcement comes as tensions increase between the US and China in the wake of the Luckin Coffee scandal.The proposed regulations do not single out Chinese businesses but do include additional measures for companies that mainly operate in countries whose laws make it hard for American authorities to conduct investigations.“The risks to US investors are heightened when a company’s business is principally administered in a jurisdiction that has secrecy laws, blocking statutes, national security laws or other laws or regulations restricting access to information by regulators of US-listed companies in such jurisdiction,” Nasdaq said.It comes at a time when rising tensions between Beijing and Washington in recent months makes co-operation over financial market regulations far less likely.

Coronavirus: Lufthansa agrees €9bn rescue deal with Germany,"Lufthansa has agreed a rescue deal worth €9bn (£8bn) with the German government that saves it from collapse.The German airline has been severely affected by a decline in travel due to the coronavirus and closed its budget airline Germanwings in April.The German government will take a 20% stake in the firm, which it intends to sell by the end of 2023.But the deal still has to be approved by the firm's shareholders and the European Commission.As part of the rescue package, the German government will also inject €5.7bn in non-voting capital, which is known as a ""silent participation"".Part of these funds can be converted into an additional 5% equity stake, which would enable the government to veto any potential hostile takeover bids. European markets rose on the news, with Lufthansa shares closing 7.5% higher, while Germany's Dax jumped 2%. The Frankfurt-based index closed at its highest level since 6 March.The Cac 40 index in France meanwhile rose 1.5%, and the pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 climbed 1.1%. Global airlines group IATA has said it expects airline passenger revenues to drop by more than 40% this year and warned that more than 25 million jobs in aviation and related industries are at risk.""The support that we're preparing here is for a limited period,"" said Germany's Finance Minister Olaf Scholz at a press conference on Monday.""When the company is fit again, the state will sell its stake and hopefully ... with a small profit that puts us into a position to finance the many, many requirements which we have to meet now, not only at this company.""The bailout deal is the result of weeks of talks between Lufthansa and the German government about financial aid and will help save up to 10,000 jobs.The German government has set aside a fund of €100bn to help shore up companies struck down by the pandemic. The airline had previously been operationally healthy and profitable with good prospects, but had run into trouble because of the coronavirus lockdown measures implemented by governments across the world.Lufthansa decommissioned more than 40 aircraft in April and said it would look to offload aircraft in its other businesses, which include Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Eurowings.The airline had warned that it does not expect demand for air travel to return for ""years"".Lufthansa is not the only national carrier that has needed to be rescued. On Sunday, the French and Dutch governments pledged a lifeline of more than €11bn in loans and guarantees to support Air France-KLM.Lufthansa has the most passenger traffic in Europe, followed by Air France-KLM, according to aviation analysts, the Centre for Aviation.The UK government has indicated that it is preparing its own plan to rescue large British firms.Last week, the bailout plan, named ""Project Birch"", was mentioned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps in Parliament during a discussion about the survival of the aviation industry.",25 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Spain to stop quarantining arrivals from 1 July,"Foreign visitors to Spain will no longer have to undergo a two-week quarantine from 1 July, the government has announced.It said the measure had been finalised in a cabinet meeting on Monday.Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya had previously said the requirement would be lifted in July, without giving a date.The news comes as the UK government prepares to bring in its own 14-day quarantine policy from 8 June.Travel firms and other industry bodies say the UK should relax the measure for visitors arriving from countries where people are at a lower risk of contracting the coronavirus.Spain normally attracts 80 million tourists a year, with the sector providing more than 12% of the country's GDP.Opening up the holiday market again before the summer season is over is seen as crucial to the Spanish economy. But under the UK's new policy, any tourists returning home after taking holidays in Spain and most other foreign destinations would have to spend two weeks in self-isolation.Several airlines including EasyJet, Jet2 and Ryanair have announced that they plan to resume flights and holidays soon.Easyjet will be resuming flights from 22 airports across Europe from 15 June, as well as regional flights across the UK. But there will only be one international flight from the UK - from Gatwick to Nice in France. Jet2 is planning to resume full services from 1 July, and will fly to several Spanish and Italian destinations, before opening up to Greece and Croatia later in the year.And Ryanair will be restoring 40% of its flights from 1 July and will resume flights from most of the 80 airports it flies from across Europe. Business groups wrote to Boris Johnson on Sunday saying the quarantine would have ""serious consequences"" for the economy and calling for ""air bridge"" deals to be struck with other nations.In their letter to the prime minister, bosses of airlines EasyJet, Tui, Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic, as well as industry bodies Airlines UK, the British Chambers of Commerce, UK Hospitality and manufacturing association Made UK said they had ""serious reservations"" about a ""blanket approach"" to all arrivals into Britain.Instead, they are asking for a more ""targeted, risk-based"" approach when establishing air links with countries that have high infection rates from the pandemic. ""The alternative risks major damage to the arteries of UK trade with key industry supply chains, whilst pushing the UK to the back of the queue as states begin conversations for opening up their borders,"" says the letter.",25 May 2020,business
Volkswagen loses landmark German 'dieselgate' case,"Germany's highest civil court has ruled that Volkswagen must pay compensation to a motorist who had bought one of its diesel minivans fitted with emissions-cheating software. The ruling sets a benchmark for about 60,000 other cases in Germany. The plaintiff, Herbert Gilbert, will be partially reimbursed for his vehicle, with depreciation taken into accountVW said it would now offer affected motorists a one-off payment. The amount will depend on individual cases.The company has already settled a separate €830m (£743m) class action suit involving 235,000 German car owners.VW said in a statement on Monday: ""For the majority of the 60,000 pending cases, this ruling provides clarity as to how the [Federal Court of Justice] assesses essential questions in German diesel proceedings.""Volkswagen is now seeking to bring these proceedings to a prompt conclusion in agreement with the plaintiffs. We will therefore approach the plaintiffs with the adequate settlement proposals.""VW has paid out more than €30bn in fines, compensation and buyback schemes worldwide since the scandal first broke in 2015.The company disclosed at the time that it had used illegal software to manipulate the results of diesel emissions tests. It said that about 11 million cars were fitted with the ""defeat device"", which alerted diesel engines when they were being tested. The engine would then change its performance in order to improve the result of the test.  Volkswagen has faced a flurry of legal action worldwide, including the UK.About 90,000 motorists in England and Wales have brought action against VW as well as Audi, Seat and Skoda, which are also owned by Volkswagen Group.Last month, their case cleared its first hurdle in the High Court, when a judge ruled that the software installed in the cars was indeed a ""defeat device"" under EU rules.The carmaker's current and former senior employees are facing criminal charges in Germany.",25 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: How Chinese rivals are trying to take Zoom's crown,"Video meetings have become hugely important as the world adapts to the ""new normal"" of the pandemic.Even as lockdown rules ease, they're a safe, convenient and free way to stay in touch for business and socialising.Zoom has become the app of choice for millions, overshadowing rival products from much larger companies such as Microsoft and Google.But the firm is now facing major challenges from some of China's biggest technology companies.Beijing temporarily blocked the international version of Zoom in September, leaving the market wide open to local players, including Alibaba's DingTalk and Tencent-backed VooV.Since then two big Chinese video conferencing apps have significantly increased the size and reach of their services.Alibaba's DingTalk says it is used by more than 10 million businesses and organisations and in excess of 120 million students across China.As more people have been forced to work from home DingTalk has tripled the number of participants that can join a meeting to just over 300.In April, Alibaba launched the global version of the app, DingTalk Lite, across key Asian markets, including Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong. It is now available in Japanese, English, and Traditional Chinese.Two weeks earlier, Chinese gaming giant Tencent also made its video conferencing tool available overseas.VooV is the international version of Tencent Meeting, which was launched in December last year, and is currently available in several countries including India, Japan and Singapore. It can also host 300-strong meetings.""With the mounting number of new Covid-19 cases outside of China, we look forward to providing our users in other countries and regions with the capabilities to work remotely. As we move forward, we plan to roll out the service across the world, in compliance with local regulations,"" Lori Wu, vice-president of Tencent Cloud said as VooV was launched.Zoom came under further restrictions in China from the start of this month. ""In mainland China, new user registration is currently limited to enterprise customers who sign up through authorised sales representatives. Free users in mainland China may continue to join meetings hosted by registered customers,"" a company spokesperson told the BBC.According to Zoom's own numbers it now has 300 million daily active meeting participants, although it does not publish figures on daily users or registered users.There are huge amounts of money at stake, with the global market for teleconferencing technology predicted to reach $16bn (£9.2bn) by 2030, up from $6bn last year, according to business forecasting and analysis company Transparency Market Research.Software analyst Rishi Jaluria from DA Davidson highlighted how he sees different apps trying to get a slice of this market.""Zoom is primarily an application for businesses, not consumers. The Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns have led to rapid consumer adoption of Zoom, but remember, Zoom isn’t trying to monetise those consumers through advertising or data.""""On the other hand, the owners of DingTalk and VooV, Alibaba and Tencent, respectively, have multiple businesses that rely on advertising and user data,"" he added.",25 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Government draws up plan to rescue key firms,"The UK government has indicated it is prepared to rescue large British companies severely affected by the coronavirus crisis.The Treasury said ""last resort"" support could be made available if a firm's failure would ""disproportionately harm the UK economy"".The move follows indications that a number of big firms are seeking government help to survive the crisis.These include Jaguar Land Rover, which is in talks to secure a £1bn loan.The government has already put in place various initiatives to help companies weather the pandemic, including loan programmes, deferring of tax payments and the furlough scheme, which allows workers to receive 80% of their salary paid by the government.According to latest figures, eight million workers are covered by the furlough scheme which has been extended until the end of October. But from August, businesses will be expected to meet part of the cost of the scheme. Concern is growing that some big firms are still in difficulties even after making use of these options.The bailout plan, named ""Project Birch"", was mentioned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps in Parliament last week when discussing the future of the aviation industry.It could involve the state taking stakes in companies, although extending existing loans would be preferable.Unite the union welcomed the plan but urged the government to act quickly.""There is no more time to lose if we are to prevent a tsunami of job losses from sweeping through communities this summer,"" said Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner.""We still need to ensure that proposed changes to the job retention scheme do not undermine a plan to recover and rebuild and that workers continue to get their wages."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have put in place unprecedented levels of support to help businesses get through this crisis. ""Beyond that, many firms are getting support from established market mechanisms, such as existing shareholders, bank lending and commercial finance.""In exceptional circumstances, where a viable company has exhausted all options and its failure would disproportionately harm the economy, we may consider support on a 'last resort' basis. ""As the British public would expect, we are putting in place sensible contingency planning and any such support would be on terms that protect the taxpayer."" The BBC understands the Treasury would have to notify Parliament of any spend incurred, and although companies might seek financial assistance, this does not mean such support will be given.On Saturday, Sky News reported that Tata Steel, Britain's biggest steel producer, had approached both the Welsh and UK governments for financial aid that could run into hundreds of millions. Earlier this week, Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock told parliament that Tata Steel, which owns the steelworks in Port Talbot, needs around £500m in order to survive the pandemic. And according to the Financial Times, aviation industry bosses have been asking the government for a ""long-term investment facility"" that would help to support supply chains. Jim O'Neill, former Treasury minister and ex-chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told the newspaper he had been in discussion with government officials about creating a public sector-owned funding body to take stakes in firms that would be ""inherently stable"" in times of normal economic activity.

The man who sells 700 million sandwiches a year,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Patrick Coveney, chief executive of convenience food group Greencore.When you are the UK's largest maker of pre-packaged sandwiches the coronavirus lockdown is a significant problem.With everyone except key workers being asked to stay at home from 23 March, Greencore suddenly saw a vast drop in customer numbers.Supplying own-brand sandwiches to all the major supermarkets, and staff canteens - overnight there was hardly anybody in the UK's offices and other workplaces, to pop out in their lunch-break and buy a BLT or egg mayo.As a result, Greencore says its main ""food to go"" division, which usually sells 700 million sandwiches per year, plus salads and sushi, saw sales slump by 70% over the following month and a half.Patrick, who has led the Dublin-based and London-listed company since 2008 says it has been a ""period of unprecedented uncertainty"". And in an interview with Irish broadcaster RTE, he said it made previous worries about Brexit ""seem very trivial.In response to coronavirus, Greencore has shut three of its 16 UK facilities and furloughed 4,000 of its 11,500 employees. Patrick and his fellow board members have cut their own pay by 30%.He says he is proud of the staff that have remained in work, making sandwiches that include the ""thousands"" given for free to NHS workers across 20 UK hospitals.""Our people have been working around the clock to ensure that we can continue to provide high quality, fresh prepared food to both consumers and frontline workers during the pandemic.""Born in the Republic of Ireland in 1971, the 49-year-old is from a celebrated Irish family that is sometimes referred to as ""the Kennedys of County Cork"". Patrick's late father Hugh was a government minister in the 1990s. His brother Simon is the current tánaiste or deputy prime minister.After school Patrick gained a degree in commerce from the University College Cork. He then went to Oxford University, for a masters in management studies. He played rugby at both universities, and says the sport helped teach him ""the importance of building and working in great teams"".Oxford was followed by spending a decade at management consultants McKinsey, before he joined Greencore in 2005, as chief financial officer.Greencore had been set up in 1991 following the privatisation of the former state-owned Irish Sugar. It moved into convenience foods in 2001 before completely exiting the sugar business in 2006. In 2011 it switched its primary listing from the Irish Stock Exchange to London.While making sandwiches is the bulk of its business, it also produces a range of chilled prepared meals - everything from curries, to quiches and soups. The company says sales of these in first six weeks of the lockdown were higher than last year as people did more cooking at home. However, the rise was only as much as 5%.Although coronavirus is a challenge for Greencore, it is not the first major problem Patrick has had to deal with at the company. In 2008, only three months after he was promoted to chief executive, a £15m fraud was discovered at the company's Scottish water subsidiary Campsie.Patrick sacked three senior managers over the scandal. It was, he says, ""the most challenging moment"" of his professional life, and that it made him ""stronger and more determined as person and as a leader"".Retail analyst Nick Widdowson, founder of Shopper First, says that looking forward, a major issue facing Greencore and other makers of convenience food is how to reduce or remove the plastic packaging.""Providing ethically fresh, authentic, locally sourced product, together with sustainable packaging, will be key to any producer of convenience foods seeking to meet their consumers' changing expectations,"" he says.Patrick agrees. ""Two years ago I could make a balanced and consumer-friendly argument that packaging prolongs the life of food and produce items. [But] the world has moved on, plastic is seen as a problem, and so we need to find alternatives that are better for the environment.""More The Boss features:While Greencore's 2020 revenues and profits will inevitably be down on 2019's £1.5bn and £56.4m figures, the company says that sales of its pre-packaged sandwiches have now started to recover in recent weeks as more people have returned to work.It also said that a survey of 7,000 customers showed that many were now ""bored and frustrated"" with having to making their own lunches at home.""Greencore has an absolutely critical role to play in keeping the UK fed... and there is a powerful sense of commitment, skill, spirit, and purpose across the Greencore workforce in performing this role,"" says Patrick.",25 May 2020,business
Get ready for the 'holy grail' of computer graphics,"Ray tracing has always been the ""holy grail"" of computer graphics, says Jason Ronald, head of program management for the gaming console Xbox.The technique simulates a three-dimensional image by calculating each ray of light and promises stunning lighting effects with realistic reflections and shadows.The method finds where it bounces, collects information about what those objects are, then uses it to lay down a pixel and compose a scene.While the techniques have been around for a long time, ""we just haven't had processing power to deliver all of that in real time"", Mr Ronald says.In Hollywood, special effects have used ray tracing for a decade. For an important sequence, computers could churn overnight for a single frame.To do this for games in real time, you need to condense that to 1/60th of a second. Processing speed has now caught up to the task.Tech company Nvidia announced last year their latest graphics processing units (GPUs) will handle real-time ray tracing. Working with Nvidia, Microsoft developed a ray tracing update to Windows 10.Microsoft and Sony have announced their upcoming consoles, the Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5, will have ray tracing capabilities. Both of these systems are built on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) hardware.And now the tech is being incorporated into some of the world's most popular games.Minecraft, which first appeared in 2009, allows players to construct vast intricate structures. Developed by Swedish game studio Mojang, it currently is the best-selling video game in history.Minecraft's makers released an early ray-tracing version of their game on 16 April. A general release will follow near the end of the year.""It looks very different from the traditional rendering mode, and it looks better,"" says Jarred Walton, hardware editor at  PC Gamer.The big problem, he says, will be price barriers for now. ""The only way you can play it is with a PC that has a graphics card that costs at least $300 (£240),"" he says.Until now, developers used another technique called rasterisation.It first appeared in the mid-1990s, is extremely quick, and represents 3D shapes in triangles and polygons. The one nearest the viewer determines the pixel.Then, programmers have to employ tricks to simulate what lighting looks like. That includes lightmaps, which calculate the brightness of surfaces ahead of time, says Mr Ronald.But these hacks have limitations. They're static, so fall apart when you move around. For example you might zoom in on a mirror and find that your reflection has disappeared.More Technology of BusinessProgrammable shaders started appearing around 2001. They did a much better job at 3D lighting tasks but required much more computational power.""If we put all that into one game, the most amazing processor in the world would've gone just no, it's too much,"" says Ben Archard, senior rendering programmer at Malta-based 4A Games, developers behind a 2019 post-apocalyptic game called Metro Exodus.There were ways around that. If a programmer wanted to simulate the hazy light coming through fog, instead of working out all the points, they could just calculate a sample of them.  (These are called stochastic, statistical, or Monte Carlo approaches.)But with these workarounds, ""pretty quickly you lose that realism in a scene,"" observes Kasia Swica, Minecraft's senior program manager, based in Seattle.Ray tracing does better with realistic, real-time shadows, or reflections lurking in water or glass.""My favourite thing to do with ray tracing is to go underwater,"" says Miss Swica.""You get really realistic reflections and refractions, and neat shafts of light coming through as well,"" she says.With lockdowns around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic, the need for people to feel close while isolated ""is going to accelerate"" progress in technology, says Rev Lebaredian, vice president for simulation technology at Nvidia, in San Francisco.""With virtual and augmented reality, we're starting to feel like we're in the same place together,"" he says.So coronavirus will drive demand and progress, agrees Frank Azor, chief gaming solutions architect at AMD.One ""fiendish problem"" for ray tracing has involved how shaders can call on other shaders if two rays interact, says Andrew Goossen, a technical fellow at Microsoft who works on the Xbox Series X.GPUs work on problems like rays in parallel: making parallel processes talk to each other is complex.Working out technical problems for improving ray tracing will be the main tasks ""in the next five to seven years of computer graphics, at least,"" says Mr Ronald.In the meantime games companies will use other techniques to make games look slicker. Earlier this month Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite, released its latest game architecture, the Unreal Engine 5.It uses a combination of techniques, including a library of objects that can be imported into games as hundreds of millions of polygons, and a hierarchy of details treating large and small objects differently to save on its demands on processor resources.For most game makers such ""hacks and tricks"" will be good enough, says Mr Walton.",22 May 2020,business
African solutions to the coronavirus crisis,"The African continent hasn't been as badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic as other countries in the world so far, but new cases are on the rise and governments have introduced social distancing measures.And while the pandemic is bad for business, some African entrepreneurs have stepped up to be part of the solution and are seeing new opportunities. Frequent and thorough washing of hands with soap and warm water is one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. But according to Water Aid, four in 10 people around the world have no access to basic hand washing facilities. One of the ways in which the coronavirus is spread is via contaminated surfaces. Getting into the habit of regular hand washing can prevent infections, but the virus can still spread as people tend to touch the tap and other things around them.In a city like Freetown in Sierra Leone, a population of 2 million people has a water supply capacity which ideally should be used by no more than 800,000 people, according to international development consultancy firm IMC Worldwide. Water is already scarce, and now hand washing is crucial.To solve this problem, one business has developed a portable hands-free tap unit that is now being placed outside shops, banks and government buildings.The Fomel Industry and National Industrialization Centre (FINIC) usually specialises in manufacturing agriculture processing equipment and other machines.But now the firm, founded by Melvin Foday Kamara, is manufacturing a portable freestanding hands-free faucet that is operated by stepping on pedals to access soap and water on demand.Clean running water is also in short supply in Zimbabwe's capital Harare, where citizens told the BBC they are now washing their hands with washing up liquid, as they cannot afford to buy hand sanitiser.""In the area where I live, running water is very scarce, so we actually have to have buckets of water so that it's easy for us to wash our hands,"" Wadzanayi Musasa explains.""When we get home from the shops, we take off our gloves, we use dish washing liquid to wash our hands and someone will hold a jug of water [to rinse them].""Waste management and clean water provider Clean City is now distributing water around Harare's residential and commercial areas in tank trucks, so that citizens can collect extra buckets of water to ensure hygiene standards are preserved through the lockdown.The company started in 2018, in response to two cholera epidemics that hit Zimbabwe in 2008 and 2018. The firm says it realised that something had to be done to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Compared to people living in richer nations, people in developing countries are more negatively impacted by waste that isn't managed properly, which puts both human health and the environment at risk.More than 90% of waste in developing nations goes to dumpsites, according to data from the United Nations Environment Programme.Every day, Clean City also offers fumigation and decontamination services across Harare, which can be ordered using a mobile app.""We're basically driven by two principles - digital first and people first,"" says Clean City's chief executive Lovemore Nyatsine.""Everything is contactless. Our crews follow very clear processes to keep our clients and themselves safe.""One example of an industry stepping up as a result of the pandemic is the 3D printing community - tech firms, universities and 3D print enthusiasts with their own printers are responding to the shortage of healthcare workers' personal protective equipment (PPE) - and in some cases more complex hospital medical supplies - by making it themselves. Malawi has been experiencing severe shortages of PPE during the coronavirus lockdown.The shortages are due to costs of procuring the equipment, as well as disruption caused by the pandemic to global supply chains. Blantyre-based tech firm iMoSyS is one such company that is now using its 3D printers and computer assisted design (CAD) software to design reusable face masks and face shields for healthcare workers.Typically the firm focuses on providing IT and engineering services to enable the remote monitoring of industrial processes, infrastructure and patients' health.Entrepreneur Mayamiko Nkoloma, chief executive of iMoSyS, says his firm has received numerous requests from across the African continent, but also from overseas countries including the UK.""Anything is possible. We started with nothing but ideas, and we took our ideas to industries and pitched them to solve challenges,"" he tells the BBC.Despite the myriad challenges presented by the pandemic, to say nothing of the looming recession once lockdown measures are eventually lifted, some firms feel trying times are when real growth and change is possible.""As bad as the coronavirus is, it has provided the opportunity for many leaders in business and in governance to have a rethink,"" says Mr Karama of Finic in Sierra Leone. ""It is important that we leverage innovation...it is important that Africa learns to innovate, to monetise [and] not to import everything.""  ",22 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Universities fear fall in lucrative overseas students,"Which sector of the economy do you think is being hardest hit by the coronavirus - construction, retail, transport or catering?Well, you are all wrong, and need to do some more homework. The answer is - education.Many people probably don't even think of education as part of the economy. The groves of academe are surely above such sordid considerations as money and finance?Not a bit of it. Money is the lifeblood of education - endowments from wealthy alumni, catering and accommodation fees, conference facilities, and the biggest of the lot - attracting lots of fee-paying students every year. The trouble for the education sector is that it is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic.For hundreds of years its business model has been to bring thousands of people together from across the country, and around the world, to sit together in rooms for three years and talk to each other.As a result, nearly all its income streams are under attack at the same time.Current students have been sent home, and many courses have moved online. If lockdowns around the world continue, new students are going to be hard to find in the autumn, and even harder to get on campus.Plus, conferences are not happening, and all those wealthy alumni are nowhere near as wealthy as they thought they were.This hits Western English-speaking universities particularly hard. They tend to charge even domestic students large tuition fees, and make money out of on-site catering and accommodation on top of that.They also tend to charge foreign students a lot more, making them a huge source of income for many universities. In the UK, for example, undergraduate students from outside the UK and the EU can be charged annual tuition fees as high as £58,600 instead of the standard £9,000.So, while globalisation for many means importing cheaper manufactured goods from around the world, for developed economies one of their greatest recent economic successes has been attracting students from overseas.The rise of the middle classes around the world has been a godsend for Western universities, says Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at the University of Oxford.""The global middle classes have grown by leaps and bounds in recent decades, and anyone in that group can send their children abroad for education,"" he says.They have been doing just that, not least because many developing countries don't have the same quality of tertiary education as developed ones. This means that students who study abroad emerge with a prestigious degree, a second language, and lots of contacts and friends. It has proved a price worth paying for millions.The big winners in this regard have been the US, the UK and Australia. All with excellent education systems that teach in English, they can attract fee paying students from around the world.In the US, 360,000 Chinese students started the last academic year. The influx of foreign students is estimated to be worth as much as $45bn (£37bn) a year to the American economy.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:In Australia, foreign students are said to bring in more than 30bn Australian dollars a year ($20bn; £16bn), and it is a market that Australian universities have been targeting for years.Andrew Norton, professor of the practice of higher education policy at Australian National University in Canberra, says the country has been trying to attract foreign students from Asia since the 1980s.Australia has some distinct advantages for these students, he says. ""We are in much the same time zone, the climate is attractive, and there is the possibility of migrating here.""But the government in Canberra has not helped the sector very much, if at all, during this crisis. Prime Minister Scott Morrison even went as far as saying that foreign students should consider going back to their home countries if they could not support themselves during the lockdown.That message is hardly likely to encourage new students to feel welcome in future, and that matters, says Prof Norton, because ""there is a pipeline effect"".""If students don't start a degree course this year, then they are not here for three years,"" he says, meaning universities are going to be feeling the pressure of lost income for years to come, and not only in Australia.In the US the university sector is a massive business. Some of the oldest and most famous colleges have billions in reserve, massive endowments, and a reputation that means they can charge students top dollar. But even they are suffering being closed now.Many overseas students in the US are demanding rebates for lost lessons, and American universities make a small fortune from having students on site. Catering and accommodation are huge earners. Students in the UK have also been calling for refunds.Vijay Govindarajan, Coxe distinguished professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, says: ""I don't see how we can reopen and have campus classes this fall [autumn]"".Professor Marginson says that while universities have rushed to move courses online, at least temporarily, it is clear that they are not as attractive. ""Students, if given the choice, pick face-to-face teaching,"" he says. ""Online does not have the same prestige, and not just with employers, but with society as well.""In the UK, Cambridge University has announced that all its lectures will be online-only during the next academic year. However, it said it would review the situation if government guidance changed.  Colleges and universities around the world have moved rapidly towards online and remote teaching now, because they have to. When much of the world is in lockdown and social distancing is the norm, they have no choice, and it is the only way of keeping at least some money coming in.But it is not clear how many universities will survive the collapse of their income, and whether the move online will become permanent. Teaching people together on one site has proved to be a very long-lasting and successful business model, and it still carries huge prestige and rewards for those taking part.",21 May 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Coronavirus: Lufthansa agrees €9bn rescue deal with Germany,"Lufthansa has agreed a rescue deal worth €9bn (£8bn) with the German government that saves it from collapse.The German airline has been severely affected by a decline in travel due to the coronavirus and closed its budget airline Germanwings in April.The German government will take a 20% stake in the firm, which it intends to sell by the end of 2023.But the deal still has to be approved by the firm's shareholders and the European Commission.As part of the rescue package, the German government will also inject €5.7bn in non-voting capital, which is known as a ""silent participation"".Part of these funds can be converted into an additional 5% equity stake, which would enable the government to veto any potential hostile takeover bids. European markets rose on the news, with Lufthansa shares closing 7.5% higher, while Germany's Dax jumped 2%. The Frankfurt-based index closed at its highest level since 6 March.The Cac 40 index in France meanwhile rose 1.5%, and the pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 climbed 1.1%. Global airlines group IATA has said it expects airline passenger revenues to drop by more than 40% this year and warned that more than 25 million jobs in aviation and related industries are at risk.""The support that we're preparing here is for a limited period,"" said Germany's Finance Minister Olaf Scholz at a press conference on Monday.""When the company is fit again, the state will sell its stake and hopefully ... with a small profit that puts us into a position to finance the many, many requirements which we have to meet now, not only at this company.""The bailout deal is the result of weeks of talks between Lufthansa and the German government about financial aid and will help save up to 10,000 jobs.The German government has set aside a fund of €100bn to help shore up companies struck down by the pandemic. The airline had previously been operationally healthy and profitable with good prospects, but had run into trouble because of the coronavirus lockdown measures implemented by governments across the world.Lufthansa decommissioned more than 40 aircraft in April and said it would look to offload aircraft in its other businesses, which include Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Eurowings.The airline had warned that it does not expect demand for air travel to return for ""years"".Lufthansa is not the only national carrier that has needed to be rescued. On Sunday, the French and Dutch governments pledged a lifeline of more than €11bn in loans and guarantees to support Air France-KLM.Lufthansa has the most passenger traffic in Europe, followed by Air France-KLM, according to aviation analysts, the Centre for Aviation.The UK government has indicated that it is preparing its own plan to rescue large British firms.Last week, the bailout plan, named ""Project Birch"", was mentioned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps in Parliament during a discussion about the survival of the aviation industry.",25 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Government draws up plan to rescue key firms,"The UK government has indicated it is prepared to rescue large British companies severely affected by the coronavirus crisis.The Treasury said ""last resort"" support could be made available if a firm's failure would ""disproportionately harm the UK economy"".The move follows indications that a number of big firms are seeking government help to survive the crisis.These include Jaguar Land Rover, which is in talks to secure a £1bn loan.The government has already put in place various initiatives to help companies weather the pandemic, including loan programmes, deferring of tax payments and the furlough scheme, which allows workers to receive 80% of their salary paid by the government.According to latest figures, eight million workers are covered by the furlough scheme which has been extended until the end of October. But from August, businesses will be expected to meet part of the cost of the scheme. Concern is growing that some big firms are still in difficulties even after making use of these options.The bailout plan, named ""Project Birch"", was mentioned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps in Parliament last week when discussing the future of the aviation industry.It could involve the state taking stakes in companies, although extending existing loans would be preferable.Unite the union welcomed the plan but urged the government to act quickly.""There is no more time to lose if we are to prevent a tsunami of job losses from sweeping through communities this summer,"" said Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner.""We still need to ensure that proposed changes to the job retention scheme do not undermine a plan to recover and rebuild and that workers continue to get their wages."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We have put in place unprecedented levels of support to help businesses get through this crisis. ""Beyond that, many firms are getting support from established market mechanisms, such as existing shareholders, bank lending and commercial finance.""In exceptional circumstances, where a viable company has exhausted all options and its failure would disproportionately harm the economy, we may consider support on a 'last resort' basis. ""As the British public would expect, we are putting in place sensible contingency planning and any such support would be on terms that protect the taxpayer."" The BBC understands the Treasury would have to notify Parliament of any spend incurred, and although companies might seek financial assistance, this does not mean such support will be given.On Saturday, Sky News reported that Tata Steel, Britain's biggest steel producer, had approached both the Welsh and UK governments for financial aid that could run into hundreds of millions. Earlier this week, Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock told parliament that Tata Steel, which owns the steelworks in Port Talbot, needs around £500m in order to survive the pandemic. And according to the Financial Times, aviation industry bosses have been asking the government for a ""long-term investment facility"" that would help to support supply chains. Jim O'Neill, former Treasury minister and ex-chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told the newspaper he had been in discussion with government officials about creating a public sector-owned funding body to take stakes in firms that would be ""inherently stable"" in times of normal economic activity.

The man who sells 700 million sandwiches a year,"The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Patrick Coveney, chief executive of convenience food group Greencore.When you are the UK's largest maker of pre-packaged sandwiches the coronavirus lockdown is a significant problem.With everyone except key workers being asked to stay at home from 23 March, Greencore suddenly saw a vast drop in customer numbers.Supplying own-brand sandwiches to all the major supermarkets, and staff canteens - overnight there was hardly anybody in the UK's offices and other workplaces, to pop out in their lunch-break and buy a BLT or egg mayo.As a result, Greencore says its main ""food to go"" division, which usually sells 700 million sandwiches per year, plus salads and sushi, saw sales slump by 70% over the following month and a half.Patrick, who has led the Dublin-based and London-listed company since 2008 says it has been a ""period of unprecedented uncertainty"". And in an interview with Irish broadcaster RTE, he said it made previous worries about Brexit ""seem very trivial.In response to coronavirus, Greencore has shut three of its 16 UK facilities and furloughed 4,000 of its 11,500 employees. Patrick and his fellow board members have cut their own pay by 30%.He says he is proud of the staff that have remained in work, making sandwiches that include the ""thousands"" given for free to NHS workers across 20 UK hospitals.""Our people have been working around the clock to ensure that we can continue to provide high quality, fresh prepared food to both consumers and frontline workers during the pandemic.""Born in the Republic of Ireland in 1971, the 49-year-old is from a celebrated Irish family that is sometimes referred to as ""the Kennedys of County Cork"". Patrick's late father Hugh was a government minister in the 1990s. His brother Simon is the current tánaiste or deputy prime minister.After school Patrick gained a degree in commerce from the University College Cork. He then went to Oxford University, for a masters in management studies. He played rugby at both universities, and says the sport helped teach him ""the importance of building and working in great teams"".Oxford was followed by spending a decade at management consultants McKinsey, before he joined Greencore in 2005, as chief financial officer.Greencore had been set up in 1991 following the privatisation of the former state-owned Irish Sugar. It moved into convenience foods in 2001 before completely exiting the sugar business in 2006. In 2011 it switched its primary listing from the Irish Stock Exchange to London.While making sandwiches is the bulk of its business, it also produces a range of chilled prepared meals - everything from curries, to quiches and soups. The company says sales of these in first six weeks of the lockdown were higher than last year as people did more cooking at home. However, the rise was only as much as 5%.Although coronavirus is a challenge for Greencore, it is not the first major problem Patrick has had to deal with at the company. In 2008, only three months after he was promoted to chief executive, a £15m fraud was discovered at the company's Scottish water subsidiary Campsie.Patrick sacked three senior managers over the scandal. It was, he says, ""the most challenging moment"" of his professional life, and that it made him ""stronger and more determined as person and as a leader"".Retail analyst Nick Widdowson, founder of Shopper First, says that looking forward, a major issue facing Greencore and other makers of convenience food is how to reduce or remove the plastic packaging.""Providing ethically fresh, authentic, locally sourced product, together with sustainable packaging, will be key to any producer of convenience foods seeking to meet their consumers' changing expectations,"" he says.Patrick agrees. ""Two years ago I could make a balanced and consumer-friendly argument that packaging prolongs the life of food and produce items. [But] the world has moved on, plastic is seen as a problem, and so we need to find alternatives that are better for the environment.""More The Boss features:While Greencore's 2020 revenues and profits will inevitably be down on 2019's £1.5bn and £56.4m figures, the company says that sales of its pre-packaged sandwiches have now started to recover in recent weeks as more people have returned to work.It also said that a survey of 7,000 customers showed that many were now ""bored and frustrated"" with having to making their own lunches at home.""Greencore has an absolutely critical role to play in keeping the UK fed... and there is a powerful sense of commitment, skill, spirit, and purpose across the Greencore workforce in performing this role,"" says Patrick.",25 May 2020,business
Fresh UK review into Huawei role in 5G networks,"The UK government is conducting a new review into the impact of allowing Huawei telecoms equipment to be used in British 5G networks.The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) involvement comes after the US brought fresh sanctions against the Chinese company, citing security fears.In January, the UK resisted US pressure to ban Huawei from contributing to 5G.A NCSC spokesman said: ""The security and resilience of our networks is of paramount importance.""""Following the US announcement of additional sanctions against Huawei, the NCSC is looking carefully at any impact they could have to the UK's networks.""The sanctions restrict Huawei from using US technology and software to design its semiconductors.The US Department of Commerce is concerned Huawei has flouted regulations implemented last year that require the firm to obtain a licence in order to export US items.It says Huawei got around this rule by using US semiconductor manufacturing equipment at factories in other countries. The UK government had previously approved a limited role for Huawei in building the country's new mobile networks.The tech giant was banned from supplying kit to ""sensitive parts"" of the network, known as the core. In addition, it is only allowed to account for 35% of the kit in a network's periphery, which includes radio masts.UK mobile operators were told by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - that they would have three years to comply with caps on the use of Huawei equipment in their networks. Responding to the review, Victor Zhang, vice-president at Huawei, said: ""Our priority remains to continue the rollout of a reliable and secure 5G networks across Britain.""He added: ""We are happy to discuss with NCSC any concerns they may have and hope to continue the close working relationship we have enjoyed for the last 10 years.""Critics argue it is a security risk to allow the Chinese company to play any role at all in the UK's 5G network, due to fears it could be used by Beijing to spy on or even sabotage communications.In March, a backbench rebellion within the Conservative party signalled efforts to overturn the move. And on 4 April, a group of 15 Conservative MPs called for a rethink on relations with China in their own letter to the Prime Minister, written a day before he was admitted to hospital.In response, Huawei wrote an open letter to the UK government, urging it not to ""disrupt"" Huawei's involvement in the rollout of 5G.In January, after a prolonged and difficult debate, the government decided to allow Huawei to play a role in 5G but to limit its market share to 35% of the network and keep it out of the most sensitive parts. But there was a significant backbench rebellion over the issue in March and pressure has grown domestically since the Coronavirus crisis began to take a tougher line on China. At the same time the Trump administration has not let up in its campaign for the UK and other allies to exclude Huawei entirely. Even though this review is based on the technical considerations about the impact of US sanctions, it could potentially offer the government a route to move away from its earlier decision and exclude the company or impose further limits - although that may involve economic costs at home and increased tension with Beijing.Huawei stressed that the coronavirus pandemic had placed ""significant pressure"" on British telecoms systems and highlighted how many people in the country - particularly those living in rural communities - do not have good access to the internet.5G, which promises faster mobile internet data speeds, a stable network that can handle more connections, and more bandwidth for a multitude of different technological applications, has been touted as being a way to bridge the digital divide in areas where broadband internet rollouts have been inconsistent.According to latest data released by Huawei, the firm has so far won 91 5G contracts across the world.Huawei has always denied that it would help the Chinese government attack one of its clients.The firm's founder has said he would ""shut the company down"" rather than aid ""any spying activities"".Three out of four of the UK's mobile networks had already decided to use and deploy Huawei's 5G products outside the core in the ""periphery"", namely Vodafone, EE and Three.Two of them - Vodafone and EE - now face having to reduce their reliance on the supplier, as more than 35% of their existing radio access network equipment was made by it.",24 May 2020,business
