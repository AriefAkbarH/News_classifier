Coronavirus: France announces €8bn rescue plan for car industry,"The French government has announced an €8bn (£7.1bn) rescue plan for its car industry, which has been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. President Emmanuel Macron's proposal includes €1bn to provide grants of up to €7,000 to encourage citizens to purchase electric vehicles.It also puts money toward investments to make France a centre for electric vehicle output.The plan comes as the industry braces for thousands of job cuts.In return for the relief, the two main French car producers Renault and PSA have promised to focus production in France.""We need a motivational goal - make France Europe's top producer of clean vehicles by bringing output to more than one million electric and hybrid cars per year over the next five years,"" President Macron told reporters at a press conference at the Valeo car factory in Etaples, northern France on Tuesday.He added that no car model currently produced in France should be manufactured in other countries.To help sell the 400,000 vehicles languishing in car dealerships due to the coronavirus lockdown measures, President Macron said the government would also give people upgrading to a less polluting car a €3,000 bonus, as part of a scheme open to 75% of French households.""Our fellow citizens need to buy more vehicles, and in particular clean ones. Not in two, five or 10 years - now,"" he stressed. Like in other countries, France's car industry has ground to a halt - with an 80% fall in sales and a backlog of nearly half a million new vehicles waiting for owners.  President Macron - in his new post-virus spend-and-invest mode - wants to act now not just to rescue the industry from the immediate crisis,  but also to prepare it for a future that will be both electric and he hopes much less dependent on foreign and in particular Chinese suppliers. To boost demand now, the grants for households or companies that buy new electric cars are increased, as is the so-called conversion bonus for trading in a polluting car for a cleaner one.  The number of battery charge-points will be tripled to 100,000 by the end of next year. A billion euros in investment will be directed into research and modernising production, and there'll be a €5bn loan for Renault - part of the return for which is a promise by Renault to join a Franco-German consortium to develop car batteries.  The aim, Mr Macron said, is to have one million electric cars being made in France every year by 2025. According to IHS Markit, France was Europe's top producer of electric and hybrid cars in 2019, with almost 240,000 vehicles, but Germany is set to overtake it by the end of this year. The €8bn plan does not include an expected €5bn loan for embattled French carmaker Renault, which in February reported its first annual loss in a decade.The company has been planning to unveil a big restructuring plan on 29 May that was reportedly likely to see it close three factories in Choisy-le-Roi, Dieppe and Caudan. A fourth factory, Flins, will be converted into an electric battery factory. Mr Macron said on Tuesday that Renault had agreed to join a Franco-German project to produce electric batteries for the rechargeable auto industry, a step the government had set as a condition for the loan.But Mr Macron said the government would not sign off on the deal until Renault's management and unions had concluded talks over the carmaker's French workforce and plants in France.Mr Macron only guaranteed the future for employees of Renault's factories in Mauberge and Douai, however. And French daily national newspaper Le Figaro reported exclusively on Tuesday that Renault is planning to cut 5,000 jobs by 2024.The 370 employees that work at the Fonderie de Bretagne, near Lorient in north-western France, are concerned that the carmaker intends to close the factory. They have been protesting since Monday, blockading the factory, and told French national radio network Europe 1 that they intend to march on the streets of Lorient on Wednesday.",26 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: How can the car industry hope to recover?,"For weeks, the UK's motor industry has been in suspended animation.Showrooms have been closed. Vast factories, which normally produce hundreds of cars every day for sale here and abroad, have been standing idle. But now the sector is slowly shuddering back to life.So far only a handful of factories have resumed operations, among them BMW's engine plant at Hams Hall, just outside Birmingham, Bentley's headquarters in Crewe, and Toyota's engine facility at Deeside, North Wales.Others will follow next week, including the BMW Mini plant near Oxford, Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR's) sites in Solihull and Wolverhampton, Ford's engine factories in Dagenham and Bridgend, and Vauxhall's van manufacturing facility in Luton.But Nissan's factory in Sunderland will remain closed until June, JLR has yet to say when its Castle Bromwich and Halewood plants will reopen, and it is a similar story with Vauxhall's other site at Ellesmere Port.The trend is broadly similar in Europe, where major manufacturers such as PSA Group, Renault and Daimler are slowly bringing plants back online. Among those that have already reopened is the world's largest car factory, Volkswagen's huge facility in its home town of Wolfsburg.Part of the problem is that although car companies can decide when to reopen their plants, and to what extent they can resume production, there are other factors that they cannot control. Notably, they don't know when showrooms will be allowed to reopen, and when customers will actually want to buy new cars.The earliest that showrooms could potentially unlock their doors again in England is 1 June, as that is the date that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set for when ""non-essential"" retailers will hopefully be allowed to reopen. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not put down target dates.Vauxhall's managing director Stephen Norman has told BBC Newsnight that he wants UK showrooms to open as soon as possible.In the meantime, car buyers in England will now be able to order a vehicle online, and then go and pick it up from outside a dealership, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) trade body said on Wednesday. But under this ""click and collect"" scheme, the showrooms will remain closed.The future, for an industry that it is claimed supports more than 800,000 jobs in the UK, remains deeply uncertain.The crisis in the car industry began in February, when the Covid-19 outbreak in China forced factories to close, and sales in the country - one of its biggest global markets - collapsed. As the disease spread, so too did the disruption. An outbreak in Italy and the introduction of lockdowns there threatened European supply chains, and worse was to come as further restrictions were put in place in France. By mid-March shutdowns in the UK had become inevitable.There were three main concerns for manufacturers. Parts supplies were drying up because much of what was needed came from abroad. At the same time, showrooms were closing, and companies were becoming increasingly worried about the health of their staff.""These factors were all coming together at the same time,"" explains Jim Crosbie, managing director of Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK.""Demand had obviously dropped away, we were starting to get concerns about supply, and then of course the government was clearly taking more strict measures around safety.""Since then, we've had a skeleton crew going into each plant, just to make sure equipment was ticking over.""Car companies are accustomed to halting production lines from time to time, for maintenance, or to accommodate new designs, for example. But in this case, restarting the factories is much more of a challenge - largely because of the need to make them ""Covid-safe"" to protect staff from infection.Each manufacturer has its own plans. Vauxhall, for example, says it has put in place more than 100 measures to ensure the safety of employees at its plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton, when they reopen.Workers will have their temperatures checked on site, will wear safety glasses and masks, and will be expected to maintain a safe distance from one another.Similar steps are being taken at Toyota. The company restarted its engine plant on Deeside this week, to cater for demand from overseas markets. Its car assembly factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire is expected to resume work later this month. There is now a strong emphasis on maintaining social distancing in the factories. ""We have floor markings in all areas, but we've also changed some of our processes,"" explains Toyota's Deeside plant boss Tim Freeman.""We've put screening up to segregate certain processes. And where our employees take their breaks in rest areas, we've limited the occupancy of those areas, and created some temporary additional rest areas.""He says employees will also be given a ""multi-tool"" to do things like opening doors or operating push-button microwaves, in order to avoid touching surfaces that could harbour infection.All workers will have to wear masks and each of them will have an individual bottle of hand sanitiser to use. These measures, Mr Freeman stresses, have been drawn up in consultation with Unite, the factory workers' union.Unite representative Pete Tsouvallaris says he is very happy with the measures that have been drawn up. The problem now, he believes, is persuading shop floor staff that they really can come to work safely.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:""Many of our members are obviously worried because they haven't been on site yet,"" he says. ""Those who have been on site and have seen the steps that are being taken are less concerned. But what really doesn't help is the mixed messages coming from the government. It's confusing.""For Mr Tsouvallaris, the main concern is what happens when production gets under way in earnest. He is worried that workers might find it difficult to maintain all the new precautions.""Building cars is uncomfortable at the best of times,"" he says, ""so what is going to happen when it gets hot and you're wearing masks and lots of PPE?""The risk, he says, is that if production rates rise too quickly workers might become careless. He thinks it is essential that managers stay ""reasonable"" with their demands.He is also worried about what could happen at smaller suppliers, who have smaller premises and fewer resources than the big car firms. Reopening factories is just part of the story, however. Although some cars are sold online or through other remote channels, most still find their way to buyers through dealer showrooms - and in the UK, those showrooms remain closed.So it is no surprise that the first factories to reopen are those supplying markets abroad. JLR's Solihull plant, for example, makes models that are popular in China - where sales are recovering.Graham Hoare, chairman of Ford of Britain, thinks it is vital that British showrooms are able to open as soon as possible.""Dealerships being open is a fundamental requirement to selling cars,"" he says. ""The vast majority of our products go through dealerships.""Opening those dealerships… that really unblocks the cork out of the bottle that then allows the whole manufacturing system to flow.""That's already happened on the continent - in Germany and the rest of Europe. It's building, and we need to do the same here.""People will only buy cars if they can afford them though, and with the economy expected to go into a steep recession, that can not be guaranteed.""Invariably, if consumer confidence is low, you're looking at tightening belts,"" admits Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT.Nevertheless, he says it is essential that showrooms reopen soon.""If you reopen retail, you can stimulate demand… and that will help manufacturing.

Mr Macron said on Tuesday that Renault had agreed to join a Franco-German project to produce electric batteries for the rechargeable auto industry, a step the government had set as a condition for the loan.But Mr Macron said the government would not sign off on the deal until Renault's management and unions had concluded talks over the carmaker's French workforce and plants in France.Mr Macron only guaranteed the future for employees of Renault's factories in Mauberge and Douai, however. And French daily national newspaper Le Figaro reported exclusively on Tuesday that Renault is planning to cut 5,000 jobs by 2024.The 370 employees that work at the Fonderie de Bretagne, near Lorient in north-western France, are concerned that the carmaker intends to close the factory. They have been protesting since Monday, blockading the factory, and told French national radio network Europe 1 that they intend to march on the streets of Lorient on Wednesday.",26 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: How can the car industry hope to recover?,"For weeks, the UK's motor industry has been in suspended animation.Showrooms have been closed. Vast factories, which normally produce hundreds of cars every day for sale here and abroad, have been standing idle. But now the sector is slowly shuddering back to life.So far only a handful of factories have resumed operations, among them BMW's engine plant at Hams Hall, just outside Birmingham, Bentley's headquarters in Crewe, and Toyota's engine facility at Deeside, North Wales.Others will follow next week, including the BMW Mini plant near Oxford, Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR's) sites in Solihull and Wolverhampton, Ford's engine factories in Dagenham and Bridgend, and Vauxhall's van manufacturing facility in Luton.But Nissan's factory in Sunderland will remain closed until June, JLR has yet to say when its Castle Bromwich and Halewood plants will reopen, and it is a similar story with Vauxhall's other site at Ellesmere Port.The trend is broadly similar in Europe, where major manufacturers such as PSA Group, Renault and Daimler are slowly bringing plants back online. Among those that have already reopened is the world's largest car factory, Volkswagen's huge facility in its home town of Wolfsburg.Part of the problem is that although car companies can decide when to reopen their plants, and to what extent they can resume production, there are other factors that they cannot control. Notably, they don't know when showrooms will be allowed to reopen, and when customers will actually want to buy new cars.The earliest that showrooms could potentially unlock their doors again in England is 1 June, as that is the date that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set for when ""non-essential"" retailers will hopefully be allowed to reopen. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not put down target dates.Vauxhall's managing director Stephen Norman has told BBC Newsnight that he wants UK showrooms to open as soon as possible.In the meantime, car buyers in England will now be able to order a vehicle online, and then go and pick it up from outside a dealership, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) trade body said on Wednesday. But under this ""click and collect"" scheme, the showrooms will remain closed.The future, for an industry that it is claimed supports more than 800,000 jobs in the UK, remains deeply uncertain.The crisis in the car industry began in February, when the Covid-19 outbreak in China forced factories to close, and sales in the country - one of its biggest global markets - collapsed. As the disease spread, so too did the disruption. An outbreak in Italy and the introduction of lockdowns there threatened European supply chains, and worse was to come as further restrictions were put in place in France. By mid-March shutdowns in the UK had become inevitable.There were three main concerns for manufacturers. Parts supplies were drying up because much of what was needed came from abroad. At the same time, showrooms were closing, and companies were becoming increasingly worried about the health of their staff.""These factors were all coming together at the same time,"" explains Jim Crosbie, managing director of Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK.""Demand had obviously dropped away, we were starting to get concerns about supply, and then of course the government was clearly taking more strict measures around safety.""Since then, we've had a skeleton crew going into each plant, just to make sure equipment was ticking over.""Car companies are accustomed to halting production lines from time to time, for maintenance, or to accommodate new designs, for example. But in this case, restarting the factories is much more of a challenge - largely because of the need to make them ""Covid-safe"" to protect staff from infection.Each manufacturer has its own plans. Vauxhall, for example, says it has put in place more than 100 measures to ensure the safety of employees at its plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton, when they reopen.Workers will have their temperatures checked on site, will wear safety glasses and masks, and will be expected to maintain a safe distance from one another.Similar steps are being taken at Toyota. The company restarted its engine plant on Deeside this week, to cater for demand from overseas markets. Its car assembly factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire is expected to resume work later this month. There is now a strong emphasis on maintaining social distancing in the factories. ""We have floor markings in all areas, but we've also changed some of our processes,"" explains Toyota's Deeside plant boss Tim Freeman.""We've put screening up to segregate certain processes. And where our employees take their breaks in rest areas, we've limited the occupancy of those areas, and created some temporary additional rest areas.""He says employees will also be given a ""multi-tool"" to do things like opening doors or operating push-button microwaves, in order to avoid touching surfaces that could harbour infection.All workers will have to wear masks and each of them will have an individual bottle of hand sanitiser to use. These measures, Mr Freeman stresses, have been drawn up in consultation with Unite, the factory workers' union.Unite representative Pete Tsouvallaris says he is very happy with the measures that have been drawn up. The problem now, he believes, is persuading shop floor staff that they really can come to work safely.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:""Many of our members are obviously worried because they haven't been on site yet,"" he says. ""Those who have been on site and have seen the steps that are being taken are less concerned. But what really doesn't help is the mixed messages coming from the government. It's confusing.""For Mr Tsouvallaris, the main concern is what happens when production gets under way in earnest. He is worried that workers might find it difficult to maintain all the new precautions.""Building cars is uncomfortable at the best of times,"" he says, ""so what is going to happen when it gets hot and you're wearing masks and lots of PPE?""The risk, he says, is that if production rates rise too quickly workers might become careless. He thinks it is essential that managers stay ""reasonable"" with their demands.He is also worried about what could happen at smaller suppliers, who have smaller premises and fewer resources than the big car firms. Reopening factories is just part of the story, however. Although some cars are sold online or through other remote channels, most still find their way to buyers through dealer showrooms - and in the UK, those showrooms remain closed.So it is no surprise that the first factories to reopen are those supplying markets abroad. JLR's Solihull plant, for example, makes models that are popular in China - where sales are recovering.Graham Hoare, chairman of Ford of Britain, thinks it is vital that British showrooms are able to open as soon as possible.""Dealerships being open is a fundamental requirement to selling cars,"" he says. ""The vast majority of our products go through dealerships.""Opening those dealerships… that really unblocks the cork out of the bottle that then allows the whole manufacturing system to flow.""That's already happened on the continent - in Germany and the rest of Europe. It's building, and we need to do the same here.""People will only buy cars if they can afford them though, and with the economy expected to go into a steep recession, that can not be guaranteed.""Invariably, if consumer confidence is low, you're looking at tightening belts,"" admits Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT.Nevertheless, he says it is essential that showrooms reopen soon.""If you reopen retail, you can stimulate demand… and that will help manufacturing. Do that right and the benefits in terms of the economy, and in terms of people's jobs and livelihoods will be felt pretty quickly.""",14 May 2020,business
"Coronavirus furlough scheme to finish at end of October, says chancellor","The UK's coronavirus furlough scheme will finish at the end of October, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed. At the No 10 briefing, Mr Sunak also set out how employers will have to start sharing the cost of the scheme.From August, employers must pay National Insurance and pension contributions, then 10% of pay from September, rising to 20% in October.Also, workers will be allowed to return to work part-time from July, but with companies paying 100% of wages.Mr Sunak said the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will adjust so ""those who are able to work can do so"".Some 8.4 million workers are having 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to £2,500 a month - under the scheme, which was originally intended to last until the end of July. Earlier this month, the chancellor extended the scheme until the end of October, but did not spell out how employers would start contributing.Under Friday's changes, furloughed workers will continue to get 80% of pay until the end of October, but by then a fifth of their salary will have to be met by employers.""Then, after eight months of this extraordinary intervention of the government stepping in to help pay people's wages, the scheme will close,"" Mr Sunak said.Asked if he would ""switch the furlough scheme back on"" in the case of a second peak in cases and the reintroduction of lockdown measures, the chancellor said the scheme ""as it stands in a national way, in the way that it is designed"" will end in October.""Eight months, as I said, is I think a generous and long period of time,"" he said.The chancellor is attempting a delicate balancing act.Slowly withdrawing very expensive government support programmes without crashing the economy.Cash-strapped employers must decide if they can take on an increasing burden to keep workers for whom there may be little or no work.The chancellor says the government can't go on meeting the full cost of the furlough scheme.But the withdrawal is more gradual than many had feared and the government hopes that the support withdrawal will be mirrored by business demand recovering.We may be about to find out how many real jobs are left in the post-coronavirus economy.Read more from Simon here.Employers' claims under the scheme have reached £15bn so far, however the scheme is expected to cost a total of around £80bn, or £10bn a month. The Office for Budget Responsibility is set to publish detailed costings next week.It comes as the latest UK-wide figures show another 324 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in hospitals and the wider community, bringing the total to 38,161.Some 131,458 people were tested for coronavirus on Thursday, with 2,095 more positive cases reported.Restaurateur David Moore told the BBC he is ""deeply, deeply worried"" about the changes to the scheme.Mr Moore, who owns London restaurant Pied a Terre, said it is unfair for hospitality firms to start paying towards wages when they do not have any revenues.""It is massively disappointing and sheer lunacy to try to get an industry who hasn't had any revenues for what will be then probably five months, to ask them to start contributing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.He warned that some businesses could go bust as a result.""Will we have any money coming through the door to help contribute? If we don't it is all too late, a lot of businesses are heading down the pan.""Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds also warned about job losses.""It is concerning that there is no commitment within these plans for support to only be scaled back in step with the removal of lockdown,"" she said. ""Nor is there any analysis of the impact on unemployment of a 'one size fits all' approach being adopted across all sectors.""From 1 July, businesses will be allowed to bring furloughed employees back part-time, a month earlier than previously announced. The move is aimed to help support people back to work, the government said. It will be down to individual firms to decide what part-time means. They will be able to set the hours and shift patterns staff will work when they return, but companies will have to pay wages while they are in work.""Extending the job retention scheme and making it more flexible is key to getting the economy back on its feet,"" said Federation of Small Businesses national chairman Mike Cherry.""By providing employers with the adaptability they'll require as businesses adjust to a new normal, and bringing forward the flexible furlough launch date, the government is giving hope to small firms right across the UK.""From 1 August the level of government grant will be reduced ""to reflect that people are returning to work"". Furloughed workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay, but from August it will include a growing employer contribution. It will start with bosses paying NI and pensions in August, plus 10% of pay in September, rising to 20% in October.During August the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of £2,500. Employers will have to pay NI and pension contributions. For the average claim, that's 5% of the gross employment costs the employer would have incurred had the employee had not been furloughed.In September, the government will cut its grants to 70% of wages up to a cap of £2,190. Employers will pay NI and pension contributions and 10% of wages to make up the 80% total up to a cap of £2,500. That works out at 14% of the average gross employment costs the employer would have incurred.In October the government grant will be cut to 60% of wages up to a cap of £1,875. Employers will pay NI and pension contributions and 20% of wages to make up the 80% total up to a cap of £2,500. That's 23% of the gross employment costs the employer would have incurred had the employee not been furloughed.",29 May 2020,business
Kylie Jenner: Forbes drops celebrity from billionaire list,"Forbes magazine has struck reality TV star and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner from its list of billionaires, and accused her family of inflating the value of her cosmetics business.Forbes said the family went to ""unusual lengths"" to present its youngest member as richer than she was.In tweets, Jenner dismissed the article as ""inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol"".""I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there,"" she wrote.""I can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money I have,"" she added.The move reverses the status Forbes conferred on Jenner in 2019, when it declared her a self-made billionaire.The description sparked controversy, with critics scoffing at the ""self-made"" title and pointing to her upbringing as a Kardashian family reality TV star.Forbes, which is known for its widely cited billionaire rankings, credited Jenner's status to the success of her cosmetics company, which she founded in 2015 and which includes Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin.Jenner last year announced she was selling a 51% stake in the company to beauty giant Coty for $600m. Forbes said the family's accountant had provided it with tax returns that suggested the firm had done more than $300m in sales in 2016 and that publicists claimed sales of $330m the following year.But information shared by Coty, which is publicly traded, showed Jenner's firm is ""significantly smaller and less profitable than the family has spent years leading the cosmetics industry and media outlets, including Forbes, to believe"", Forbes said.Coty's presentation to investors about the business suggested the firm did only $125m in sales in 2018.""If Kylie Cosmetics did $125 million in sales in 2018, how could it have done $307 million in 2016 (as the company's supposed tax returns state) or $330 million in 2017?"" Forbes asked in the article.Despite the magazine's downgrade, Jenner is hardly hurting.Forbes said she pocketed $340m from the sale of her business. It now estimates her net worth at ""just under $900m"".Forbes writers have previously accused other would-be billionaires of inflating their riches, including US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and President Donald Trump.",29 May 2020,business
"Rishi Sunak wants firms to pay more, but also survive","The Chancellor is attempting a delicate balancing act. Slowly withdrawing very expensive government support programmes without crashing the economy. The government is currently paying 80% of the wages of nearly 8.5 million employees and 80% of 2.3 million self employed worker's take home pay till the end of July at cost in the many tens of billions of pounds. As the economy emerges from lockdown that will change. From 1 July, employers will be able to bring in workers part-time and pay them for the time worked. That is a month early, has been widely called for and will be welcomed. Then the hard part starts. From August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension costs for furloughed workers. From September, those contributions plus 10% of their wages and from 1 October, employers must pay 20% until the scheme ends at the end of the month.Crucially, If employers don't contribute - neither will the government. Cash-strapped employers must decide if they can take on an increasing burden to keep workers for whom there may be little or no work.The chancellor said the government couldn't go on meeting the full cost of the scheme.The hospitality industry has been particularly hard hit by the lockdown, and it will face further difficulties because of the need to maintain social distancing and potential future customer reticence to return when pubs and restaurants reopen.The chancellor resisted calls for special treatment of this or other hard-hit sectors. David Moore is a restaurateur who owns the Michelin-starred Pied a Terre, in London. He's worried the additional costs announced by the chancellor could mean jobs would be lost.""It would be a real shame if the retention scheme turned out to be a very, very glorified waiting room for the unemployed. And I feel that if we come back with any level of uncertainty - a lot of businesses will cut harder and further than maybe they thought of doing first""There was also an important announcement for self employed - who got a cash grant for March - June capped at £7,500. They will now get a maximum and final payment of £6,570 in August.The withdrawal is more gradual than many had feared and the government hopes that the support withdrawal will be mirrored by business demand recovering. But we may be about to find out how many real jobs are left in the post-coronavirus economy.",29 May 2020,business
Virus-hit self-employed to receive second payment,"Self-employed people whose work has been affected by coronavirus will receive a ""second and final"" grant in August, the government says.More than two million people have applied for a single grant of up to £7,500 so far.They, and other self-employed people, will be eligible for a second payment in August of up to £6,570, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced.It comes as details of the extended furlough scheme were also outlined.Until now, self-employed workers who qualify have been in line for a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to £2,500 a month for three months. This is being paid in one instalment.Some 2.3 million of these workers have signed up for grants totalling £6.8bn.Those whose work has been affected by coronavirus will still be able to apply for this lump sum until 13 July.At the government's daily press conference, Mr Sunak has now announced applications for a second taxable grant will open in August.This will be slightly less generous, covering 70% of the applicant's average monthly trading profits.It will also be made in a single payment, covering three months and capped at £2,190 a month, or £6,570 in total. Applicants will need to confirm their work has been affected by the virus, but they would not need to have taken the first grant to be eligible for the second.One of those eligible is musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam, who has seen work dry up since her show at the Royal Shakespeare Company was cancelled at the start of lockdown.She was worried that without more support she would not have known how she would feed herself, having paid many essential bills using savings, but she still worries about the long-term outlook if people are unable or slow to return to arts venues.""Another grant would make things more manageable in the immediate future, but hopefully it is not just a short-term plug,"" she said.""I hope this is the beginning of looking into the bigger problems for the arts.""The announcement comes after a cross-party group of 113 MPs signed a letter sent by Labour's Siobhain McDonagh to Mr Sunak calling for more support for the self-employed.It warned that failing to offer an extension would ""would pull the safety net from under the feet of millions of self-employed workers"".Mr Sunak also announced more details of how the furlough scheme for employees will be paid for in the coming months.That scheme has been extended until October.The Treasury says that there is not direct parity between the two schemes but, unlike furloughed workers, the self-employed could technically continue with some work while receiving support from the government. ""Our five million-strong self-employed community will be greatly relieved to know that the income cliff-edge they were facing in two days' time has now been removed,"" said Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses. ""The hope is that more and more sole traders will be able to return to work safely as restrictions are eased. Policymakers have rightly recognised that self-employed business owners working in a lot of sectors - not least hair and beauty, events and travel - will be massively impacted by the current downturn for many weeks to come.He added that more should now be done for those not receiving these payments.A number of self-employed people, such as directors who pay themselves in dividends and the newly self-employed, are unhappy at missing out on the government's self-employment support package.",29 May 2020,business
"Renault cuts 15,000 jobs in major restructuring","Renault is cutting 15,000 jobs worldwide as part of a €2bn (£1.8bn) cost-cutting plan after seeing sales plunge because of the virus pandemic.""This plan is essential,"" said interim boss Clotilde Delbos, who announced a bigger focus on electric cars and vans.Some 4,600 jobs will go in France, and Renault has said six plants are under review for possible cuts and closure.Renault played down reports it could move some production to the UK plant run by its strategic partner Nissan.""You shouldn't believe everything you read in the newspapers,"" Ms Delbos said. ""All you've seen in the newspapers are but rumours.""On Thursday, Nissan unveiled huge job cuts and the closure of its factory in Barcelona. The UK plant, in Sunderland, would remain open, the Japanese company said.Renault, 15% owned by the French state and which is in talks with the government about an €8bn loan, has begun negotiations with unions about which factories could shut.The company is slashing costs by cutting the number of subcontractors in areas such as engineering, reducing the number of components it uses, freezing expansion plans in Romania and Morocco and shrinking gearbox manufacturing worldwide.The French firm plans to trim its global production capacity to 3.3 million vehicles in 2024 from 4 million now, focusing on areas like small vans or electric cars.Renault is part of a three-way alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi. On Thursday, Nissan said it would close its factory in Barcelona with the loss of about 2,800 jobs in a bid to cut costs, prompting protests at the Spanish plant.Cost-cutting measures announced by both Renault and Nissan mark a departure from the ambitious expansion plan devised by now-ousted leader of the alliance, Carlos Ghosn.Renault's interim chief executive Ms Delbos said during a press conference on Friday: ""We have to change our mindset.""We're not looking to be on top of the world, what we want is a sustainable and profitable company.""Renault, which claims more than 4% of the global car market, said its plans would affect about 10% of its 179,000-strong global workforce and cost up to €1.2bn (£1.1bn).Ms Delbos added that Renault would review each region in order to decide where job cuts will fall. ""This will help us come back to our ideal size,"" she said.Both Nissan and Renault were already facing falling sales before the Covid-19 outbreak worsened trading. Renault's sales were down 3% last year and the number of vehicles sold in the first three months of 2020 fell by 25%, before dropping further in April. The struggling firm is currently in talks with the French government over a €5bn emergency loan package.The French government has also pledged €8bn in wider rescue funds aimed at shoring up the country's car industry. In exchange, President Emmanuel Macron had said Renault should keep workers and production in the country.We're coming ""back to bases"" was how Renault euphemistically portrayed its retrenchment after seeing a collapse in sales and profits. Former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn had targeted 5 million car sales by 2022. Today's restructuring sees the company cut maximum production capacity to 3.3 million vehicles by 2024. The news does more than rip up Renault's previous strategy. It reveals more of the shape of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance. While they will co-operate on cutting costs, each company will take the lead on certain new-car developments. And there's a geographical split: Renault focusing on Europe and Russia, Nissan on China, Japan and the US, and Mitsubishi on South East Asia. The days when the carmakers were tipped to merge into one global titan are long gone.Presenting the plan is the easy bit; far more difficult is the execution. Renault has too many brands, and was slow to capitalise on growing markets. Its cost base is high. French rival PSA, for example, uses the same engines, chassis and gearbox on most small cars. Renault's technical base is not as efficient.And it was telling that Renault did not say which French sites would shut. Among the 15,000 job cuts worldwide is 10% of Renault's domestic workforce. The government has still to sign off on a loan to Renault, so there will be hard bargaining with the unions before the money is handed over.That might explain why Renault today played down reports it could put some production into Nissan's UK plant at Sunderland. Having French taxpayers help prop up a company that then creates jobs in the UK is not a good look.",29 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: France announces €8bn rescue plan for car industry,"The French government has announced an €8bn (£7.1bn) rescue plan for its car industry, which has been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. President Emmanuel Macron's proposal includes €1bn to provide grants of up to €7,000 to encourage citizens to purchase electric vehicles.It also puts money toward investments to make France a centre for electric vehicle output.The plan comes as the industry braces for thousands of job cuts.In return for the relief, the two main French car producers Renault and PSA have promised to focus production in France.""We need a motivational goal - make France Europe's top producer of clean vehicles by bringing output to more than one million electric and hybrid cars per year over the next five years,"" President Macron told reporters at a press conference at the Valeo car factory in Etaples, northern France on Tuesday.He added that no car model currently produced in France should be manufactured in other countries.To help sell the 400,000 vehicles languishing in car dealerships due to the coronavirus lockdown measures, President Macron said the government would also give people upgrading to a less polluting car a €3,000 bonus, as part of a scheme open to 75% of French households.""Our fellow citizens need to buy more vehicles, and in particular clean ones. Not in two, five or 10 years - now,"" he stressed. Like in other countries, France's car industry has ground to a halt - with an 80% fall in sales and a backlog of nearly half a million new vehicles waiting for owners.  President Macron - in his new post-virus spend-and-invest mode - wants to act now not just to rescue the industry from the immediate crisis,  but also to prepare it for a future that will be both electric and he hopes much less dependent on foreign and in particular Chinese suppliers. To boost demand now, the grants for households or companies that buy new electric cars are increased, as is the so-called conversion bonus for trading in a polluting car for a cleaner one.  The number of battery charge-points will be tripled to 100,000 by the end of next year. A billion euros in investment will be directed into research and modernising production, and there'll be a €5bn loan for Renault - part of the return for which is a promise by Renault to join a Franco-German consortium to develop car batteries.  The aim, Mr Macron said, is to have one million electric cars being made in France every year by 2025. According to IHS Markit, France was Europe's top producer of electric and hybrid cars in 2019, with almost 240,000 vehicles, but Germany is set to overtake it by the end of this year. The €8bn plan does not include an expected €5bn loan for embattled French carmaker Renault, which in February reported its first annual loss in a decade.The company has been planning to unveil a big restructuring plan on 29 May that was reportedly likely to see it close three factories in Choisy-le-Roi, Dieppe and Caudan. A fourth factory, Flins, will be converted into an electric battery factory. Mr Macron said on Tuesday that Renault had agreed to join a Franco-German project to produce electric batteries for the rechargeable auto industry, a step the government had set as a condition for the loan.But Mr Macron said the government would not sign off on the deal until Renault's management and unions had concluded talks over the carmaker's French workforce and plants in France.Mr Macron only guaranteed the future for employees of Renault's factories in Mauberge and Douai, however. And French daily national newspaper Le Figaro reported exclusively on Tuesday that Renault is planning to cut 5,000 jobs by 2024.The 370 employees that work at the Fonderie de Bretagne, near Lorient in north-western France, are concerned that the carmaker intends to close the factory. They have been protesting since Monday, blockading the factory, and told French national radio network Europe 1 that they intend to march on the streets of Lorient on Wednesday.",26 May 2020,business

Among those that have already reopened is the world's largest car factory, Volkswagen's huge facility in its home town of Wolfsburg.Part of the problem is that although car companies can decide when to reopen their plants, and to what extent they can resume production, there are other factors that they cannot control.

But under this ""click and collect"" scheme, the showrooms will remain closed.The future, for an industry that it is claimed supports more than 800,000 jobs in the UK, remains deeply uncertain.The crisis in the car industry began in February, when the Covid-19 outbreak in China forced factories to close, and sales in the country - one of its biggest global markets - collapsed. As the disease spread, so too did the disruption. An outbreak in Italy and the introduction of lockdowns there threatened European supply chains, and worse was to come as further restrictions were put in place in France. By mid-March shutdowns in the UK had become inevitable.There were three main concerns for manufacturers. Parts supplies were drying up because much of what was needed came from abroad. At the same time, showrooms were closing, and companies were becoming increasingly worried about the health of their staff.""These factors were all coming together at the same time,"" explains Jim Crosbie, managing director of Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK.""Demand had obviously dropped away, we were starting to get concerns about supply, and then of course the government was clearly taking more strict measures around safety.""Since then, we've had a skeleton crew going into each plant, just to make sure equipment was ticking over.""Car companies are accustomed to halting production lines from time to time, for maintenance, or to accommodate new designs, for example.

Vauxhall, for example, says it has put in place more than 100 measures to ensure the safety of employees at its plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton, when they reopen.Workers will have their temperatures checked on site, will wear safety glasses and masks, and will be expected to maintain a safe distance from one another.Similar steps are being taken at Toyota.

Coronavirus: France announces €8bn rescue plan for car industry,"The French government has announced an €8bn (£7.1bn) rescue plan for its car industry, which has been severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. President Emmanuel Macron's proposal includes €1bn to provide grants of up to €7,000 to encourage citizens to purchase electric vehicles.It also puts money toward investments to make France a centre for electric vehicle output.The plan comes as the industry braces for thousands of job cuts.In return for the relief, the two main French car producers Renault and PSA have promised to focus production in France.""We need a motivational goal - make France Europe's top producer of clean vehicles by bringing output to more than one million electric and hybrid cars per year over the next five years,"" President Macron told reporters at a press conference at the Valeo car factory in Etaples, northern France on Tuesday.He added that no car model currently produced in France should be manufactured in other countries.To help sell the 400,000 vehicles languishing in car dealerships due to the coronavirus lockdown measures, President Macron said the government would also give people upgrading to a less polluting car a €3,000 bonus, as part of a scheme open to 75% of French households.""Our fellow citizens need to buy more vehicles, and in particular clean ones. Not in two, five or 10 years - now,"" he stressed. Like in other countries, France's car industry has ground to a halt - with an 80% fall in sales and a backlog of nearly half a million new vehicles waiting for owners.  President Macron - in his new post-virus spend-and-invest mode - wants to act now not just to rescue the industry from the immediate crisis,  but also to prepare it for a future that will be both electric and he hopes much less dependent on foreign and in particular Chinese suppliers. To boost demand now, the grants for households or companies that buy new electric cars are increased, as is the so-called conversion bonus for trading in a polluting car for a cleaner one.  The number of battery charge-points will be tripled to 100,000 by the end of next year. A billion euros in investment will be directed into research and modernising production, and there'll be a €5bn loan for Renault - part of the return for which is a promise by Renault to join a Franco-German consortium to develop car batteries.  The aim, Mr Macron said, is to have one million electric cars being made in France every year by 2025. According to IHS Markit, France was Europe's top producer of electric and hybrid cars in 2019, with almost 240,000 vehicles, but Germany is set to overtake it by the end of this year. The €8bn plan does not include an expected €5bn loan for embattled French carmaker Renault, which in February reported its first annual loss in a decade.The company has been planning to unveil a big restructuring plan on 29 May that was reportedly likely to see it close three factories in Choisy-le-Roi, Dieppe and Caudan. A fourth factory, Flins, will be converted into an electric battery factory. Mr Macron said on Tuesday that Renault had agreed to join a Franco-German project to produce electric batteries for the rechargeable auto industry, a step the government had set as a condition for the loan.But Mr Macron said the government would not sign off on the deal until Renault's management and unions had concluded talks over the carmaker's French workforce and plants in France.Mr Macron only guaranteed the future for employees of Renault's factories in Mauberge and Douai, however. And French daily national newspaper Le Figaro reported exclusively on Tuesday that Renault is planning to cut 5,000 jobs by 2024.The 370 employees that work at the Fonderie de Bretagne, near Lorient in north-western France, are concerned that the carmaker intends to close the factory. They have been protesting since Monday, blockading the factory, and told French national radio network Europe 1 that they intend to march on the streets of Lorient on Wednesday.",26 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: How can the car industry hope to recover?,"For weeks, the UK's motor industry has been in suspended animation.Showrooms have been closed. Vast factories, which normally produce hundreds of cars every day for sale here and abroad, have been standing idle. But now the sector is slowly shuddering back to life.So far only a handful of factories have resumed operations, among them BMW's engine plant at Hams Hall, just outside Birmingham, Bentley's headquarters in Crewe, and Toyota's engine facility at Deeside, North Wales.Others will follow next week, including the BMW Mini plant near Oxford, Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR's) sites in Solihull and Wolverhampton, Ford's engine factories in Dagenham and Bridgend, and Vauxhall's van manufacturing facility in Luton.But Nissan's factory in Sunderland will remain closed until June, JLR has yet to say when its Castle Bromwich and Halewood plants will reopen, and it is a similar story with Vauxhall's other site at Ellesmere Port.The trend is broadly similar in Europe, where major manufacturers such as PSA Group, Renault and Daimler are slowly bringing plants back online. Among those that have already reopened is the world's largest car factory, Volkswagen's huge facility in its home town of Wolfsburg.Part of the problem is that although car companies can decide when to reopen their plants, and to what extent they can resume production, there are other factors that they cannot control. Notably, they don't know when showrooms will be allowed to reopen, and when customers will actually want to buy new cars.The earliest that showrooms could potentially unlock their doors again in England is 1 June, as that is the date that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set for when ""non-essential"" retailers will hopefully be allowed to reopen. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not put down target dates.Vauxhall's managing director Stephen Norman has told BBC Newsnight that he wants UK showrooms to open as soon as possible.In the meantime, car buyers in England will now be able to order a vehicle online, and then go and pick it up from outside a dealership, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) trade body said on Wednesday. But under this ""click and collect"" scheme, the showrooms will remain closed.The future, for an industry that it is claimed supports more than 800,000 jobs in the UK, remains deeply uncertain.The crisis in the car industry began in February, when the Covid-19 outbreak in China forced factories to close, and sales in the country - one of its biggest global markets - collapsed. As the disease spread, so too did the disruption. An outbreak in Italy and the introduction of lockdowns there threatened European supply chains, and worse was to come as further restrictions were put in place in France. By mid-March shutdowns in the UK had become inevitable.There were three main concerns for manufacturers. Parts supplies were drying up because much of what was needed came from abroad. At the same time, showrooms were closing, and companies were becoming increasingly worried about the health of their staff.""These factors were all coming together at the same time,"" explains Jim Crosbie, managing director of Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK.""Demand had obviously dropped away, we were starting to get concerns about supply, and then of course the government was clearly taking more strict measures around safety.""Since then, we've had a skeleton crew going into each plant, just to make sure equipment was ticking over.""Car companies are accustomed to halting production lines from time to time, for maintenance, or to accommodate new designs, for example. But in this case, restarting the factories is much more of a challenge - largely because of the need to make them ""Covid-safe"" to protect staff from infection.Each manufacturer has its own plans. Vauxhall, for example, says it has put in place more than 100 measures to ensure the safety of employees at its plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton, when they reopen.Workers will have their temperatures checked on site, will wear safety glasses and masks, and will be expected to maintain a safe distance from one another.Similar steps are being taken at Toyota. The company restarted its engine plant on Deeside this week, to cater for demand from overseas markets. Its car assembly factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire is expected to resume work later this month. There is now a strong emphasis on maintaining social distancing in the factories. ""We have floor markings in all areas, but we've also changed some of our processes,"" explains Toyota's Deeside plant boss Tim Freeman.""We've put screening up to segregate certain processes.

"Coronavirus furlough scheme to finish at end of October, says chancellor","The UK's coronavirus furlough scheme will finish at the end of October, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed. At the No 10 briefing, Mr Sunak also set out how employers will have to start sharing the cost of the scheme.From August, employers must pay National Insurance and pension contributions, then 10% of pay from September, rising to 20% in October.Also, workers will be allowed to return to work part-time from July, but with companies paying 100% of wages.Mr Sunak said the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will adjust so ""those who are able to work can do so"".Some 8.4 million workers are having 80% of their salaries paid for by the government - up to £2,500 a month - under the scheme, which was originally intended to last until the end of July. Earlier this month, the chancellor extended the scheme until the end of October, but did not spell out how employers would start contributing.Under Friday's changes, furloughed workers will continue to get 80% of pay until the end of October, but by then a fifth of their salary will have to be met by employers.""Then, after eight months of this extraordinary intervention of the government stepping in to help pay people's wages, the scheme will close,"" Mr Sunak said.Asked if he would ""switch the furlough scheme back on"" in the case of a second peak in cases and the reintroduction of lockdown measures, the chancellor said the scheme ""as it stands in a national way, in the way that it is designed"" will end in October.""Eight months, as I said, is I think a generous and long period of time,"" he said.The chancellor is attempting a delicate balancing act.Slowly withdrawing very expensive government support programmes without crashing the economy.Cash-strapped employers must decide if they can take on an increasing burden to keep workers for whom there may be little or no work.The chancellor says the government can't go on meeting the full cost of the furlough scheme.But the withdrawal is more gradual than many had feared and the government hopes that the support withdrawal will be mirrored by business demand recovering.We may be about to find out how many real jobs are left in the post-coronavirus economy.Read more from Simon here.Employers' claims under the scheme have reached £15bn so far, however the scheme is expected to cost a total of around £80bn, or £10bn a month. The Office for Budget Responsibility is set to publish detailed costings next week.It comes as the latest UK-wide figures show another 324 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in hospitals and the wider community, bringing the total to 38,161.Some 131,458 people were tested for coronavirus on Thursday, with 2,095 more positive cases reported.Restaurateur David Moore told the BBC he is ""deeply, deeply worried"" about the changes to the scheme.Mr Moore, who owns London restaurant Pied a Terre, said it is unfair for hospitality firms to start paying towards wages when they do not have any revenues.""It is massively disappointing and sheer lunacy to try to get an industry who hasn't had any revenues for what will be then probably five months, to ask them to start contributing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.He warned that some businesses could go bust as a result.""Will we have any money coming through the door to help contribute?

""Nor is there any analysis of the impact on unemployment of a 'one size fits all' approach being adopted across all sectors.""From 1 July, businesses will be allowed to bring furloughed employees back part-time, a month earlier than previously announced. The move is aimed to help support people back to work, the government said. It will be down to individual firms to decide what part-time means.

Furloughed workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay, but from August it will include a growing employer contribution. It will start with bosses paying NI and pensions in August, plus 10% of pay in September, rising to 20% in October.During August the government will pay 80% of wages up to a cap of £2,500.

Kylie Jenner: Forbes drops celebrity from billionaire list,"Forbes magazine has struck reality TV star and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner from its list of billionaires, and accused her family of inflating the value of her cosmetics business.Forbes said the family went to ""unusual lengths"" to present its youngest member as richer than she was.In tweets, Jenner dismissed the article as ""inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol"".""I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there,"" she wrote.""I can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money I have,"" she added.The move reverses the status Forbes conferred on Jenner in 2019, when it declared her a self-made billionaire.The description sparked controversy, with critics scoffing at the ""self-made"" title and pointing to her upbringing as a Kardashian family reality TV star.Forbes, which is known for its widely cited billionaire rankings, credited Jenner's status to the success of her cosmetics company, which she founded in 2015 and which includes Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin.Jenner last year announced she was selling a 51% stake in the company to beauty giant Coty for $600m. Forbes said the family's accountant had provided it with tax returns that suggested the firm had done more than $300m in sales in 2016 and that publicists claimed sales of $330m the following year.But information shared by Coty, which is publicly traded, showed Jenner's firm is ""significantly smaller and less profitable than the family has spent years leading the cosmetics industry and media outlets, including Forbes, to believe"", Forbes said.Coty's presentation to investors about the business suggested the firm did only $125m in sales in 2018.""If Kylie Cosmetics did $125 million in sales in 2018, how could it have done $307 million in 2016 (as the company's supposed tax returns state) or $330 million in 2017?"" Forbes asked in the article.Despite the magazine's downgrade, Jenner is hardly hurting.Forbes said she pocketed $340m from the sale of her business. It now estimates her net worth at ""just under $900m"".Forbes writers have previously accused other would-be billionaires of inflating their riches, including US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and President Donald Trump.",29 May 2020,business
"Rishi Sunak wants firms to pay more, but also survive","The Chancellor is attempting a delicate balancing act. Slowly withdrawing very expensive government support programmes without crashing the economy. The government is currently paying 80% of the wages of nearly 8.5 million employees and 80% of 2.3 million self employed worker's take home pay till the end of July at cost in the many tens of billions of pounds. As the economy emerges from lockdown that will change. From 1 July, employers will be able to bring in workers part-time and pay them for the time worked. That is a month early, has been widely called for and will be welcomed. Then the hard part starts. From August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension costs for furloughed workers. From September, those contributions plus 10% of their wages and from 1 October, employers must pay 20% until the scheme ends at the end of the month.Crucially, If employers don't contribute - neither will the government. Cash-strapped employers must decide if they can take on an increasing burden to keep workers for whom there may be little or no work.The chancellor said the government couldn't go on meeting the full cost of the scheme.The hospitality industry has been particularly hard hit by the lockdown, and it will face further difficulties because of the need to maintain social distancing and potential future customer reticence to return when pubs and restaurants reopen.The chancellor resisted calls for special treatment of this or other hard-hit sectors. David Moore is a restaurateur who owns the Michelin-starred Pied a Terre, in London. He's worried the additional costs announced by the chancellor could mean jobs would be lost.""It would be a real shame if the retention scheme turned out to be a very, very glorified waiting room for the unemployed. And I feel that if we come back with any level of uncertainty - a lot of businesses will cut harder and further than maybe they thought of doing first""There was also an important announcement for self employed - who got a cash grant for March - June capped at £7,500. They will now get a maximum and final payment of £6,570 in August.The withdrawal is more gradual than many had feared and the government hopes that the support withdrawal will be mirrored by business demand recovering. But we may be about to find out how many real jobs are left in the post-coronavirus economy.",29 May 2020,business
Virus-hit self-employed to receive second payment,"Self-employed people whose work has been affected by coronavirus will receive a ""second and final"" grant in August, the government says.More than two million people have applied for a single grant of up to £7,500 so far.They, and other self-employed people, will be eligible for a second payment in August of up to £6,570, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced.It comes as details of the extended furlough scheme were also outlined.Until now, self-employed workers who qualify have been in line for a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to £2,500 a month for three months. This is being paid in one instalment.Some 2.3 million of these workers have signed up for grants totalling £6.8bn.Those whose work has been affected by coronavirus will still be able to apply for this lump sum until 13 July.At the government's daily press conference, Mr Sunak has now announced applications for a second taxable grant will open in August.This will be slightly less generous, covering 70% of the applicant's average monthly trading profits.It will also be made in a single payment, covering three months and capped at £2,190 a month, or £6,570 in total. Applicants will need to confirm their work has been affected by the virus, but they would not need to have taken the first grant to be eligible for the second.One of those eligible is musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam, who has seen work dry up since her show at the Royal Shakespeare Company was cancelled at the start of lockdown.She was worried that without more support she would not have known how she would feed herself, having paid many essential bills using savings, but she still worries about the long-term outlook if people are unable or slow to return to arts venues.""Another grant would make things more manageable in the immediate future, but hopefully it is not just a short-term plug,"" she said.""I hope this is the beginning of looking into the bigger problems for the arts.""The announcement comes after a cross-party group of 113 MPs signed a letter sent by Labour's Siobhain McDonagh to Mr Sunak calling for more support for the self-employed.It warned that failing to offer an extension would ""would pull the safety net from under the feet of millions of self-employed workers"".Mr Sunak also announced more details of how the furlough scheme for employees will be paid for in the coming months.That scheme has been extended until October.The Treasury says that there is not direct parity between the two schemes but, unlike furloughed workers, the self-employed could technically continue with some work while receiving support from the government. ""Our five million-strong self-employed community will be greatly relieved to know that the income cliff-edge they were facing in two days' time has now been removed,"" said Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses. ""The hope is that more and more sole traders will be able to return to work safely as restrictions are eased. Policymakers have rightly recognised that self-employed business owners working in a lot of sectors - not least hair and beauty, events and travel - will be massively impacted by the current downturn for many weeks to come.He added that more should now be done for those not receiving these payments.A number of self-employed people, such as directors who pay themselves in dividends and the newly self-employed, are unhappy at missing out on the government's self-employment support package.",29 May 2020,business

Kylie Jenner: Forbes drops celebrity from billionaire list,"Forbes magazine has struck reality TV star and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner from its list of billionaires, and accused her family of inflating the value of her cosmetics business.Forbes said the family went to ""unusual lengths"" to present its youngest member as richer than she was.In tweets, Jenner dismissed the article as ""inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol"".""I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there,"" she wrote.""I can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money I have,"" she added.The move reverses the status Forbes conferred on Jenner in 2019, when it declared her a self-made billionaire.The description sparked controversy, with critics scoffing at the ""self-made"" title and pointing to her upbringing as a Kardashian family reality TV star.Forbes, which is known for its widely cited billionaire rankings, credited Jenner's status to the success of her cosmetics company, which she founded in 2015 and which includes Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin.Jenner last year announced she was selling a 51% stake in the company to beauty giant Coty for $600m. Forbes said the family's accountant had provided it with tax returns that suggested the firm had done more than $300m in sales in 2016 and that publicists claimed sales of $330m the following year.But information shared by Coty, which is publicly traded, showed Jenner's firm is ""significantly smaller and less profitable than the family has spent years leading the cosmetics industry and media outlets, including Forbes, to believe"", Forbes said.Coty's presentation to investors about the business suggested the firm did only $125m in sales in 2018.""If Kylie Cosmetics did $125 million in sales in 2018, how could it have done $307 million in 2016 (as the company's supposed tax returns state) or $330 million in 2017?"" Forbes asked in the article.Despite the magazine's downgrade, Jenner is hardly hurting.Forbes said she pocketed $340m from the sale of her business. It now estimates her net worth at ""just under $900m"".Forbes writers have previously accused other would-be billionaires of inflating their riches, including US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and President Donald Trump.",29 May 2020,business
"Rishi Sunak wants firms to pay more, but also survive","The Chancellor is attempting a delicate balancing act. Slowly withdrawing very expensive government support programmes without crashing the economy. The government is currently paying 80% of the wages of nearly 8.5 million employees and 80% of 2.3 million self employed worker's take home pay till the end of July at cost in the many tens of billions of pounds. As the economy emerges from lockdown that will change. From 1 July, employers will be able to bring in workers part-time and pay them for the time worked. That is a month early, has been widely called for and will be welcomed. Then the hard part starts. From August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension costs for furloughed workers. From September, those contributions plus 10% of their wages and from 1 October, employers must pay 20% until the scheme ends at the end of the month.Crucially, If employers don't contribute - neither will the government. Cash-strapped employers must decide if they can take on an increasing burden to keep workers for whom there may be little or no work.The chancellor said the government couldn't go on meeting the full cost of the scheme.The hospitality industry has been particularly hard hit by the lockdown, and it will face further difficulties because of the need to maintain social distancing and potential future customer reticence to return when pubs and restaurants reopen.The chancellor resisted calls for special treatment of this or other hard-hit sectors. David Moore is a restaurateur who owns the Michelin-starred Pied a Terre, in London. He's worried the additional costs announced by the chancellor could mean jobs would be lost.""It would be a real shame if the retention scheme turned out to be a very, very glorified waiting room for the unemployed. And I feel that if we come back with any level of uncertainty - a lot of businesses will cut harder and further than maybe they thought of doing first""There was also an important announcement for self employed - who got a cash grant for March - June capped at £7,500. They will now get a maximum and final payment of £6,570 in August.The withdrawal is more gradual than many had feared and the government hopes that the support withdrawal will be mirrored by business demand recovering. But we may be about to find out how many real jobs are left in the post-coronavirus economy.",29 May 2020,business
Virus-hit self-employed to receive second payment,"Self-employed people whose work has been affected by coronavirus will receive a ""second and final"" grant in August, the government says.More than two million people have applied for a single grant of up to £7,500 so far.They, and other self-employed people, will be eligible for a second payment in August of up to £6,570, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced.It comes as details of the extended furlough scheme were also outlined.Until now, self-employed workers who qualify have been in line for a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to £2,500 a month for three months. This is being paid in one instalment.Some 2.3 million of these workers have signed up for grants totalling £6.8bn.Those whose work has been affected by coronavirus will still be able to apply for this lump sum until 13 July.At the government's daily press conference, Mr Sunak has now announced applications for a second taxable grant will open in August.This will be slightly less generous, covering 70% of the applicant's average monthly trading profits.It will also be made in a single payment, covering three months and capped at £2,190 a month, or £6,570 in total. Applicants will need to confirm their work has been affected by the virus, but they would not need to have taken the first grant to be eligible for the second.One of those eligible is musical director Yshani Perinpanayagam, who has seen work dry up since her show at the Royal Shakespeare Company was cancelled at the start of lockdown.She was worried that without more support she would not have known how she would feed herself, having paid many essential bills using savings, but she still worries about the long-term outlook if people are unable or slow to return to arts venues.""Another grant would make things more manageable in the immediate future, but hopefully it is not just a short-term plug,"" she said.""I hope this is the beginning of looking into the bigger problems for the arts.""The announcement comes after a cross-party group of 113 MPs signed a letter sent by Labour's Siobhain McDonagh to Mr Sunak calling for more support for the self-employed.It warned that failing to offer an extension would ""would pull the safety net from under the feet of millions of self-employed workers"".Mr Sunak also announced more details of how the furlough scheme for employees will be paid for in the coming months.That scheme has been extended until October.The Treasury says that there is not direct parity between the two schemes but, unlike furloughed workers, the self-employed could technically continue with some work while receiving support from the government. ""Our five million-strong self-employed community will be greatly relieved to know that the income cliff-edge they were facing in two days' time has now been removed,"" said Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses. ""The hope is that more and more sole traders will be able to return to work safely as restrictions are eased. Policymakers have rightly recognised that self-employed business owners working in a lot of sectors - not least hair and beauty, events and travel - will be massively impacted by the current downturn for many weeks to come.He added that more should now be done for those not receiving these payments.A number of self-employed people, such as directors who pay themselves in dividends and the newly self-employed, are unhappy at missing out on the government's self-employment support package.",29 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: UK sees almost no car manufacturing in April,"British car manufacturing came to a screeching halt in April, down 99.7% against the same month last year. It was the lowest output since the Second World War, according to the industry body, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).Just 197 premium and luxury sports vehicles rolled off factory lines, with 45 of those sent to UK customers.  Instead, some plants refocused to make 711,495 items of personal protective equipment for health workers. “With the UK’s car plants mothballed in April, these figures aren’t surprising but they do highlight the tremendous challenge the industry faces, with revenues effectively slashed to zero last month,” said SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes. The loss of 400,000 cars that would normally have been made is expected to cost the British car industry up to £12.5bn in revenues. In April there were 830 new car engines made at UK plants, 781 of which were exported. This level was down 99.5% on the year before. Mr Hawes said ramping up the industry again would be a “gradual process”. Half of the UK’s engine and car makers are expected to head back to work this week. Production timescales will be staggered with strict social distancing measures in place. The SMMT has suggested to car manufacturers that factory workers should be provided with PPE. Nissan backs UK plant but protests erupt in SpainMcLaren to cut 1,200 jobs as virus hits demandCar manufacturers are also expected to work with fixed teams and with partnering to limit the number of people who interact on a daily basis. Before production mostly stopped, the few cars that were produced were luxury cars from brands like McLaren, Bentley and Rolls Royce.It takes about a month to assemble a high end luxury sports car. Although production of vehicle lines had stopped, the finishing touches were still being applied to 197 luxury cars that were sent to customers.With normal factory work on hold, the industry redirected its capability towards manufacturing PPE for healthcare workers. Face shields, visors and medical gowns were pieced together in car factories. Rolls Royce and McLaren were among the companies which helped to make medical equipment such as ventilators. Although the car industry is progressing with plans to resume production slowly, unions say a severely weakened industry needs urgent government help.Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary, said: ""We urgently need a sector plan to support the UK's world class auto industry through this crisis, with investment to defend jobs and support for a transition to electrification.""The French and German governments have wasted no time in getting behind their manufacturing workers.""He said that in both countries, governments are using the shutdown to intervene, with taxpayer support, in return for a transition to a greener domestic industry and support for their local supply chains.""The UK government needs to match this ambition, proudly talking up our manufacturing champions and working with unions to recover and meet the challenges of the future, sustaining and creating quality jobs and apprenticeships,"" he said.",29 May 2020,business
What if the US removes Hong Kong's special status?," Top members of the US administration have warned that Hong Kong no longer merits a special status when it comes to trade, and the territory could be treated the same way as mainland China. Until now, the US has given Hong Kong favourable trading terms, dating back to the territory's time as a British colony, but US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress that Hong Kong no longer enjoys a high degree of autonomy from China.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Beijing ""will be held accountable"" for a new security law set to be imposed on Hong Kong. The National Economic Council Director told CNBC, ""If need be, Hong Kong now may have to be treated the same way as China is treated, and that has implications for tariffs"". So what will it mean if that special status is revoked? Hong Kong is well-known as one of the world's most important financial centres. With a free economy and a competitive tax regime, it's attracted many multinational companies to its shores. It's also an important hub for trade. But all of that could be in jeopardy, if the US changes the way it deals with Hong Kong.So what is the US threatening? At the moment, Hong Kong enjoys special trade relations with the US. It operates as a separate customs territory to mainland China. It also has a free port, meaning no tariffs are charged on the import or export of goods. Those arrangements have helped Hong Kong become a centre for global trade. But now the US is threatening to treat Hong Kong the same as mainland China. That would mean its goods would be subject to additional tariffs, including those extra charges that were introduced as part of the US-China trade war, although some of those have recently been rolled back. ""Hong Kong has had a special trading relationship with different types of tariffs and regulations that have allowed it to trade in a freer way, particularly in relation to capital markets,"" said Dr Rebecca Harding, independent trade expert and CEO of Coriolis Technologies.""The US has treated it as an ally, if you like. But it's now saying we are going to treat you in a similar way to how we treat China,"" she said.Where does that leave Hong Kong?Hong Kong is one of the world's top trading territories. In 2018 it was ranked with the 7th highest volume of trade with a total value of nearly $1.2tn. But much of that trade is made up of goods that pass into, or come out of, mainland China. In 2018, 8% of mainland China's exports to the US and 6% of mainland China's imports from the US, passed through Hong Kong. This role as a gateway between the Chinese market and the rest of the world has put Hong Kong in a unique position, but different trade arrangements could change that. ""If there's a new trade regime in place, that changes the calculation for companies,"" said Dr Tim Summers, a Senior Fellow at Chatham House, based in Hong Kong. Companies could choose to move their goods directly through ports in mainland China instead, and higher tariffs there will mean higher price tags. ""The people who are going to get hurt are businesses and consumers,"" Dr Summers said.Will China be worried? Not so much as it might have been at the time of the Hong Kong handover. Back in 1997, Hong Kong played a much more significant role in China's economy, accounting for around 18% of China's GDP. ""But over the last 25 years China has grown massively,"" said Dr Summers. Hong Kong now contributes just 2-3% of China's GDP. ""Put that in context of the ocean of trade coming out of China, it's not so significant any more. So if President Trump were to act on trade, Hong Kong would suffer, but it's not a gamechanger for China,"" he said.Beijing will however want to maintain Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre. Mainland Chinese companies are among those which choose to list on Hong Kong's Stock Exchange because of its access to global capital. Mainland Chinese companies also benefit from Hong Kong's large financial services sector.""Shanghai and Shenzhen already have a vibrant financial services sector serving mainlanders,"" said David Webb, a former investment banker who's lived in Hong Kong since 1991. But so long as Beijing has capital controls on the movement of money in and out of China for investment, ""then it can't compete with Hong Kong on international capital,"" he said.How could this affect the US? Each year, billions of dollars worth of goods and services are traded between Hong Kong and the US. In 2018, the total value of that trade was almost $67bn according to the US Trade Representative, including $17bn worth of imports that Americans bought from Hong Kong. If Hong Kong faces the same trading terms as mainland China, US consumers will pay more for those goods. ""American businesses both in the US itself and in Hong Kong are lobbying hard to try and get any action diluted,"" said Rachel Cartland, director of Cartland Consulting and a former Hong Kong civil servant. The US Chamber of Commerce has warned that far-reaching changes to Hong Kong's status would have ""serious implications"" for Hong Kong and US businesses.That puts Washington in a tricky position, according Dr Summers. He says ostensibly, Secretary Pompeo's threat appears to be about recent developments in Hong Kong, and Beijing's new security law for the territory. But he said, what it's really about is US-China relations.""If I were going to be really cynical, I would say this has provided an opportunity for some people in Washington to take measures they wanted to take anyway against China, in the context of a wider US-China rivalry,"" he said. ""That may well drive the thinking of what Trump does next more than any particular concern about the political autonomy of Hong Kong,"" he said. ",28 May 2020,business
Will coronavirus change America's jobless stigma?,"More than 21 million people in the US - roughly one in six workers - are now receiving unemployment benefits amid the economic havoc triggered by the pandemic.The dramatic numbers, a sign of the steep job losses triggered by the virus lockdown, are not unique to the US. But they are prompting fierce debate in a country that has long attached stigma to state aid.Another 2.1 million people filed new jobless claims last week.That pushed the new applications made since mid-March above 40 million, the weekly Labor Department figures show.A further 1.2 million people applied for benefits through the federal government's coronavirus emergency relief, which expanded what kinds of workers are eligible for assistance.The scale of the crisis this spring created rare support among Americans for a broader safety net, said Victor Tan Chen, an assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University, who has studied attitudes toward unemployment in the US compared with other countries. But he warned that backing is already waning, despite the ongoing need.""This is a national and international crisis. People are understanding they have to do what they have to do to keep themselves and their families afloat, so it's diminished that stigma - at least for the time being,"" he said.""But you can already see that part of the culture rising up and it's going to get worse and worse as this situation drags out.""Economists - including the head of the America's central bank - have warned holding back further assistance may slow economic rebound, which remains uncertain, despite loosened restrictions across the US.But lawmakers are fighting over extending the emergency relief and whether a $600 across-the-board boost to the benefits - which can vary widely by state and worker - was too generous, noting that many low-wage workers are earning more on unemployment than they did on the job.Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said this week that he thought another round of economic relief was likely. But talks about the package are reportedly minimal and he rejected an aid proposal worth an estimated $3tn approved by the Democrat-controlled House.""The way that the recovery will be fast is, if people who have been out of work because of the virus have enough income so that when the economy does reopen they will be able to get out there and spend,"" said Heidi Shierholz,  a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, who was the top economist at the Labor Department during the Obama administration. The Labor Department's report on Thursday showed the number of new claims in the week ended 23 May continuing to subside since the peak at the end of March. For the first time, the number of Americans on state unemployment programmes also dropped back, falling to 21 million in the week ended 16 May from 25 million the week earlier.But the figures remain much higher than anything seen since the Great Depression, with the total number of people participating in all state and federal programmes at roughly 31 million as of 9 May. The US also said on Thursday that the economic contraction in the first three months of the year was 5%, worse than the 4.8% initially estimated.Many forecasters expect a rebound to begin this summer. But predictions by the Congressional Budget Office and others see the unemployment rate staying above 10% by the end of the year - roughly triple what it was in March and higher than the 10% peak during the financial crisis. On Wednesday, Boeing said more than 12,000 employees in the US will lose their jobs in coming weeks and American Airlines revealed plans to cut management and support staff by 30%, or about 5,000 jobs. ""We know things are still deteriorating,"" Ms Shierholz said. ""When we'll start to see some turnaround it's hard to know.""Emma Craig, who lost her jobs as a restaurant server and supper club singer when New York's stay-at-home orders went into effect in March, said government help has been critical.Without the $600 coronavirus bonus, Ms Craig said the benefits would barely cover her $1,200 monthly rent. With it, the 31-year-old says she is making ""just below"" what she earned in a bad week before the pandemic.""With the $600, I'm keeping my head above water,"" she said. ""If I was just getting unemployment it would be laughable.""The closures came just as Ms Craig felt like she was finally making it as a professional singer, a career she had been working toward for a decade.""It all came crashing in very quickly,"" she recalled. ""It was literally 24 hours - what is my career, what is the future?""Ms Craig said she had no qualms about seeking assistance and she is starting to feel more optimistic about the future since the unemployment benefits finally kicked in, some two months after she first applied. This week, offering another glimmer of hope, the supper club told her it planned to reopen though it has not set a date.""The light at the end of the tunnel just opened,"" she said.",28 May 2020,business
My Money: 'Our alternative quarantine holiday',"My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here Alyssa Hulme from Heber City in Utah, US, takes us through a week in her life during the coronavirus pandemic.Alyssa, 31, is a freelance writer and educational consultant. She and her husband Randy have four children: Ellie, eight, Max, seven, Amethyst, four and Josie, one. She has been homeschooling her children for a year, months before the pandemic started. She says her week started out mundane but ended up awesome! She had no idea on Monday where she would be by Sunday. Over to Alyssa....I started the day nursing my one-year-old, passed her off to her dad for breakfast and settled down for a solid 45 minutes of private time before spending the rest of the day homeschooling three kids and caring for a baby. After prayer, meditation, and setting my To-Dos for the day, I purchased a course, the 30-day Money Cure with Carol Tuttle for $297 (£242). The course is on gaining financial affluence by clearing out limiting belief systems that don't serve me and replacing them with healthy practices. I have been looking forward to this course for months and have set aside money for this specific purpose. After that I moved on to begin my day with my family and set everyone to their beginning tasks of piano, chores, and math. We've been homeschooling for a year now, so it's been a pretty typical day. But at lunchtime instead of transitioning to a play date, my husband took our eldest out for one-on-one time to help supplement the loss of activities and outings that has come with Covid-19 lockdowns. We've been isolating since the end of February and the loss of friends is wearing on us all. During our midday quiet time I taught two online vocal training lessons virtually to students who live in town. Typically they'd come to my home, but we are all still isolating. After that we settled into our evening routine: I made dinner, we ate together and then held our weekly ""family night"" - an evening of talent shows, games, treats and fun.Total spend: $297 (£242)I continued with the money course. I am starting up a homeschool consulting business and really want to get on the correct and mentally healthy track for the sake of my business. The course has helped me identify several limiting beliefs I can clear up to allow space for more growth. Then, as every weekday for months, we did homeschool, lunch and quiet time in the afternoon. During quiet time I had a virtual occupational therapy appointment for my one-year-old in order to evaluate her for possible gross motor delays. This is free through our state. Next I had a virtual appointment with my therapist. This costs $110 after insurance and is withdrawn from my Health Saving Account, an account we pay into monthly through my husband's pay check and is tax free. Therapy always really takes it out of me and today it was compounded by some new business issues I'm working through, so my husband picked up dinner from a fastfood Chinese restaurant for $40. It ended up being a lot of food and will last a good two and a half meals for the six of us. I took the evening to work more on my business and work on my personal goals. Normally I'd go out with friends or go to the gym, but everything is closed, so I get to save more money and get to know my bed a little better.Total spend: $150 (£122)Our big outing today was a trip up the canyon near our home. We spent two hours hiking in the woods, building fairy houses and crossing streams. Later in the evening I started making plans for next year's homeschool and bought some notebooks and stationery through Target.com. I really dislike online shopping, especially for something as personal as a notebook. As a writer, the size, weight and binding of a notebook really matters to me, so buying from an online shop is very disorienting. I also bought a summer dress through Target.com, something I can easily nurse in and hope to be able to wear out and about someday here soon when the quarantine is lifted. Our county just moved to a low-risk status, so hopefully my husband and I can start up our weekly date nights soon. Total spend: $110.52 (£90)Late last night my husband discovered that he will not be returning to work in his office until the end of 2020. We discussed buying a motorhome, living in it for the next six months, renting out our home, and working and doing homeschool on the go. This has been a dream of ours for 10 years, but it never worked out with our careers. Now is the time. Today we decided to rent an RV (recreational vehicle) - $1,160 for four nights - and start testing out different configurations and living quarters. We decided to head for Yellowstone National Park. Two of the four entrances are now open! I found an RV site and started packing up. I normally would have gone grocery shopping last night but our travel plans halted that. As a result we were out of food today, so I grabbed lunch from a local shop for $33.50 and dinner from a restaurant for $45. This is not a normal thing for us to just pick up and drop a ton of money on travel, but we have now been in isolation since the end of February and we are all so ready to have a new experience. This money is coming from the allotment my husband and I had set aside to celebrate our 10 year anniversary tomorrow, but all our kid-free-for-the-first-time-in-five-years international travel plans were squashed by the virus. This will be an interesting substitute. We parked the RV along our path to Yellowstone at a Walmart. Anyone can park there overnight for free, so it's a great backup to have in mind when travelling. Total spend: $1,238.50 (£1,005)Happy 10 year anniversary to my husband and me! We celebrate the day by first getting groceries from Walmart and starting the trek to Yellowstone. I bought groceries for the week for $233. Not too bad for a family of six with limited fridge and cupboard space. We stopped to fill up the RV with gas for $213. After several hours of driving, we arrived at the spot I had reserved online yesterday for two nights, a total of $180, including water and electricity plug-ins. It's a little high for an RV site, but it's the closest I could find to the park entrance online and we decided to value time in the park over the cost of the campsite. (All the sites inside the park are closed due to Covid-19.)Total spend: $626 (£510)More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series:We woke early and headed to the park today, but it was closed due to a snowstorm. The road ended up getting 12 inches of snow in some places! Instead of exploring the park we explored the National Forest just outside.Total spend: $0We got up early again and were able to enter the park! We used our National Parks Pass to get in, so no cost today. We did everything that was open in the park, the big attractions for us being the Upper and Lower falls outlooks, the Grand Prismatic Spring, and Old Faithful. We saw so much wildlife on this trip, far more than my husband or I even saw here as children. We drove by and hiked next to elk, bison, deer, egrets, and even several bears including a baby and mama bear. We attribute this expanse of wildlife to conservation efforts in the park as well as the closure of the park over the last several months. The snow also allowed us to see all the animal tracks throughout the park which our kids loved! Old Faithful had the largest crowd, but still very small even for this time of year. We watched with a small, social distancing crowd for the big event, and then headed out. We were tempted to get take-out from the lodge near Old Faithful, but decided to continue eating the food we'd already purchased knowing the lodge food prices are really marked up. We packed up and exited the park through the South Entrance and drove through Grand Tetons National Park and got gas in Jackson Hole for $176. Wyoming has lots of open land for free parking, but with a new vehicle and dark terrain, we decided to stay overnight in a National Forest campsite a half hour away for $15 for the night. We pulled in about 23:00, paid via cash in a drop box, and enjoyed sleeping next to a river and under a blanket of stars.Total spend: $191 (£156)Thanks for coming with me on my 10 year wedding anniversary trip! This is not the trip we'd planned, but it's been wonderful for our family. We've seen two more National Parks, taken a break from quarantine in a way that feels safe for us, and enjoyed our beautiful nation. This is an unusually high week for us because we went on our trip. But considering $2,000 of that was spent on our trip and only $613.02 spent on our normal life, I feel good about that. We had $2,000+ saved for months now to go to Barbados later this summer, but we have given up all international travel until the virus settles down. All in, I feel like this was a successful trip. We would not be moving forward with purchasing an RV had we not had the real life experience of travelling in one for an extended period of time. The remaining $613.02 also reflects an unusual cost in the money course I am taking. I haven't purchased class tuition in probably five years, but being home all the time has me under-stimulated and needing a project. I think like many families these days, our spending in many areas has decreased (no extracurriculars, less shopping and self-care purchases, almost no gas purchases), but in other ways expanded. I don't bring my kids into any grocery stores anymore, so when my husband is too busy at work to be with them and we run out of food, I get take-out meals. When our mental health is being run down by monotony, we rent RVs, buy our kids bikes, and online shop for anything to help the kids make it through the day. This is survival for us. I feel very privileged to be financially secure and have a very stable income. While the world is in chaos we will continue to use money as a tool to support our mental wellbeing and try to take advantage of the new opportunities opening up to us. We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on.

The little lights now packing a deadly punch,"""The tech we are working on could transform water sanitisation techniques and offer access to clean drinking water to even remote developing regions via portable systems,"" says Christian Zollner from the University of California in Santa Barbara. Mr Zollner has been working on light emitting diodes (LEDs), the long-lasting technology in modern lightbulbs. They are probably in the lightbulbs in your house, or the headlamps of your car.Because they are tough and energy efficient, researchers are always trying to find new ways of using them.Mr Zollner and his team have been working on LEDs that emit ultraviolet light, in particular UV-C light, which is deadly to bacteria and viruses, including the coronavirus.His goal is to make those LEDs more powerful, robust and cheaper. ""Right now, UV LEDs are capable of a few milliwatts of power. Our aim is to make them 10 to 20 times more powerful. ""Our focus previously was mainly on using them for water sterilisation, but the Covid-19 pandemic has made us realise there is also a big market for sanitising surfaces and equipment. If there is another virus situation in say five or 10 years, this technology could be very useful.""At the moment his lights are powerful enough to cleanse a closed cabinet, but need to be 20 times more powerful to zap a whole room.The light can also damage human skin and eyes, so the commercial applications are limited.But one firm has found a use. Californian firm LARQ makes what it says is the world's first self-cleaning water bottle.Its solution to prevent exposure to UV-C light is to ensure the tiny UV LEDs in the lids of its bottles only come on when the bottles are screwed shut.Users must then push down on the lid to activate the technology, which the company claims eradicates more or less all bacteria and viruses in 60 seconds.LEDs have come a long way since the first were produced in the 1960s.Back then, the only light the semiconductor devices could generate was an infrared light invisible to the human eye.Now, they cover the entire visible spectrum, as well as infrared and UV light and come in a dazzling array of forms.Micro-LEDs that measure less than 1mm across are another of the latest variants. Designed for use in high-end screens, micro-LEDs promise blacker blacks, brighter blues.Samsung has been showing off its massive screen made of micro-LEDs at consumer electronics shows.""Micro-LED display technology offers a huge improvement to standard LED panels due to its optimum brightness and image definition,"" says Damon Crowhurst, head of display at Samsung UK.But the engineering involved is mind-boggling. The screens need millions of micro-LEDs, which means they are expensive - a 75-inch TV costs tens of thousands of pounds.""Micro-LED screens cost about £1,000 per inch to make, so a 75-inch micro-LED television could easily cost the same as a new Porsche Cayenne,"" says Paul Gray, an analyst at global technology researcher Omdia.""You have to ask yourself how many people will be prepared to pay that to get better contrast when they watch TV.""The crushingly high cost of micro-LEDs is one reason a number of manufacturers currently prefer mini-LEDs, which though still tiny measure more than 1mm across.Apple, for example, is rumoured to be developing six new products with mini-LED displays, including both iPads and MacBooks.In the short term, small-screen devices such as smartwatches are expected to be the biggest growth area for micro-LEDs.""Small screens are a much easier proposition, as a 1cm micro-LED screen can be made on a single silicon chip,"" Mr Gray says.""They are already being used in camera viewfinders. So for products such as smartwatches, we are looking at a much shorter timeframe.""Researchers are finding ever more exotic ways to make the perfect LED - more light with less power.UK-based start-up Kubos Semiconductors is developing LEDs based on a form of Gallium Nitride (GaN) with a crystal structure that is cubic rather than hexagonal, an approach it believes could solve long-term problems creating more efficient micro-LEDs.At the moment, green and amber LEDs are up to three times less efficient than blue and red ones. Known as the Green Gap, the phenomenon reduces the performance and increases the cost of lighting and displays.""This will be very important in applications such as mobile phones and smartwatches where displays need to run off a battery,"" says Kubos chief executive Caroline O'Brien.More Technology of BusinessElsewhere, researchers are working to reduce LED production costs and environmental impact.An EU-funded study is experimenting with using naturally occurring fluorescent protein structures to create bio-LEDs. Based in Austria, Spain, and Italy, the multi-university project began in January and is due to run for four years.""The goal is to find a cheaper and more environmentally friendly way of producing LEDs by avoiding the need for inorganic phosphates that have to be mined in specific locations,"" says Gustav Oberdorfer, who is leading research at Graz University of Technology in Austria.""We hope our LEDs will be used commercially in devices within the next 10 years, and believe they could both lower the cost of LED devices and make them much more sustainable.""So next time you turn on a light, think of the humble LED, which has come a long way since the 1960s and has a bright future.",29 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: How the advertising industry is changing,"The first rule of advertising is that your adverts have to be seen to have any effect.This is why if you have managed to get out of the house recently in the UK you might have noticed that there are an awful lot of adverts supporting the National Health Service, and key workers on billboards and bus stops.As Anja Lambrecht, professor of marketing at the London Business School, explains, it is one of the signs that the advertising industry is struggling.""It is most obvious outdoors with billboards - no-one is driving past them, so no commercial firms are advertising,"" she says. ""That is why they all have adverts for the NHS.""On TV an ever-growing number of us are increasingly watching streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, which don't have any adverts. Meanwhile on traditional commercial TV channels, there are lots of advertising breaks with very few adverts in them.In the UK, ITV's advertising revenue was down 42% in April, while Fox in the US has seen revenues halve. It is a similar picture in other markets, because there are many products that are just not selling at the moment. So why advertise them?Take the car industry - sales in the UK in April fell 97%, and are at the lowest level since 1946. They also fell by almost 50% in the same month in the US.It may seem obvious therefore that car advertising is a waste of money. But cars are still being advertised - albeit to a lesser extent - on TV, on social media, and even on some billboards.That is because the advertising and marketing industries have long memories, and worry that their customers don't. Companies with brands that have been around for decades, and which are worth billions, don't let them die in a recession.""Brands are reminding people that they exist,"" says Andrew Stephen, L'Oréal professor of marketing at Oxford University's Saïd Business School. ""Research shows time and time again in a crisis that turning off advertising altogether slows down the recovery.""So some businesses will always maintain advertising, no matter how bad things get, as Prof Lambrecht explains. ""During the 2008 recession, Procter and Gamble and other similar companies kept their advertising constant. Firms try to stay in the consumer's mind, even if consumer spending falls. It pays to keep your brand in the consumer's eye.""In this respect, some companies are treating this pandemic as an economic shock like others they have been through in the past. But in other ways it is different. For a start, advertisers have to work out where to spend what money they do have.There has long been a move away from traditional outlets such as TV, radio and newspapers, as the advertising industry realised they were no longer reaching their target audiences. The money instead has been spent where audiences and especially young audiences go - online and especially on social media.But lockdowns also mean we are staying in and watching more TV, so which way should the industry jump? Matteo Montecchi, a fellow in marketing at King's Business School, seems fairly sure.""Using digital and social media to get information out there, especially to the younger generation, was already a trend before the pandemic,"" he says. ""This situation has just exacerbated that trend.""Which means that advertising executives are now working out where to spend their limited budgets online - not easy when the explosive growth in apps like TikTok means there are more and more places to spend what money they have. But there is one added bonus - it seems likely that older generations have used the lockdown to increase their use of the internet, and can therefore be targeted more effectively online.  The downside is that some industries that are very dependent on advertising income are in a real bind. Newspaper revenue, for example, is falling dramatically.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Not only have sales slumped, the Financial Times' print sales fell 39% in April, but advertising revenue has as well. Not least because many firms don't want to put their ads next to stories about the pandemic - rather difficult when that is the biggest story around.Mr Montecchi believes local press in particular is in a bad way. ""Local papers will really suffer and may not survive,"" he says.Finally, what of the advertising firms themselves? All those creative types who usually write catchy slogans, film the latest supermodel's makeup range, and sell multinational industry huge marketing campaigns that will reach every corner of the world.Now, like almost every other industry they have had to dramatically cut back, work from home, furlough staff, and put their plans on hold. It is pretty difficult to film ads at the moment, even if there is anyone out there willing to spend money on new ones.And that isn't going to end overnight, we are in the middle of one of the greatest economic shocks imaginable. And although firms want to keep their brands in the public eye, marketing and advertising budgets are going to take a hit for years to come. But for the ""creatives"" there is a longer-term worry: their business model has been to produce top quality advertising with the highest production values - exotic locations, famous names, brilliant film work, masterful special effects and seamless editing.The problem, says Oxford University's Prof Stephen, is that when you look at the audience's reaction to lower production values, ""research shows consumers don't really care, especially on digital channels"".To be blunt, if you can get the same result by spending less, why wouldn't you do that? This pandemic and lockdown will have dramatic effects on all aspects of marketing and advertising, from those dependent on its spending, like newspapers and TV channels, to the companies that make the adverts themselves. Not least because it has helped to accelerate the change from advertising in mainstream media to digital, which means the industry has had to react ever more quickly to a changing landscape in the middle of an economic catastrophe.

What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  We have lost 500 Billion Dollars a year, for many years, on Crazy Trade with China. NO MORE!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpOne of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Coronavirus: What help are self-employed getting from government?,"The self-employed are receiving government support to cover some of the losses they face as businesses struggle in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Ultimately, it may not be as generous as the scheme for furloughed workers, but it will now extend into the summer, following the latest announcement from Chancellor Rishi Sunak.If they have suffered a loss in income, a taxable grant is being paid to the self-employed or partnerships, worth 80% of their profits up to a cap of £2,500 per month. It is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, and is open to those who were trading in the last financial year, still trading now, and planning to continue doing so this year but who confirm business has been hit by coronavirus.Initially, this was for three months in one lump-sum payment.In August, applications will open for a ""second and final"" payment, the chancellor has said, which will cover 70% of profits, up to a cap of £2,190 a month for another three months, so £6,570 in total.This will again be made as a lump sum direct into bank accounts.More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment.The scheme has been open to those with a trading profit of less than £50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than £50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.Those who are recently self-employed, having set up since April 2019, will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because they will not have filed a tax return and therefore HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will not know of their self-employed status.Self-employed people can apply for the first grant until 13 July, and the second from August - at a date to be set. They do not need to have received the first to apply for the second.The government's help comes on top of a six-month delay for tax payments through the self-assessment system.Those with the lowest incomes are in line to receive more generous benefits payments, announced previously. The chancellor said those applying for universal credit should be paid within a few days.The chancellor said this will cover 95% of the self-employed who make most of their money from self-employment. This is how it works:Those who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are not covered by the scheme but will have 80% of their salary covered by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme if operating through PAYE.There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of £781 a month. The number has risen fast since the financial crash of a decade ago. About 3.8 million of them may be covered by this scheme.So far, 2.3 million self-employed have signed up to grants totalling £6.8bn.Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education.The chancellor also suggested tax breaks for the self-employed, such as lower national insurance may end in the future. These were in place because, for example, the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay, and to encourage entrepreneurship.This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of the self-employed with employees.A plan had already been announced for those who are employed.The government says 80% of gross wages in the private sector, up to £2,500 a month, for those not working and who would otherwise have been laid off will be covered by these grants from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).These was backdated to March and the scheme has been extended to October. The idea is to prevent mass unemployment.Employers will have to make a contribution to these payments from the summer.The self-employment support package is slightly less generous, but the Treasury says this is because, unlike salaried worker, self-employed people are still free to operate if work is available.",29 May 2020,business
Coronavirus: Hardship risk 'could undermine test and trace system',"Workers self-isolating under the new test and trace systems could be pushed into hardship, union warnings claim.The programmes, newly launched in England and Scotland, risked being ineffective unless these people were helped financially, the TUC said.Employees could be told to stay at home for 14 days on multiple occasions and face an income drop on sick pay.Those receiving £95 a week or even ineligible for statutory sick pay may feel forced to work, the TUC said.""That will put them, their workmates and their local community at risk, and undermine the entire test and trace programme,"" the union body's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said.Under the new systems, tracers will text, email or call people who test positive with coronavirus and ask who they have had contact with.Any of those contacts deemed at risk of infection will be told to isolate for 14 days, even if they are not sick and if they have already had the virus.While some employers will pay wages in full to those who are self-isolating, and some staff will request to take the time as their fully-paid holiday entitlement. some bosses will give people statutory sick pay of £95.85 a week. Guidance from the government says this should be paid from day one of isolation.Employers with fewer than 250 members of staff are now able to claim that cost back from the government, under a separate scheme launched earlier in the week.But some workers, often women working part-time, are ineligible for statutory sick pay as they do not earn an average of £120 a week, or are self-employed.They may have to fall back on the benefits system, or any self-employment support scheme, while off work.""The government must extend statutory sick pay to everyone - no matter what they're paid - and raise it to the level of the real Living Wage, £260 per week,"" Ms O'Grady said.""And the self-employed income support scheme must remain in place as a source of financial support for those forced to self-isolate.""The view was echoed by charity Citizens Advice, which said long-standing problems with statutory sick pay meant millions were ineligible or found the payment insufficient to cover essential costs.""People need enough to live on, so they can self-isolate if asked to without fear of being pushed into hardship,"" said Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice chief executive.There have been fears that people told to self-isolate, or who are shielding, could face pressure to return to work by unscrupulous employers.""We've already seen upsetting cases where vulnerable workers have faced the impossible choice of safeguarding their health or continuing to work because they have been denied furlough. We fear that those who need to self-isolate could face similar pressure,"" Ms Guy said.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was confident that the ""vast majority of people"" would participate in the voluntary system.""In this war on the virus, ultimately we are all on the same side and we've all got a part that we can play,"" he said.Northern Ireland has its own version of the test and trace programme already and the scheme in Wales is due to start in early June.",28 May 2020,business
