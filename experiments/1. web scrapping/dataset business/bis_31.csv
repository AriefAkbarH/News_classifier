Segway: End of the road for the much-hyped two-wheeler,"Segway is ending production of its original two-wheeler, which was popular with city tour guides and some police forces - but not the public.Launched in 2001, the much-hyped self-balancing vehicle promised to revolutionise personal transport.The Segway, invented by US engineer Dean Kamen, debuted with much fanfare, but struggled to make a profit.Accidents didn't help with the Segway's popularity, and the company was bought by Chinese rival Ninebot in 2015.Made at a factory in New Hampshire, in the US, production of the Segway Personal Transporter will end on 15 July.Announcing the news, Segway president Judy Cai said: ""Within its first decade, the Segway PT became a staple in security and law enforcement, viewed as an effective and efficient personal vehicle.""However, in the vehicle's almost two decade-long history it has also been the subject of mockery and high-profile collisions as well as a tragic death.In 2003, then-US President George W Bush took a tumble off a Segway at his parents' summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.The incident followed Vice President Dick Cheney's use of a Segway to ride around his office when his Achilles tendon was playing up.The Segway also served as a, quite literally, comedy vehicle in the 2009 Hollywood movie Paul Blart: Mall Cop.In the film, actor and comedian Kevin James played a security guard who patrolled a shopping mall on a Segway to much comic effect.In 2015, as he celebrated his fourth consecutive world 200 metres title, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt was knocked over by a cameraman on a Segway.No serious harm was done, and the legendary athlete quickly got to his feet and continued his victory lap.In January this year Segway's prototype wheelchair crashed during a demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) exhibition in Las Vegas.The S-Pod - a self-balancing electric wheelchair - was being tested by a journalist at the time. The rider had accelerated the vehicle before accidently crashing into a wall.The Segway was also at the centre of a tragic incident when the self-made millionaire owner of the company died after falling from a cliff in the UK while riding one of his firm's motorised scooters.Jimi Heselden crashed into the River Wharfe while using his Segway on his estate, in West Yorkshire, just 10 months after buying the firm in 2009.The inquest into Mr Heselden's death heard that he died due to an ""act of courtesy"" as he tried to make way for a dog walker.",24 June 2020,business
Rent day arrives for struggling retailers,"""We're almost 90% open with most of our retailers trading. It's a return to almost normality,"" says James Roberts the boss of Grosvenor Shopping centre in Northampton. But there's one big question.  How many of the 50 or so retailers and food outlets will be paying any rent this week. He laughs nervously when asked.""Hopefully some, but we've only collected 56% in the last quarter,"" he says. UK landlords should be collecting at least £2.5bn on Wednesday for shop rents.  Retail landlords traditionally get paid four times a year. On the last rent day in March, no more than half the total rent was handed over and landlords will be lucky to get a quarter of what they're owed today. Most high street shops, along with pubs and restaurants, have seen sales evaporate and have either been unable or refusing to pay rent. Businesses are hoarding cash to survive. But the crisis is starving landlords of much needed income, too. The Grosvenor Shopping Centre is the kind of everyday mall you'd find in many of our towns and city centres. It's owned by Legal & General which invests in property to fund thousands of pensions. ""It's not well known, or particularly transparent to people, but most retail properties are effectively owned by the normal person on the street in the UK,"" said Bill Hughes, Legal and General's head of real assets. Recent research by Estates Gazette, a commercial property weekly, showed that as much as 60% of all UK retail space is owned either directly or indirectly by the public, including pension funds, the public sector and individual shareholders.It's been a secure form of income until now. ""The risk of loss of income is really important. The pension fund owners of the built environment of the UK, they rely upon the income being produced by what hitherto have been seen as being very stable assets. And that is at risk in a way that's never been there to the extent before."" said Mr Hughes.  Landlords have enjoyed the good times over the decades with long leases and upward-only rent reviews.  And rapidly expanding retailers were happy to sign up. But in recent years with sales shifting online, it's become far harder for shops to make a profit. The pandemic has accelerated this trend.  The Government extended its ban on evictions for non-payment of rent until the autumn. Occupiers are now frantically trying to secure better deals or turning to insolvency proceedings to renegotiate their debts, including owed rent. The traditional business model of how retail property is leased is now well and truly broken. ""It's a mess, but it's not a mess that we can't tidy up"" said Mark Burlton, the founder of Cross Border Retail, a real estate business which advises landlords and retailers. ""I do feel sorry for them (landlords) . Absolutely. They are entitled to receive income, but I don't believe they're entitled to receive the same income as they were. I think they have to understand the value of their asset. And the value of their asset is what someone is prepared to pay for it. There isn't a queue of retailers coming up behind them,"" he said. He believes upward only rent reviews should be abolished along with the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1954, the law which still underpins the leasehold system in the UK.  ""It's inflexible. We need something which is much cheaper and quicker to negotiate. We should have a system of rents based on turnover, allowing retailers to pay a rent they can afford. But in order to do that, tenants have to play their part. They have to declare what they are turning over,"" said Mr Burlton.Bill Hughes thinks the Government's new code of practice on rental agreements should ease the tensions. ""We're having an active conversation with tenants about can they pay, and if they can't pay, we're working hard to restructure things.""Because it's in our interest to find a way of helping cash flow to companies that would survive beyond this very difficult, unusual crisis that Covid presents."" Legal & General's Bill Hughes thinks the Government should take a careful look at providing some financial support to help bridge the likely shortfall in income otherwise the ""dynamic between landlords and tenants is likely to be challenging and deteriorate"". The future prosperity of our high streets and town centres could ultimately be at stake if this crisis doesn't end well.  Regeneration requires private sector investment as well as Government funding. Mr Hughes says unless there's an appeal for long term investors like pension funds to invest in UK real estate, infrastructure won't get funded. ""They need a sensible and stable environment within which they can get some sort of return,"" he explains. Mr Burlton says he's receiving phone calls from US private equity and venture capitalists sniffing around for opportunities to snap up some retail assets on the cheap. ""Ultimately if landlords and tenants can't agree what the actual rent should be, then a number of landlords face the very real prospect of going bust. And then we have to be careful what we wish for because the purchasers of these assets in my opinion will likely have much shorter goals than the landlords they currently have. "" The fate of heavily indebted shopping centre owner, Intu, will be decided by Friday. It owns some of the UK's biggest and most popular malls, including the Trafford Centre and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. If it can't secure a last minute agreement with its lenders, it will go into administration which could mean the temporary closure of its sites. ",24 June 2020,business
Still closed - the shops not allowed to reopen,"While pubs and hairdressers in England have been given the all clear by government to reopen on 4 July, many business owners were disappointed to learn they must keep their doors closed for now. ""It was a shock. I can understand the logical argument but personally it feels very irritating and disappointing,"" says Adam Grant,  a tattoo artist and studio manager at Tattoo UK in Uxbridge, west London.He says it was frustrating to hear that hairdressers can open on 4 July, while tattoo parlours must remain closed.  It was especially irritating since tattoo parlours already have measures in place to prevent-cross contamination he says, such as the disposable gloves and aprons which artists must wear.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament on Tuesday that the government's public health experts will work with sectors which remain closed, to help them become ""Covid secure"" and open ""as soon as possible"".In the hope of a 4 July opening, Mr Grant had already made changes to the way the studio operated, including mandating face masks and asking future customers to come to appointments alone. Now he says he has no date for reopening and no guidance on what safety measures will need to be in place. ""We've been left in limbo really, until further notice,"" he says.As a self-employed tattoo artist Adam was able to claim financial support from the government during lockdown, but he says that only covered him for 2-3 months.  ""We may have to see if we can get another self-employment scheme because if we're not allowed to open, we need to be compensated,"" he says. The ten businesses still not allowed to reopen:Beautician Tara Williamson is also frustrated by what she sees as a double standard from government, with hairdressers allowed to reopen but beauty salons staying closed.She runs The Beauty, Skin and Eyelash Lounge in Epping and had planned to open on 4 July. ""I don't really get it. I don't see a reason why we couldn't open and it will obviously be a big blow,"" she says.Tara had already made a number of changes at the salon, following safety guidelines that were issued to salons reopening overseas, in the absence of any clear guidelines in the UK.""We've put screens in place, we've done a one-way system in the salon, we've prepared everything for the two metre distancing, we've staggered appointments, we've got sanitising stations,"" she says. ""It just seems crazy that we have no guidelines of when we can open and what is going to be happening.""Rob Ward, who runs YourGym, an independent fitness centre in Lytham, Lancashire, says he was also hoping to reopen on 4 July. The gym received a government grant of £25,000 during lockdown and Rob was able to enrol his staff on the state-paid furlough scheme. But he says closing for three months has inflicted a huge financial hit. ""You start a year with projected figures but they've all been knocked,"" he says.""We've had some amazing support from local members, who were able to support us financially even when they couldn't come in. ""A lot of our personal trainers taught free online classes to keep the gym going. It's been a crazy time but there are such positives that come out of it.""Rob had been putting in place social distancing measures for when the gym can welcome back its members.""Every other treadmill is out of order now, so you've got space. In our spin studio we've taken lots of bikes out,"" he saysHe's also used tape to ensure space between floor workout stations, bought a fogging machine for overnight disinfecting, and introduced a new online booking system. Even though the government has now reduced social distancing guidelines from 2m to '1m-plus', Rob says he'll keep the current measures in place ""to inspire consumer confidence"". ""We need a date. That's the main thing."" Mark Sesnan, managing director of GLL, says he'd also like a date to open his 200 swimming pools, with 11,000 staff across the UK.""Basically we've been surviving on fresh air for the last 13 weeks. We feel extremely disappointed and let down,"" he says.""As an industry we submitted documents to government on 7 May. Those documents have all been accepted and we'd been led to believe they provided a good enough framework for re-opening.""Mark says GLL was able to furlough most of its staff, but the organisation has also had to dig into its cash reserves. With pools geared toward a 4 July opening, GLL has also incurred costs from recent preparations such as water testing. He says the worst thing about Boris Johnson's announcement on Tuesday was the lack of a firm opening date for businesses that must remain closed. He's called on the government to ""come off the fence"". ""I was down at Charlton Lido yesterday in the blazing sunshine with a massive bright blue, empty swimming pool. It's sad for everybody,"" he says",24 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: 'We went from 30 customers to one in 18 hours',"Liam and Louise Parkinson's cleaning business was just a few weeks old when the coronavirus outbreak forced them to stop working. The husband-and-wife team based in Chippenham, Wiltshire, launched their company Abode and Beyond in January and soon began hiring extra staff to meet the demand from new clients.But then - as news of the coronavirus spread - business quickly dropped away. ""Within 18 hours we'd gone from 30 customers down to one or two,"" Liam says. When the country went into lockdown on 23 March, Liam and Louise had to tell their clients they were suspending all services.In early June, the couple began working again, but only a quarter of their previous clients have booked home cleaning.  ""Lots of people say now they can't afford to have a cleaner because they're struggling financially,"" Liam says.Other customers have told them cleaning would be too much of a disruption while they're working and educating children from home. And some clients are shielding or worried about the risk of catching Covid-19 from workers coming into their home. Those concerns mean cleaners all over the country are facing huge financial challenges, especially as those who work cash-in-hand aren't eligible for government support. Martyna, not her real name, works part-time as a domestic cleaner to supplement her main job as a housekeeper at a London hotel. She's been furloughed - or put on state-paid leave - by the hotel but is struggling to get by without the added income cleaning would normally provide.""For more than two months, I didn't do any cleaning work,"" she says. Now she's waiting for her clients to call. ""It's boring and also I need the extra money. The [furlough] money is only for the rent and food. It's nothing.""Cleaning staff are permitted to work in people's homes, but industry leaders say there hasn't been clear guidance from the government advising cleaners how to keep themselves and their clients safe. ""There's nothing that we can adhere to, we've just got to decide for ourselves what's appropriate, it's a huge worry,"" says Stephen Munton, director of the trade body the Domestic Cleaning Alliance.""We're reliant now on people telling us what they want us to do in their home, what they want us to wear. Should we be taking equipment in, because we don't know whether we should be using what's in the house?""The British Cleaning Council (BCC), which represents 20 trade groups across the cleaning industry, has written to the Small Business Minister Paul Scully, asking for a meeting to clarify some of those issues, but no such meeting has been arranged. The BCC says that's left cleaning businesses to come up with safety protocols for themselves. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy pointed to the government's general coronavirus guidelines for all people who work in private homes.""We have worked closely with businesses, unions and medical experts to develop practical guidelines specifically for those working in other people's homes. These are aimed at making workplaces as safe as possible and giving staff confidence to return to work,"" she said. ""We regularly review the science behind the guidance and will continue to work closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including the British Cleaning Council, as we continue to reopen the economy.""Chris Wootton runs the domestic cleaning business Poppies, which has 22 franchises across England and usually provides 6,000 cleaning services a month.  All 450 Poppies staff have been furloughed during the lockdown, but now each of the franchises is back up and running.""In simple terms, we've assumed that any of our clients or our staff may be pre-Covid or asymptomatic,"" he says. ""So we've protected one another by practising social distancing, providing gloves, shoe covers, masks and aprons for all our staff.""Chris has also introduced new protocols for when cleaning staff arrive at their clients' homes. Staff cannot hug or shake hands with their clients. They have also been instructed to wear a mask on arrival, then take two steps back after knocking on the door. ""We do our best to smile with our eyes. That very moment gives our clients confidence,"" he says. Chris, who also manages his own Poppies franchise, says older clients make up about a third of the domestic cleaning market. Barbara and Jim Jackson are in their 80s and are self-isolating because of the virus. They're among those who have put their regular cleaning service on hold. ""When we feel it's safe to have people come into the house, we will go back to a cleaner because they've been wonderful for us over the years,"" says Barbara. ""At the moment we have to share the chores between us."" Once the coronavirus is no longer a risk, Chris Wootton is optimistic he'll see an upturn in elderly customers. ""I think they will be a growth area for us because those people will want to stay longer in their own home and not go into a care home,"" he says. Meanwhile, back in Chippenham, Liam and Louise Parkinson are hoping more clients will soon start booking their cleaning service again. The couple have been living off their savings since March, since they chose not to apply for government support. ""We were a new company and we were really unsure whether we would qualify. We didn't think 10 weeks later we would still not be working,"" says Liam.""We have had literally zero income from that day so it has been really tough. We're between £5,000-£7,000 out of pocket in lost company earnings. It's pretty worrying. It's wiped out all of our personal savings.""",24 June 2020,business

Coronavirus: 'We went from 30 customers to one in 18 hours',"Liam and Louise Parkinson's cleaning business was just a few weeks old when the coronavirus outbreak forced them to stop working. The husband-and-wife team based in Chippenham, Wiltshire, launched their company Abode and Beyond in January and soon began hiring extra staff to meet the demand from new clients.But then - as news of the coronavirus spread - business quickly dropped away. ""Within 18 hours we'd gone from 30 customers down to one or two,"" Liam says. When the country went into lockdown on 23 March, Liam and Louise had to tell their clients they were suspending all services.In early June, the couple began working again, but only a quarter of their previous clients have booked home cleaning.  ""Lots of people say now they can't afford to have a cleaner because they're struggling financially,"" Liam says.Other customers have told them cleaning would be too much of a disruption while they're working and educating children from home. And some clients are shielding or worried about the risk of catching Covid-19 from workers coming into their home. Those concerns mean cleaners all over the country are facing huge financial challenges, especially as those who work cash-in-hand aren't eligible for government support. Martyna, not her real name, works part-time as a domestic cleaner to supplement her main job as a housekeeper at a London hotel. She's been furloughed - or put on state-paid leave - by the hotel but is struggling to get by without the added income cleaning would normally provide.""For more than two months, I didn't do any cleaning work,"" she says. Now she's waiting for her clients to call. ""It's boring and also I need the extra money. The [furlough] money is only for the rent and food. It's nothing.""Cleaning staff are permitted to work in people's homes, but industry leaders say there hasn't been clear guidance from the government advising cleaners how to keep themselves and their clients safe. ""There's nothing that we can adhere to, we've just got to decide for ourselves what's appropriate, it's a huge worry,"" says Stephen Munton, director of the trade body the Domestic Cleaning Alliance.""We're reliant now on people telling us what they want us to do in their home, what they want us to wear. Should we be taking equipment in, because we don't know whether we should be using what's in the house?""The British Cleaning Council (BCC), which represents 20 trade groups across the cleaning industry, has written to the Small Business Minister Paul Scully, asking for a meeting to clarify some of those issues, but no such meeting has been arranged. The BCC says that's left cleaning businesses to come up with safety protocols for themselves. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy pointed to the government's general coronavirus guidelines for all people who work in private homes.""We have worked closely with businesses, unions and medical experts to develop practical guidelines specifically for those working in other people's homes. These are aimed at making workplaces as safe as possible and giving staff confidence to return to work,"" she said. ""We regularly review the science behind the guidance and will continue to work closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including the British Cleaning Council, as we continue to reopen the economy.""Chris Wootton runs the domestic cleaning business Poppies, which has 22 franchises across England and usually provides 6,000 cleaning services a month.  All 450 Poppies staff have been furloughed during the lockdown, but now each of the franchises is back up and running.""In simple terms, we've assumed that any of our clients or our staff may be pre-Covid or asymptomatic,"" he says. ""So we've protected one another by practising social distancing, providing gloves, shoe covers, masks and aprons for all our staff.""Chris has also introduced new protocols for when cleaning staff arrive at their clients' homes. Staff cannot hug or shake hands with their clients. They have also been instructed to wear a mask on arrival, then take two steps back after knocking on the door. ""We do our best to smile with our eyes. That very moment gives our clients confidence,"" he says. Chris, who also manages his own Poppies franchise, says older clients make up about a third of the domestic cleaning market. Barbara and Jim Jackson are in their 80s and are self-isolating because of the virus. They're among those who have put their regular cleaning service on hold. ""When we feel it's safe to have people come into the house, we will go back to a cleaner because they've been wonderful for us over the years,"" says Barbara. ""At the moment we have to share the chores between us."" Once the coronavirus is no longer a risk, Chris Wootton is optimistic he'll see an upturn in elderly customers. ""I think they will be a growth area for us because those people will want to stay longer in their own home and not go into a care home,"" he says. Meanwhile, back in Chippenham, Liam and Louise Parkinson are hoping more clients will soon start booking their cleaning service again. The couple have been living off their savings since March, since they chose not to apply for government support. ""We were a new company and we were really unsure whether we would qualify. We didn't think 10 weeks later we would still not be working,"" says Liam.""We have had literally zero income from that day so it has been really tough. We're between £5,000-£7,000 out of pocket in lost company earnings. It's pretty worrying. It's wiped out all of our personal savings.""",24 June 2020,business
Segway: End of the road for the much-hyped two-wheeler,"Segway is ending production of its original two-wheeler, which was popular with city tour guides and some police forces - but not the public.Launched in 2001, the much-hyped self-balancing vehicle promised to revolutionise personal transport.The Segway, invented by US engineer Dean Kamen, debuted with much fanfare, but struggled to make a profit.Accidents didn't help with the Segway's popularity, and the company was bought by Chinese rival Ninebot in 2015.Made at a factory in New Hampshire, in the US, production of the Segway Personal Transporter will end on 15 July.Announcing the news, Segway president Judy Cai said: ""Within its first decade, the Segway PT became a staple in security and law enforcement, viewed as an effective and efficient personal vehicle.""However, in the vehicle's almost two decade-long history it has also been the subject of mockery and high-profile collisions as well as a tragic death.In 2003, then-US President George W Bush took a tumble off a Segway at his parents' summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.The incident followed Vice President Dick Cheney's use of a Segway to ride around his office when his Achilles tendon was playing up.The Segway also served as a, quite literally, comedy vehicle in the 2009 Hollywood movie Paul Blart: Mall Cop.In the film, actor and comedian Kevin James played a security guard who patrolled a shopping mall on a Segway to much comic effect.In 2015, as he celebrated his fourth consecutive world 200 metres title, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt was knocked over by a cameraman on a Segway.No serious harm was done, and the legendary athlete quickly got to his feet and continued his victory lap.In January this year Segway's prototype wheelchair crashed during a demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) exhibition in Las Vegas.The S-Pod - a self-balancing electric wheelchair - was being tested by a journalist at the time. The rider had accelerated the vehicle before accidently crashing into a wall.The Segway was also at the centre of a tragic incident when the self-made millionaire owner of the company died after falling from a cliff in the UK while riding one of his firm's motorised scooters.Jimi Heselden crashed into the River Wharfe while using his Segway on his estate, in West Yorkshire, just 10 months after buying the firm in 2009.The inquest into Mr Heselden's death heard that he died due to an ""act of courtesy"" as he tried to make way for a dog walker.",24 June 2020,business
Rent day arrives for struggling retailers,"""We're almost 90% open with most of our retailers trading. It's a return to almost normality,"" says James Roberts the boss of Grosvenor Shopping centre in Northampton. But there's one big question.  How many of the 50 or so retailers and food outlets will be paying any rent this week. He laughs nervously when asked.""Hopefully some, but we've only collected 56% in the last quarter,"" he says. UK landlords should be collecting at least £2.5bn on Wednesday for shop rents.  Retail landlords traditionally get paid four times a year. On the last rent day in March, no more than half the total rent was handed over and landlords will be lucky to get a quarter of what they're owed today. Most high street shops, along with pubs and restaurants, have seen sales evaporate and have either been unable or refusing to pay rent. Businesses are hoarding cash to survive. But the crisis is starving landlords of much needed income, too. The Grosvenor Shopping Centre is the kind of everyday mall you'd find in many of our towns and city centres. It's owned by Legal & General which invests in property to fund thousands of pensions. ""It's not well known, or particularly transparent to people, but most retail properties are effectively owned by the normal person on the street in the UK,"" said Bill Hughes, Legal and General's head of real assets. Recent research by Estates Gazette, a commercial property weekly, showed that as much as 60% of all UK retail space is owned either directly or indirectly by the public, including pension funds, the public sector and individual shareholders.It's been a secure form of income until now. ""The risk of loss of income is really important. The pension fund owners of the built environment of the UK, they rely upon the income being produced by what hitherto have been seen as being very stable assets. And that is at risk in a way that's never been there to the extent before."" said Mr Hughes.  Landlords have enjoyed the good times over the decades with long leases and upward-only rent reviews.  And rapidly expanding retailers were happy to sign up. But in recent years with sales shifting online, it's become far harder for shops to make a profit. The pandemic has accelerated this trend.  The Government extended its ban on evictions for non-payment of rent until the autumn. Occupiers are now frantically trying to secure better deals or turning to insolvency proceedings to renegotiate their debts, including owed rent. The traditional business model of how retail property is leased is now well and truly broken. ""It's a mess, but it's not a mess that we can't tidy up"" said Mark Burlton, the founder of Cross Border Retail, a real estate business which advises landlords and retailers. ""I do feel sorry for them (landlords) . Absolutely. They are entitled to receive income, but I don't believe they're entitled to receive the same income as they were. I think they have to understand the value of their asset. And the value of their asset is what someone is prepared to pay for it. There isn't a queue of retailers coming up behind them,"" he said. He believes upward only rent reviews should be abolished along with the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1954, the law which still underpins the leasehold system in the UK.  ""It's inflexible. We need something which is much cheaper and quicker to negotiate. We should have a system of rents based on turnover, allowing retailers to pay a rent they can afford. But in order to do that, tenants have to play their part. They have to declare what they are turning over,"" said Mr Burlton.Bill Hughes thinks the Government's new code of practice on rental agreements should ease the tensions. ""We're having an active conversation with tenants about can they pay, and if they can't pay, we're working hard to restructure things.""Because it's in our interest to find a way of helping cash flow to companies that would survive beyond this very difficult, unusual crisis that Covid presents."" Legal & General's Bill Hughes thinks the Government should take a careful look at providing some financial support to help bridge the likely shortfall in income otherwise the ""dynamic between landlords and tenants is likely to be challenging and deteriorate"". The future prosperity of our high streets and town centres could ultimately be at stake if this crisis doesn't end well.  Regeneration requires private sector investment as well as Government funding. Mr Hughes says unless there's an appeal for long term investors like pension funds to invest in UK real estate, infrastructure won't get funded. ""They need a sensible and stable environment within which they can get some sort of return,"" he explains. Mr Burlton says he's receiving phone calls from US private equity and venture capitalists sniffing around for opportunities to snap up some retail assets on the cheap. ""Ultimately if landlords and tenants can't agree what the actual rent should be, then a number of landlords face the very real prospect of going bust. And then we have to be careful what we wish for because the purchasers of these assets in my opinion will likely have much shorter goals than the landlords they currently have. "" The fate of heavily indebted shopping centre owner, Intu, will be decided by Friday. It owns some of the UK's biggest and most popular malls, including the Trafford Centre and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. If it can't secure a last minute agreement with its lenders, it will go into administration which could mean the temporary closure of its sites. ",24 June 2020,business
Still closed - the shops not allowed to reopen,"While pubs and hairdressers in England have been given the all clear by government to reopen on 4 July, many business owners were disappointed to learn they must keep their doors closed for now. ""It was a shock. I can understand the logical argument but personally it feels very irritating and disappointing,"" says Adam Grant,  a tattoo artist and studio manager at Tattoo UK in Uxbridge, west London.He says it was frustrating to hear that hairdressers can open on 4 July, while tattoo parlours must remain closed.  It was especially irritating since tattoo parlours already have measures in place to prevent-cross contamination he says, such as the disposable gloves and aprons which artists must wear.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament on Tuesday that the government's public health experts will work with sectors which remain closed, to help them become ""Covid secure"" and open ""as soon as possible"".In the hope of a 4 July opening, Mr Grant had already made changes to the way the studio operated, including mandating face masks and asking future customers to come to appointments alone. Now he says he has no date for reopening and no guidance on what safety measures will need to be in place. ""We've been left in limbo really, until further notice,"" he says.As a self-employed tattoo artist Adam was able to claim financial support from the government during lockdown, but he says that only covered him for 2-3 months.

Coronavirus: Go Outdoors calls in administrators,"Go Outdoors' owner has called in administrators for the business as the effects of coronavirus piles pressure on High Street retailers.JD Sports, which owns Go Outdoors, said the Covid-19 lockdown had brought into ""sharper focus"" the costs of the business, especially its lease terms.After appointing administrators, JD Sports then bought back the firm.The chain employs about 2,400 staff across 67 stores, specialising in camping equipment, bikes and clothes.After appointing Deloitte as administrators, JD Sports paid £56.5m for Go Outdoors in what is known as a pre-pack administration.The restructuring, which will also be led by Deloitte, will primarily focus on trying to renegotiate rent terms with landlords.""The terms of the property leases in Go were extremely inflexible, with the stores having an average remaining period to lease expiry of approximately 10 years with upwards only rent reviews, many of which are fixed at rates above inflation regardless of the market rent in the location,"" the firm said.JD Sports will continue to pay rent on Go Outdoor properties while the terms are being renegotiated.How many jobs and store locations are kept will in part depend on how those negotiations turn out, it said.""Subject to realism and flexibility in the future leases, it is the group's intention to retain the majority of Go's retail estate and preserve as many jobs as possible,"" it said.JD Sports will pay Go's debts to stock suppliers and its tax liabilities, and it will honour customer returns and gift cards. All of Go's employees will transfer across to the new company on the same terms and conditions.The Manchester-based JD Sports group bought Go Outdoors in 2016 for £112m. But the chain has been struggling in recent years, and forced store closures under the coronavirus lockdown have further exacerbated the firm's problems.While non-essential retailers have since been allowed to reopen in Northern Ireland and England, analysts have questioned how comfortable customers will feel returning to the shops.Compared with the same period in 2019, footfall was down 45.3% on the first day of reopening in England, according to retail analyst firm Springboard.Several big brands have been struggling due to the lockdown measures introduced in March to stop the spread of Covid-19.Cath Kidston, Laura Ashley and the UK arm of Victoria's Secret have all called in administrators.Last week, Poundstretcher announced that it has launched a company voluntary arrangement, an insolvency process that allows companies to continue trading while pushing through store closures and rent cuts.",23 June 2020,business
Wirecard: Former boss arrested over €1.9bn scandal,"The ex-boss of scandal-hit payments firm Wirecard has been arrested in Germany.Markus Braun resigned last Friday after auditor EY refused to sign off the firm's 2019 accounts over a missing €1.9bn (£1.7bn).The money accounts for about a quarter of the firm's total balance sheet.Prosecutors accuse Mr Braun of inflating Wirecard's finances to make it appear healthier to investors and customers.Mr Braun reported himself to Munich prosecutors on Monday evening after a judge issued an arrest warrant against the 50-year old.The missing €1.9bn was supposedly held in accounts at two Asian banks and had been set aside for ""risk management"", Wirecard had said.But EY said after an audit of the business that banks had been unable to provide the account numbers for where the money was held.On Monday, Wirecard admitted the €1.9bn simply may not exist.The German company also said it was withdrawing its financial results for 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.""The management board of Wirecard assesses on the basis of further examination that there is a prevailing likelihood that the bank trust account balances in the amount of 1.9 billion EUR do not exist,"" the company said in a statement.Mr Braun had been in charge of the German fin-tech firm since 2002. When Wirecard joined Germany's blue-chip Dax 30 share index two years ago it was valued at €24bn.

H-1B among visas hit by Trump's new foreign worker freeze,"US President Donald Trump has extended a pause on some green cards and suspended visas for other foreign workers until the end of 2020.High-skilled tech workers, non-agricultural seasonal helpers, au pairs and top executives will be affected.The White House said the move will create jobs for Americans hurting economically due to the pandemic.But critics say the White House is exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to tighten up immigration laws.In a briefing for reporters, the administration said the freeze, in place through the end of the year, would impact about 525,000 people. That includes an estimated 170,000 people blocked by the decision to extend a ban on some new green cards - which grants permanent residence to foreigners. The White House first announced it was halting those visas in April, an order that had been set to expire on Monday. Existing visa holders are not expected to be affected under the new restrictions announced on Monday.The order also applies to H-1B visas, many of which are granted to Indian tech workers. Critics say these visas have allowed Silicon Valley companies to outsource American jobs to lower-paid foreign employees. Last year, there were about 225,000 applications competing for 85,000 spots available through the H1-B visa programme. The order will suspend mostH-2B visas for seasonal workers, including those in the hospitality industry, except those in agriculture, the food processing industry and healthcare professionals.The order will restrict J-1 short-term exchange visas, a category that includes university students and foreign au pairs who provide childcare. Professors and scholars are not included in the order. There will be a provision to request exemptions. L visas for managers and other key employees of multinational corporations will also be suspended.Tech firms were among the groups condemning the president's action.Facebook said the order ""uses the Covid-19 pandemic as justification for limiting immigration"" and warned: ""In reality, the move to keep highly skilled talent out of the US will make our country's recovery even more difficult"".On Twitter, Apple boss Tim Cook wrote that he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the new proclamation, while Sundar Pichai, head of Alphabet - the parent company of Google and YouTube - said immigration was critical to the success of his company and the country.Immigration has contributed immensely to America’s economic success, making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today.

Deeply disappointed by this proclamation.End of Twitter post  by @tim_cookAmazon, which received more than 3,000 H-1B visas last year - more than any other firm - called the order ""short-sighted"".The Chamber of Commerce, a broader business lobby group, also panned the president's order, while some Canadian business leaders used the moment to tout opportunities outside the US.""If this affects your plans, consider coming to Canada instead,"" Tobi Lutke, chief executive of Shopify, wrote on Twitter.Tech companies have been at odds with the president over immigration since his first days in office, clashing with him over travel bans, as well as his crackdown on immigrants brought to the US illegally as children.But the president, who is up for re-election in November, has made his tough stance on immigration a touchstone of his campaign. He has said the jobs at tech companies should go to Americans.",23 June 2020,business
Lawsuit alleges defeat devices in Nissan petrol cars,"Up to 1.4 million Renault and Nissan vehicles sold in Britain could be equipped with illegal defeat devices, according to a lawsuit being launched today.They include a petrol-powered version of one of the UK's best-selling family cars, the Nissan Qashqai.The law firm behind the case, Harcus Parker, claims that some cars produced up to 15 times the legal level of nitrogen oxides when used on the road.Both companies deny the claims.Harcus Parker says it has seen independent test data which suggests that 1.3 million diesel cars built by Nissan and its French partner Renault may have been fitted with defeat devices. These are systems which turn emissions controls on when the vehicle is being tested, but switches them off when it is being used on the road - in order to improve their performance, reliability or both.But it also claims that up to 100,000 petrol powered cars may have been affected as well. These are Nissan Qashqais fitted with a 1.2 litre engine. Emissions from diesel vehicles have come under heavy scrutiny since 2015, following a major scandal involving the German giant Volkswagen.Volkswagen has paid out more than €30bn (£27bn) in fines, compensation and buyback schemes as a result. It is continuing to fight a number of consumer lawsuits, including one in the UK involving some 90,000 car owners. Petrol cars, however, generally produce lower quantities of nitrogen oxides (NOx) than diesels, and have not previously been shown to have been involved in emissions cheating - although there have been some claims to the contrary.Harcus Parker claims that the 1.2l Qashqai produces many times the legal level of NOx when used in real world driving conditions. It says that tests carried out by the Department for Transport (DfT) in 2017 confirmed that this was the case. The DfT subsequently asked Nissan if it could modify the design to reduce emissions - but this never happened.""For the first time, we have seen evidence that car manufacturers may be cheating emissions tests of petrol, as well as diesel vehicles"", says Damon Parker, senior partner at the law firm.""The data suggests to me these vehicles much like some VWs and Mercedes cars, know when they are being tested - and are on their best behaviour then and only then"".Harcus Parker claims this means customers overpaid for their vehicles, and should be entitled to some £5,000 each in compensation.""All Groupe Renault vehicles are, and always have been, type-approved in accordance with the laws and regulations for all the countries in which they are sold and are not fitted with 'defeat devices'"", Renault said in a statement.Nissan said the following in response to the planned lawsuit:""Nissan strongly refutes these claims. Nissan has not and does not employ defeat devices in any of the cars that we make, and all Nissan vehicles fully comply with applicable emissions legislation.""Nissan said the 2017 report showed variances for most brands involved. and that it said that the Nissan vehicle tested complied ""with all required regulatory limits.""Emissions Analytics, an independent firm which specialises in emissions testing carried out in 'real world' conditions, agrees that the petrol Qashqai does produce very high levels of NOx.""We tested this same engine some time ago"", says founder Nick Molden.""We found it produced about 16 times more NOx in real world conditions than the official level"".Nissan, however, insists that ""emissions standards have evolved since 2017, and we have introduced a new range of powertrains to meet them"".",23 June 2020,business
Creating an online course 'changed my life',"Like many others, interior stylist Lucy Gough saw her income disappear when the coronavirus hit and naturally felt anxious about her future prospects.""Within one week the four shoots I'd been prepping for were all cancelled,"" she recalls.However, rather than do nothing, London-based Ms Gough decided to pivot her business and create an online interior styling course after teaching a similar course at London design school Central Saint Martins.""Even though I'd wanted to create a course for the last year it wasn't until lockdown was confirmed and all my income evaporated that I started creating it,"" she says.Covering six modules including shoot styling and home staging, Ms Gough launched the self-paced course in mid-May and within two weeks had already attracted 112 students from as far as Canada and Poland. She estimates that the course might make her £20,000 this year.""It has changed my life in terms of giving me an income when all my jobs as a stylist were cancelled at the beginning of Covid-19,"" she says. ""I always envisaged my online course being a career sideline but at the moment it's my only focus. When shoots are scheduled in again it will start to become the passive income that I had imagined.""Ms Gough is just one of thousands of people worldwide to have created an online course following the outbreak of coronavirus. Thanks to the pandemic, e-learning platforms are experiencing an unprecedented demand as lockdown has prompted people to take courses on everything from digital marketing and life coaching, to floristry and gaming.Even before the coronavirus crisis, the value of the sector was forecast to jump to $300bn (£250bn) by 2025, up from $190bn in 2018, according to the research firm Global Market Insights.Ankur Nagpal, founder and chief executive of New York-based course-hosting platform Teachable, says lockdown has greatly accelerated the number of people starting an e-learning business.""A lot of people who intended to move their courses online in the future found this to be a catalyst and adapted rapidly,"" he says.Total revenue earned by course tutors on its platform has also grown significantly since the outbreak, with its teachers set to earn more than $43m in May, up from $24m in February.Even Mr Nagpal was surprised to see the surge in new course sales. ""I imagined there would be some form of consumer spending slowdown, but we saw the opposite.""Greg Smith, founder of Vancouver-based Thinkific, which provides the software for entrepreneurs looking to create online courses, says, ""Consumption has gone up as people are stuck at home and want to learn new professional skills or take up new hobbies to entertain themselves.""The company is seeing demand for courses in areas such as mental health, home school activities for kids, and health and fitness.  However, it is not all rosy in the world of online courses.Jonathan Little, 26, a content outreach executive living in Crewe, enrolled in a 14-day free trial of a graphic design course via Shaw Academy, an online learning platform, in May in a bid to improve his skillset.However, not happy with the course, he decided to cancel within the two-week period. He says the process was ""incredibly convoluted and damn-near impossible to cancel"".""You have to log into your account and then you go through five to six different screens, each one giving you the same spiel about 'don't give in on dreams'. ""After all these pages you finally get through to what you think is the cancellation page then you're told you can't cancel online and instead need to call. I rang from a landline and after a lengthy automated voicemail, I cancelled. After seeing reviews online I decided to call my bank to make sure no money would go out to them.""More Technology of BusinessMr Little says it has made him think twice about signing up to online courses in the future. ""It's made me a bit more cautious. I always usually look at reviews online but I just did it in the spur of the moment. It's made me cautious about signing up to things I've not heard of before.""James Egan, chief executive of Shaw Academy, told the BBC that Mr Little encountered an automated voicemail service because he called on a Sunday, when the firm does not have people answering the phones.""We apologise that the customer's cancellation process took longer than usual. We take customer feedback and satisfaction very seriously and are currently reviewing our cancellation process to see whether we can make it easier for the small number of people who choose to cancel our services.""How do other sites handle complaints about courses? Thinkific's Greg Smith says, ""If someone alerts us to a scam or fraud we will shut down sites. However, we have done that very little since we set up eight years ago.""Amanda Rosewarne, co-founder and chief executive of the CPD Standards Office, which provides independent Continuing Professional Development (CPD) accreditation, says people should be cautious when taking up courses due to an increasing number of scams.""One scam involves creating a site, charging you for a course, and then never delivering the product,"" she says. ""Scammers can also easily hook you by selling a course, but then once you have completed it and 'passed' the assessment, the professional certificate or licence fails to materialise in the post or by email.""Despite some problems in the sector, for some, running an online course can be life-changing.Leila Gharani, 42, has been teaching Excel courses costing via Udemy since 2016 and takes home a six-figure salary from the e-learning platform. The lockdown has led to three times as many students as usual taking up her courses, with 10,400 bookings in April.The Vienna-based course creator says teaching online has changed her ""whole life"". She adds: ""I stopped consulting and I switched all my work to online except for some conferences and speaking engagements. My husband left his full-time work and joined my company. We have a lot more time for the kids and it's offered more stability in our private life as we can work from home.""For those who never want to go back to an office, online courses might be the future.",23 June 2020,business
"'I'm feeling really anxious about reopening', says B&B owner","This year, 4 July will hold a different kind of celebration as a range of hospitality and similar firms in England are finally allowed to reopen for business.But with government guidance still not clear, how prepared are they?The BBC spoke to a pub, a salon and a B&B to find out how ready they are for the next phase of lockdown easing.""I'm feeling really anxious about reopening as I just don't know what's coming.""Lindsey Holland runs the Cleeve Hill Hotel, a 12-bedroom B&B in Gloucestershire.She runs the business on her own and worries that reopening rules may make that impossible.""I'm going to be really interested to see how much I'm going to be allowed to achieve by myself, when I have to switch from cooking to cleaning, for instance.""Many B&B staples will disappear, not least the buffet breakfast.""I've heard that breakfasts may have to be delivered to rooms, which isn't practical for me as a one-person business.""I also can't afford to buy room service trays.""Free magazines and the help-yourself minibar will also have to go.Lindsey reckons she will be able to open up three quarters of the hotel now the social distancing rule has been lowered from 2m to 1m. At 2m, she would only have been able to run at 50% capacity. However, she says if bookings don't pick up then it may not be worth her while opening the doors at all in July.""4 July is just two weeks away and we're only now getting bits of pieces of details of what the rules may be.""Even if I do reopen and we have enough bookings, a second wave could mean the end for us.""""We've spent a lot of time during lockdown getting ready for the new normal.""Simon Daws has run the Gloucester Old Spot pub in Cheltenham for a decade, but recent times have been his biggest challenge, he says.""We've been waiting for news of when we can reopen with different dates being bandied around, which hasn't been helpful.""He says he would have preferred more than a couple of weeks of notice to get the right beer in and get staff back from furlough, but he is still eager to get people back into the pub.The pub industry is desperate to reopen and cutting the social distancing rules to 1m will have a major impact, he says.""If the distance is 1m then pubs with generous garden areas can make a go of it,"" he says.His pub has room for 160 people outside but they've had to change things to prepare for reopening.""We don't need plastic screens as people won't come into the pub.

We are relying on sunny weather to make the new system work.""He is also worried about rumours that customers will have to book a table and supply the names of everyone on the table.""It's just putting more hurdles in our way, which is not good news for an industry that's on its knees.""Jo Dyer runs Plymouth hairdressing salon Yoke with husband Steve, and will be able to reopen on 4 July. But the last few weeks have been nerve wracking. ""The guidelines keep changing so we don't know yet what we need to do to open safely - or what kind of protective equipment will be necessary.""The salon plans to reopen with half of its eight stations to ensure clients remain a safe distance from each other.Opening hours will be extended to cover 08:00-20:00 every day except for Sunday to accommodate as many customers as possible, even with half as many stations and stylists available.Meanwhile clients will only have contact with one person, with stylists washing hair instead of apprentices.Now the reopening date has been confirmed, Jo hopes to start booking in appointments - although those wanting hair colouring will have to book in for a skin test first.They are waiting to find out what protective equipment they will need.""We don't know what grade facemasks we've got to have or what kind of gloves we need, given we're washing our hands constantly in normal times.""We have some cloth facemasks but they may not fit in with the guidelines."" Staff and customer safety will be paramount, she says, which means throwaway gowns instead of their normal eco-wear.""It goes against our ethical principles, but we're going to have to compromise to stay within the rules, it seems,"" Jo says.Will your business be reopening on 4 July?

"'I used to hate road cycling, now I design biking gear'","The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Remi Clermont, co-founder and co-owner of cycling clothing company Cafe du Cycliste.When Remi Clermont was a teenager, he was embarrassed that his father liked going road cycling.By road cycling, he means riding around on the type of bike you see in the Tour de France - ""drop handlebars"" that sweep downwards, and thin tyres.Despite Remi being born and raised in the Alsace region of eastern France, and road biking being one of the country's most popular sports, his young self just didn't like it.""My friends and I, all the kids, were into mountain biking at the time (the early 1990s),"" says the 44-year-old. ""Road biking was seen as very boring. I was almost ashamed when I told friends that my dad was into it.""Little did teenage Remi know, he would go on to catch the Lycra and tarmac cycling bug himself in his 20s. And then, at the age of 33, launch what is today one of the fastest-growing road cycling clothing companies - Cafe du Cycliste.Founded in 2009, in Nice on the French Riviera, the firm says it now sells €4m (£3.6m; $4.5m) worth of jerseys, shorts and other clothing items per year, with 50% year-on-year growth.""You can certainly say I changed my mind,"" jokes Remi.However, before we return to cycling, we need to go to the world of competitive kayaking. Remi took up kayaking when he was nine, and went on to be a member of the French national team for six years in his 20s.""My speciality was white water kayaking,"" he says. ""Sadly the discipline is not an Olympic sport, so I never got to go to one of them, but it was great to represent France in international competitions.""And it was the reason I got into road biking. Because you couldn't kayak in the winter when it was too cold, I'd cycle to keep my fitness up.""Then when he retired from the water sport at the age of 28, he kept up the cycling. As he was not paid for his kayaking, Remi had also needed to hold down a full-time job in his 20s. After getting a business degree from the École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris, he worked in the sporting corporate hospitality sector. This included working at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.A year later he got a job in the marketing department of the European arm of a US IT firm.""I wasn't a great fit for the role as I knew nothing about IT,"" says Remi. ""But it had one massive thing going for it - it was based in Nice, which really is cycling paradise. The hills behind Nice [which lead up to the Alps] are just wonderful.""Remi was soon spending weekends cycling with a workmate called Andre Stewart. Then Andre quit to buy and run a cafe in a small village to the north west of Nice, naming it Cafe du Cycliste.More The Boss features:Two year later, in 2009, Remi also left the IT firm to join his friend at the cafe business. His plan was to design and launch a range of upmarket road cycling clothes that they could sell to all the riders who stopped for a drink and a bite to eat.Specifically, Remi wanted to produce the cycling jerseys that he says you couldn't buy in France at the time - plain and understated ones that wouldn't look out of place in a posh menswear store. ""The only cycling jerseys you could buy at the time in France were racing ones with big logos and sponsors, that made you look as if you were competing in the Tour de France,"" he says. ""I wanted to produce something completely different.""There was a catch, however, in that Remi had no knowledge of or experience in the clothing sector. But undeterred, he says he set to work.""I started to learn everything I could,"" he says. ""I had some friends in Paris who were working in clothing and fashion, so I got some tips and helpful mentoring from them.""And I started going to all the trade shows, and asking millions of questions, and contacting plenty of factories in Italy.""A few months later, a manufacturer in Italy agreed to make Remi's first design for a cycling jersey, and the fashion side of Cafe du Cycliste was up and running.Sales from the shop were stubbornly slow, however, so Remi launched a website to target online customers, especially from overseas. With little to no money for advertising, he would send free samples to cycling journalists in various countries.They would then write enthusiastic reviews, and sales quickly took off, particular in the UK and Japan. ""Cyclists in the UK and Japan were really open to what we are doing,"" says Remi. ""And that remains the case, still only 10 to 15% of our sales are in France. Many cyclists here still want to look as if they are taking part in a race all the time.""British cycling journalist and commentator Rebecca Charlton says that brands like Cafe du Cycliste and the UK's Rapha, Le Col and Assos have led the way over the past decade in offering upmarket, stylish cycling clothing. This has coincided with a big increase in the number of people taking up the sport, leading to booming sales at the firms.""The trends, cuts and designs of modern cycling kit are a far cry from the extremely limited options I had as a young girl,"" she says.""And the psychology isn't to be underestimated either - when you've got a new cycling outfit you feel that bit more motivated to get out of the door, and you feel good. When it flatters, and fits perfectly, the ride feels more comfortable, and it definitely adds morale.""Back at Cafe du Cycliste's head office in Nice, Remi says that recent sales have mirrored the industry-wide increase as a result of coronavirus, with more people taking up cycling either to get some exercise or avoid public transport.His dad is also a fan of the clothing, which Remi continues to design himself, and is manufactured in a number of European  factories. However, his father initially wasn't impressed back in 2009.""When I first started out, he wouldn't wear it, because it was too different to the race jerseys he was used to,"" says Remi.",22 June 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Coronavirus: Swissport set to halve its UK workforce,"Swissport is set to cut more than half of its UK workforce as air companies struggle with the effects of the coronavirus crisis.It is consulting on cutting up to 4,556 jobs, the GMB union said.Chief executive Jason Holt said the company had to reduce the size of its workforce to survive.Swissport operates at airports across the UK, including Heathrow and Gatwick, which are among those badly hit by the crisis.Air travel collapsed around the world after governments imposed travel restrictions during coronavirus lockdowns.While some airlines are making plans to start flying some routes again as lockdowns lift, Swissport has said its revenue is forecast to be almost 50% lower than last year due to the crisis.Mr Holt said in a message to staff: ""We must do this to secure the lifeline of funding from lenders and investors to protect as many jobs as possible in the UK and Ireland.""It's true that we've seen tough times before - volcanic cloud, 9/11, the financial crisis - and we've weathered these. But this time it's different. We have never seen anything like Covid-19 in our lifetimes.""We are now facing a long period of uncertainty and reduced flight numbers, along with significant changes taking place to the way people travel and the way goods move around the world. ""There is no escaping the fact that the industry is now smaller than it was, and it will remain so for some time to come.""Swissport employs about 8,500 workers at airports, including baggage handlers and check-in staff.The GMB union said the announcement was ""devastating news"", with jobs set to be lost that were essential for regional economies.Nadine Houghton, national officer of the GMB, said: ""With Swissport now considering job cuts on this scale we have deep concerns about the viability of many of our regional airports and the benefits for regional connectivity that they bring.""Oliver Richardson, national officer of Unite, said: ""We can't wait any longer, the UK government needs to urgently intervene with a bespoke financial package and an extension of the 80% furlough scheme for the aviation industry.""The Department for Transport has consistently said that while the aviation sector is important to the UK economy, all firms, including aviation companies, should first explore existing government schemes and try to raise capital from investors before the government will consider the situation of individual firms.",24 June 2020,business
Demand soars for Naked Wines and home cooking ingredients,"Demand for Naked Wines and Premier Foods home cooking ingredients soared during lockdown, the firms have said.The online wine seller said revenue surged 81% in April and May, after many shops were forced to shut on 28 March.Naked Wines temporarily halted new orders last month after a huge jump in business as customers stockpiled.Mr Kipling-owner Premier Foods saw a 20% sales rise in the run-up to lockdown, with strong demand for cooking products continuing afterwards.Shoppers began to stock up on alcohol in April to drink at home as the coronavirus pandemic spread. Food stockpiling began in March, when the shelves of some shops were cleared.In a statement, Naked Wines said: ""We entered the new financial year with good momentum as Covid-19 has influenced customer shopping behaviour and driven increased demand for the Naked Wines offer.""The company stopped short of providing guidance for the rest of the year's trading due to the possibility of a consumer downturn in the second half of the year and ongoing uncertainties about the economy due to the pandemic.In a separate announcement Naked Wines, best known as the online business developed by Majestic Wine before the chain was sold last year, said its current finance chief James Crawford will leave the position to be appointed as the managing director of Naked Wines' UK business.Meanwhile, Premier Foods said demand for its pre-made Lloyd Grossman pasta sauces, Bisto and Oxo gravy, and Sharwoods curry condiments had soared.""One of the most prevalent trends we have seen during the lockdown is that Britain has got cooking again, with particularly high levels of demand for items relating to meal preparation, including cooking sauces, gravy and baking ingredients,"" chief executive Alex Whitehouse said.Its biggest brand, Mr Kipling, achieved its highest ever annual sales - but that was before the lockdown. During the crisis, cake sales were flat, a spokesman said.",24 June 2020,business
Still closed - the shops not allowed to reopen,"While pubs and hairdressers in England have been given the all clear by government to reopen on 4 July, many business owners were disappointed to learn they must keep their doors closed for now. ""It was a shock. I can understand the logical argument but personally it feels very irritating and disappointing,"" says Adam Grant,  a tattoo artist and studio manager at Tattoo UK in Uxbridge, west London.He says it was frustrating to hear that hairdressers can open on 4 July, while tattoo parlours must remain closed.  It was especially irritating since tattoo parlours already have measures in place to prevent-cross contamination he says, such as the disposable gloves and aprons which artists must wear.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament on Tuesday that the government's public health experts will work with sectors which remain closed, to help them become ""Covid secure"" and open ""as soon as possible"".In the hope of a 4 July opening, Mr Grant had already made changes to the way the studio operated, including mandating face masks and asking future customers to come to appointments alone. Now he says he has no date for reopening and no guidance on what safety measures will need to be in place. ""We've been left in limbo really, until further notice,"" he says.As a self-employed tattoo artist Adam was able to claim financial support from the government during lockdown, but he says that only covered him for 2-3 months.  ""We may have to see if we can get another self-employment scheme because if we're not allowed to open, we need to be compensated,"" he says. The ten businesses still not allowed to reopen:Beautician Tara Williamson is also frustrated by what she sees as a double standard from government, with hairdressers allowed to reopen but beauty salons staying closed.She runs The Beauty, Skin and Eyelash Lounge in Epping and had planned to open on 4 July. ""I don't really get it. I don't see a reason why we couldn't open and it will obviously be a big blow,"" she says.Tara had already made a number of changes at the salon, following safety guidelines that were issued to salons reopening overseas, in the absence of any clear guidelines in the UK.""We've put screens in place, we've done a one-way system in the salon, we've prepared everything for the two metre distancing, we've staggered appointments, we've got sanitising stations,"" she says. ""It just seems crazy that we have no guidelines of when we can open and what is going to be happening.""Rob Ward, who runs YourGym, an independent fitness centre in Lytham, Lancashire, says he was also hoping to reopen on 4 July. The gym received a government grant of £25,000 during lockdown and Rob was able to enrol his staff on the state-paid furlough scheme. But he says closing for three months has inflicted a huge financial hit. ""You start a year with projected figures but they've all been knocked,"" he says.""We've had some amazing support from local members, who were able to support us financially even when they couldn't come in. ""A lot of our personal trainers taught free online classes to keep the gym going. It's been a crazy time but there are such positives that come out of it.""Rob had been putting in place social distancing measures for when the gym can welcome back its members.""Every other treadmill is out of order now, so you've got space. In our spin studio we've taken lots of bikes out,"" he saysHe's also used tape to ensure space between floor workout stations, bought a fogging machine for overnight disinfecting, and introduced a new online booking system. Even though the government has now reduced social distancing guidelines from 2m to '1m-plus', Rob says he'll keep the current measures in place ""to inspire consumer confidence"". ""We need a date. That's the main thing."" Mark Sesnan, managing director of GLL, says he'd also like a date to open his 200 swimming pools, with 11,000 staff across the UK.""Basically we've been surviving on fresh air for the last 13 weeks. We feel extremely disappointed and let down,"" he says.""As an industry we submitted documents to government on 7 May. Those documents have all been accepted and we'd been led to believe they provided a good enough framework for re-opening.""Mark says GLL was able to furlough most of its staff, but the organisation has also had to dig into its cash reserves. With pools geared toward a 4 July opening, GLL has also incurred costs from recent preparations such as water testing. He says the worst thing about Boris Johnson's announcement on Tuesday was the lack of a firm opening date for businesses that must remain closed. He's called on the government to ""come off the fence"". ""I was down at Charlton Lido yesterday in the blazing sunshine with a massive bright blue, empty swimming pool. It's sad for everybody,"" he says",24 June 2020,business
