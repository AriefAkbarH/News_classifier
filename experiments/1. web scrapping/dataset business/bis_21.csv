UK to start post-Brexit trade talks with Japan,"The UK and Japan are set to begin talks on Tuesday aimed at reaching agreement on a post-Brexit trade deal.The negotiations come as London and Tokyo work towards replacing the agreement Britain currently has with Japan through the European Union.Without a new deal by 1 January 2021 the two countries will default to World Trade Organization trading terms.That would mean tariffs and obstacles to commerce between the UK and its fourth-largest non-EU trading partner.After decades of sharing its trade policy with the European Union, Britain is now embarking on free trade negotiations with countries around the world.Last month the UK launched formal talks with the United States and is also hoping to reach a trade agreement with the EU by the end of this year.Discussions with Brussels have proved to be particularly difficult, with no agreement so far on even the basic structure of what will be negotiated.Discussions with Japan will initially be held via video link and be between the UK's International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs  Toshimitsu Motegi.Ms Truss said that she hopes to build on the existing pact between Tokyo and Brussels: ""We aim to strike a comprehensive free trade agreement that goes further than the deal previously agreed with the EU, setting ambitious standards in areas such as digital trade and services.""""This deal will provide more opportunities for businesses and individuals across every region and nation of the UK and help boost our economies following the unprecedented economic challenges posed by coronavirus,"" Ms Truss added.According to British government figures, trade between the two countries totalled £31.4bn last year, with 9,500 UK-based businesses exporting goods to Japan.The UK hopes that a free trade agreement with Japan will help it to eventually join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).Membership of the 11-member CPTPP, a trade agreement that stretches from Australia to Chile, would significantly improve access for UK businesses to markets across the Asia-Pacific region.",9 June 2020,business
UK post-Brexit drug stockpiles at risk amid virus,"The UK has been warned by the pharmaceutical industry that some stockpiles of medical supplies have been ""used up entirely"" by the virus.A memo seen by the BBC advises the government to buy and store ""critical"" medicines to treat the virus.Drug makers fear stockpiles cannot feasibly be built back up again in time, if the UK should fail to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU.The government said ""robust contingency plans are in place"".The spokesperson added: ""We want a relationship with the EU which is based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals and centred on free trade.""However, firms fear disruption to global supply chains will seriously impact the NHS.The internal pharmaceutical industry memo, which was prepared for the government in May, warns that after the pandemic ends, there will be ""less or zero product available in the market to allow for stockpiling a broad range of products"" than there was in 2019, when stockpiling occurred in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit. At the time, the industry itself paid for six weeks' worth of stockpiles.""Preparations for the end of the transition period must complement plans to secure the supply of coronavirus therapeutic and supportive products,"" the memo says.The pandemic has led to a massive increase in demand for medicines not previously stockpiled for critical care and respiratory medicines, such as inhalers.At the same time, coronavirus lockdown measures imposed by governments have caused significant supply bottlenecks due to factory closures and export bans, as well as a drastic decline in air freight.The memo was put together by a cross section of pharmaceutical industry groups anticipating preparations for a failure to strike a trade deal with the EU, alongside a refusal to extend the negotiating period. If this happens, the UK would trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, which would mean trade barriers from the start of next year.The memo goes on to remind the government that the flow of medicines has been kept going through the pandemic thanks to ""international coordination and information sharing within global companies to ramp up, and where necessary, redirect manufacturing"". As a result, the pharmaceutical industry writes: ""We would warn against any drastic policies mandating wholesale changes to global supply chains, as this could fundamentally disrupt the supply of medicines for the NHS and patients in other countries.""The pharmaceutical industry has long anticipated that a no-deal Brexit could cause congestion at the ports of Dover and Calais, which is the route that 90% of imported drugs and medicines from the EU take to get to the UK.As a result, the industry has advised that the government itself will have to buy and store a longer list of ""critical products"" where ""supply could be challenging due to either COVID-19 or the end of the [Brexit] transition period"". The need for trading stability is even more important this year, because the pattern of demand for medicines is likely to be very different to normal. That means, the memo says, that the government needs to develop a new broader list of critical products which ""reflect the challenges posed by both the end of the transition period and continues response"" to the coronavirus crisis.The memo also emphasises that the government needs to be storing a much broader list of medicines going forward, because of the joint challenge of the pandemic and in the event of a no-deal Brexit deal at the end of this year.But the pharmaceutical industry says that to have significant impact, the stockpiling will have to start in the next few weeks, and even after the pandemic ends, stockpiling will not be possible for every medicine required. In a normal year, Christmas would be ""the worst time of year to ask companies to increase their stockpile levels"", the memo says.The pharmaceutical industry is expecting the system of no-deal government-chartered freight ferries and aeroplanes to be re-established, given that border disruption is expected at the end of the Brexit transition period. It says the government needs to signal that this will be the case by next month. And it has requested ""urgent clarity"" on the implementation of arrangements for Irish Sea trade, under the Northern Ireland Protocol.The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), one of the organisations involved in drafting the report, says firms had ""worked around the clock"" during the pandemic to make sure medicine supply chains held up.""With this pressure likely to continue over the coming months, the pandemic has reinforced why it is essential that the UK and EU reach a deal on their future relationship,"" said ABPI's chief executive Dr Richard Torbett.In the meantime, he said its members would continue to work closely with government to put detailed plans in place. ""But not everything is in the gift of industry. Stockpiling is one element - having alternative supply routes and making sure that goods can continue to flow uninterrupted across borders is also critical,"" he stressed. ",8 June 2020,business
Nissan: UK factory still under threat from no-deal Brexit,"The UK's largest car manufacturing plant is ""unsustainable"" if the UK leaves the European Union without a trade deal, owner Nissan says.The Japanese company's global chief operating head told the BBC people had to understand the EU was the Sunderland factory's biggest customer.Ashwani Gupta said that Nissan's commitment could not be maintained if there was not tariff-free EU access.Nissan has invested billions of pounds in the plant, which has 7,000 workers.His comments come despite the Sunderland site surviving this week's announcement on the Japanese giant's global restructuring programme.  Mr Gupta said: ""You know we are the number one carmaker in the UK and we want to continue. We are committed. Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it's not our intention but the business will not be sustainable. That's what everybody has to understand.""He also said that any plans for its strategic partner and 43%-shareholder Renault to take up spare capacity at Sunderland would be a matter for the French carmaker. The French government has a 15% stake in Renault.This is not the first time that Nissan has pleaded with UK and EU negotiators to ensure that the 70% of cars manufactured at Sunderland which are sold in the EU can avoid tariffs of 10% under World Trade Organisation rules - the legal default position if a deal is not struck.Those talks resumed this week, with the differences between the UK and EU being described on all sides as deep and wide.Last week, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU would consider a two-year Brexit delay, which was rebuffed by his UK counterpart David Frost, who told MPs the government's policy remains not to extend the transition period beyond the end of the year.Under an agreement signed last year, the UK has until the end of this month to decide whether it wants to request such an extension so the coming weeks are crucial.The comments by Nissan may dampen hopes raised just last week when the company said that while it was closing plants in Spain and Indonesia, it remained committed to Sunderland.An announcement by Nissan that Renault might take the European lead in the companies' global manufacturing alliance (which also includes Mitsubishi) by taking up an estimated 20% spare capacity at Sunderland were quashed for the foreseeable future by Renault last week, when it said it had no current plans to move in to the UK.Mr Gupta confirmed that any decision by its partners would be a matter for them, and that no such deal had been agreed. ""When it comes to the allocation of manufacturing, each company will take the decision based on the competitiveness of the plants.""Nissan is a huge fan of the Sunderland plant and paid tribute to the efficiency and hard work of the operation. But it reiterated that was not enough to secure its long-term future if tariffs were imposed in a market which it described last week as ""non-core"". It only has a 3% market share of the vehicle market in Europe.On a more encouraging note, Mr Gupta said recent sales figures from China showed the world's biggest car market was recovering fast and the company was winning market share. But vehicles for that market are not produced in the UK. It is still possible that Renault could decide to move production of certain vehicles to Sunderland. But it is hard to see how a company which is 15%-owned by the French taxpayer could find a way to make that work where Nissan, which has been in Sunderland for 40 years, says it cannot.Nissan's comments are a timely reminder that for many key industries, the Brexit issue - which has not been silenced by coronavirus news - has in many ways been amplified by it.

Pandemic pushes US into official recession,"The economic downturn in the US triggered by the pandemic has been officially declared a recession.The National Bureau of Economic Research made the designation on Tuesday, citing the scale and severity of the current contraction.It said activity and employment hit a ""clear"" and ""well-defined"" peak in February, before falling.The ruling puts a formal end to what had been more than a decade of economic expansion - the longest in US history.Meanwhile, US markets continued their rebound on Monday, as investors remained optimistic that the downturn will be short-lived.A recession was expected after the US economy contracted 5% in the first three months of the year. Employers also reported cutting roughly 22 million jobs in March and April, as restrictions on activity intended to help control the virus forced many businesses to close.Some economists are hopeful that the job losses have now stopped, and a rebound has begun. In May, US employers added 2.5 million jobs, as states started reopening.The National Bureau of Economic Research,  a private research organisation, said it viewed the scale of the decline that started in February as more significant than its duration.""The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,"" it said.The bureau typically defines a recession as an economic contraction that lasts ""more than a few months"".It has declared 12 recessions since 1948, the longest of which was the Great Recession, which lasted 18 months, from December 2007 to June 2009.US financial markets, which tumbled in February amid signs of the economic collapse, have been on the upswing since March, due to investor hopes that economic damage will be limited, thanks to emergency relief from Congress and the central bank.On Monday, the Nasdaq index closed at 9,924.7, gaining 1.1% to top its pre-pandemic record.The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to close at 3.232.3 - returning to where it started the year - while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.7% to 27,572.4. The two indexes are now less than 10% lower than their pre-pandemic peaks.US President Donald Trump has celebrated the rebound.""Big day for Stock Market. Smart money, and the World, know that we are heading in the right direction. Jobs are coming back FAST. Next year will be our greatest ever,"" he wrote on Twitter on Monday morning.Big day for Stock Market. Smart money, and the World, know that we are heading in the right direction.

Samsung: Court rejects Lee Jae-yong arrest warrant request,"A court in Seoul has denied an arrest warrant request for Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong, after prosecutors accused him of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.The ruling provides at least temporary relief for the de facto head of the South Korean conglomerate.But Mr Lee isn't completely in the clear yet as prosecutors said they will continue with their investigation.They can still return with new evidence and seek another arrest warrant.Last week state prosecutors asked the court to issue an arrest warrant against Mr Lee related to their probe into accounting fraud and the controversial merger of two Samsung businesses, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, in 2015. Prosecutors said the deal helped his plan to take greater control of the group.On Friday Samsung denied the allegation of stock-manipulation against Mr Lee, saying it was ""beyond common sense"" to claim he was involved in the decision-making.In another statement over the weekend, the group said the lengthy probe is weighing on management, which is in ""crisis"" at a time when the coronavirus pandemic and US-China trade war are adding to uncertainty.Three top executives, including a vice president, have already been given prison sentences for hiding or destroying evidence in the probe.The 51-year-old, also known as Jay Y Lee, is the son of Lee Kun-hee, chairman of Samsung Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate. He is also the grandson of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul.With a degree from South Korea's top university and an MBA from one of Japan's most prestigious universities, he has been groomed to take over the family firm.He became a Samsung president in 2009 and in 2013 was made vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics, the division which makes devices including smartphones, televisions, cameras and hard drives.Since Mr Lee's father suffered a heart attack in 2014, he has been considered the de facto boss of the entire Samsung group of businesses.According to Forbes magazine, the divorced father-of-two has a net worth of around $6.6bn (£5.2bn).In February 2017, Lee Jae-yong was arrested and then charged over his alleged role in a political and corporate scandal linked to South Korea's then president, Park Geun-hye.Charges against Mr Lee included bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and perjury.Samsung was accused of paying 43bn won ($35.7m; £28.1m) to two non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Ms Park, in exchange for political support.More specifically, the favours were alleged to include backing for a controversial Samsung merger which paved the way for Mr Lee to become the head of the conglomerate, a deal that needed support from South Korea's government-run national pension fund.Mr Lee denied the charges. He admitted making donations but said Samsung did not want anything in return. In August 2017 a court convicted him of the charges and sent him to prison for five years.Six months later that sentence was halved, and the Seoul High Court decided to suspend the jail term, meaning he was free to go.",9 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Mulberry plans to axe a quarter of its workforce,"Mulberry says it plans to cut 25% of its worldwide workforce, the vast majority of which work in the UK. The high-end fashion brand, which is best known for its leather goods, employs 1,400 people, including 1,140 in the UK. The company said in a statement it would start reopening UK stores from 15 June. But it said social distancing measures and reduced tourist and footfall levels would continue to affect its income.Mulberry was founded in Somerset in 1971, where its two factories are still in production. As well as luggage and handbags - some of which carry a price tag of more than £1,000 - it also makes footwear, jewellery and eyewear.Thierry Andretta, Mulberry's chief executive, said the temporary closure of its physical stores would continue to have a marked effect on business.Mulberry said it had been able to re-open stores in China and South Korea and, more recently, some stores in Europe and Canada.

"Coronavirus: New UK travel quarantine rules a stunt, says Ryanair boss","New rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days have come into effect.Those arriving by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - must give an address where they will self-isolate. Rule breakers will be fined.Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the laws were designed ""to prevent a second wave"" of coronavirus.But the boss of Ryanair has said the rules are a ""political stunt"" and are not a quarantine.Michael O'Leary told the BBC: ""You could be in Sainsbury's, you could be on the beach, you could be on the golf course in the unlikely event the Home Office calls you - all they will have is a mobile number.""He claimed even the Home Office acknowledged the rules were unenforceable.  Some industries have warned they will be severely impacted by the rules, and Mr O'Leary warned of devastation. Despite criticism from businesses, Ms Patel has said the measures are ""proportionate"" and being implemented ""at the right time"".For more on the rules click here.Almost all travellers have to fill in a ""public health passenger locator"" form on arrival. Failure to do so could lead to a penalty of £100, or travellers may be refused entry. If they are unable to provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. It says there will also be checks to see whether the rules are being followed.One airline passenger who was flying out to Germany from Stansted for work but lives in the UK, said he may have to stay overseas for longer because of the 14-day quarantine rule.He told the BBC: ""I have to consider coming back or not.""He also said the UK's quarantine rule ""makes no sense because in Germany [there is] a rate less than here and infection is more likely here in the UK than in Germany so for me it makes no sense.""Anyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine.There are also exemptions for workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care.The union representing UK Border Force staff said the rules were complex and they were not fully prepared. Lucy Moreton, professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that technical papers explaining what to check for only arrived on Friday and were still not available to those operating on the front line. She said there 42 categories that were exempt from the quarantine rules.Ms Moreton added there was no system for checking addresses and only flagrant rule-flouters - such as using the name Mickey Mouse - would be picked up. An internal memo, seen by the BBC, told Border Force agents that the fines would not apply to passengers arriving in the UK through Ireland, who are covered by a separate set of rules.The travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk.The manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses.British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have written to Procurator General Sir Jonathan Jones, the government's most senior legal official - the first stage required when taking legal action against the government.The airlines say they are prepared to ask for a judicial review into the government's travel quarantine rules. Travel trade body Abta has called on the government to urgently create a roadmap for restarting international travel, while the UK's biggest airport services company, Swissport, has warned it could deliver a ""killer blow"" to the tourism sector.Industry leaders wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson in May asking that the government avoid taking a ""blanket approach"" to quarantine, suggesting so-called ""air bridges"" with countries that have low coronavirus rates.Aviation, maritime and rail industry leaders were invited to discuss the new quarantine plans but British Airways refused to attend the meeting, and aviation bosses told the BBC that they were not impressed by the content of the call. BA is proposing to make 12,000 staff redundant. Separately, Heathrow Airport's chief executive has warned that about 25,000 jobs could be at risk at Heathrow Airport. Government sources have told the BBC that the UK is hoping to secure air bridge agreements with certain countries, such as Portugal, Spain and France, as well as Australia and Singapore.But the government's position is that the idea is only ""under consideration"".In other developments:",8 June 2020,business
UK to start post-Brexit trade talks with Japan,"The UK and Japan are set to begin talks on Tuesday aimed at reaching agreement on a post-Brexit trade deal.The negotiations come as London and Tokyo work towards replacing the agreement Britain currently has with Japan through the European Union.Without a new deal by 1 January 2021 the two countries will default to World Trade Organization trading terms.That would mean tariffs and obstacles to commerce between the UK and its fourth-largest non-EU trading partner.After decades of sharing its trade policy with the European Union, Britain is now embarking on free trade negotiations with countries around the world.Last month the UK launched formal talks with the United States and is also hoping to reach a trade agreement with the EU by the end of this year.Discussions with Brussels have proved to be particularly difficult, with no agreement so far on even the basic structure of what will be negotiated.Discussions with Japan will initially be held via video link and be between the UK's International Trade Secretary Liz Truss and Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs  Toshimitsu Motegi.Ms Truss said that she hopes to build on the existing pact between Tokyo and Brussels: ""We aim to strike a comprehensive free trade agreement that goes further than the deal previously agreed with the EU, setting ambitious standards in areas such as digital trade and services.""""This deal will provide more opportunities for businesses and individuals across every region and nation of the UK and help boost our economies following the unprecedented economic challenges posed by coronavirus,"" Ms Truss added.According to British government figures, trade between the two countries totalled £31.4bn last year, with 9,500 UK-based businesses exporting goods to Japan.The UK hopes that a free trade agreement with Japan will help it to eventually join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).Membership of the 11-member CPTPP, a trade agreement that stretches from Australia to Chile, would significantly improve access for UK businesses to markets across the Asia-Pacific region.",9 June 2020,business
UK post-Brexit drug stockpiles at risk amid virus,"The UK has been warned by the pharmaceutical industry that some stockpiles of medical supplies have been ""used up entirely"" by the virus.A memo seen by the BBC advises the government to buy and store ""critical"" medicines to treat the virus.Drug makers fear stockpiles cannot feasibly be built back up again in time, if the UK should fail to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU.The government said ""robust contingency plans are in place"".The spokesperson added: ""We want a relationship with the EU which is based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals and centred on free trade.""However, firms fear disruption to global supply chains will seriously impact the NHS.The internal pharmaceutical industry memo, which was prepared for the government in May, warns that after the pandemic ends, there will be ""less or zero product available in the market to allow for stockpiling a broad range of products"" than there was in 2019, when stockpiling occurred in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit. At the time, the industry itself paid for six weeks' worth of stockpiles.""Preparations for the end of the transition period must complement plans to secure the supply of coronavirus therapeutic and supportive products,"" the memo says.The pandemic has led to a massive increase in demand for medicines not previously stockpiled for critical care and respiratory medicines, such as inhalers.At the same time, coronavirus lockdown measures imposed by governments have caused significant supply bottlenecks due to factory closures and export bans, as well as a drastic decline in air freight.The memo was put together by a cross section of pharmaceutical industry groups anticipating preparations for a failure to strike a trade deal with the EU, alongside a refusal to extend the negotiating period. If this happens, the UK would trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, which would mean trade barriers from the start of next year.The memo goes on to remind the government that the flow of medicines has been kept going through the pandemic thanks to ""international coordination and information sharing within global companies to ramp up, and where necessary, redirect manufacturing"". As a result, the pharmaceutical industry writes: ""We would warn against any drastic policies mandating wholesale changes to global supply chains, as this could fundamentally disrupt the supply of medicines for the NHS and patients in other countries.""The pharmaceutical industry has long anticipated that a no-deal Brexit could cause congestion at the ports of Dover and Calais, which is the route that 90% of imported drugs and medicines from the EU take to get to the UK.As a result, the industry has advised that the government itself will have to buy and store a longer list of ""critical products"" where ""supply could be challenging due to either COVID-19 or the end of the [Brexit] transition period"". The need for trading stability is even more important this year, because the pattern of demand for medicines is likely to be very different to normal. That means, the memo says, that the government needs to develop a new broader list of critical products which ""reflect the challenges posed by both the end of the transition period and continues response"" to the coronavirus crisis.The memo also emphasises that the government needs to be storing a much broader list of medicines going forward, because of the joint challenge of the pandemic and in the event of a no-deal Brexit deal at the end of this year.But the pharmaceutical industry says that to have significant impact, the stockpiling will have to start in the next few weeks, and even after the pandemic ends, stockpiling will not be possible for every medicine required. In a normal year, Christmas would be ""the worst time of year to ask companies to increase their stockpile levels"", the memo says.The pharmaceutical industry is expecting the system of no-deal government-chartered freight ferries and aeroplanes to be re-established, given that border disruption is expected at the end of the Brexit transition period. It says the government needs to signal that this will be the case by next month. And it has requested ""urgent clarity"" on the implementation of arrangements for Irish Sea trade, under the Northern Ireland Protocol.The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), one of the organisations involved in drafting the report, says firms had ""worked around the clock"" during the pandemic to make sure medicine supply chains held up.""With this pressure likely to continue over the coming months, the pandemic has reinforced why it is essential that the UK and EU reach a deal on their future relationship,"" said ABPI's chief executive Dr Richard Torbett.In the meantime, he said its members would continue to work closely with government to put detailed plans in place. ""But not everything is in the gift of industry. Stockpiling is one element - having alternative supply routes and making sure that goods can continue to flow uninterrupted across borders is also critical,"" he stressed. ",8 June 2020,business
Nissan: UK factory still under threat from no-deal Brexit,"The UK's largest car manufacturing plant is ""unsustainable"" if the UK leaves the European Union without a trade deal, owner Nissan says.The Japanese company's global chief operating head told the BBC people had to understand the EU was the Sunderland factory's biggest customer.Ashwani Gupta said that Nissan's commitment could not be maintained if there was not tariff-free EU access.Nissan has invested billions of pounds in the plant, which has 7,000 workers.His comments come despite the Sunderland site surviving this week's announcement on the Japanese giant's global restructuring programme.  Mr Gupta said: ""You know we are the number one carmaker in the UK and we want to continue. We are committed. Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it's not our intention but the business will not be sustainable. That's what everybody has to understand.""He also said that any plans for its strategic partner and 43%-shareholder Renault to take up spare capacity at Sunderland would be a matter for the French carmaker. The French government has a 15% stake in Renault.This is not the first time that Nissan has pleaded with UK and EU negotiators to ensure that the 70% of cars manufactured at Sunderland which are sold in the EU can avoid tariffs of 10% under World Trade Organisation rules - the legal default position if a deal is not struck.Those talks resumed this week, with the differences between the UK and EU being described on all sides as deep and wide.Last week, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU would consider a two-year Brexit delay, which was rebuffed by his UK counterpart David Frost, who told MPs the government's policy remains not to extend the transition period beyond the end of the year.Under an agreement signed last year, the UK has until the end of this month to decide whether it wants to request such an extension so the coming weeks are crucial.The comments by Nissan may dampen hopes raised just last week when the company said that while it was closing plants in Spain and Indonesia, it remained committed to Sunderland.An announcement by Nissan that Renault might take the European lead in the companies' global manufacturing alliance (which also includes Mitsubishi) by taking up an estimated 20% spare capacity at Sunderland were quashed for the foreseeable future by Renault last week, when it said it had no current plans to move in to the UK.Mr Gupta confirmed that any decision by its partners would be a matter for them, and that no such deal had been agreed. ""When it comes to the allocation of manufacturing, each company will take the decision based on the competitiveness of the plants.""Nissan is a huge fan of the Sunderland plant and paid tribute to the efficiency and hard work of the operation. But it reiterated that was not enough to secure its long-term future if tariffs were imposed in a market which it described last week as ""non-core"". It only has a 3% market share of the vehicle market in Europe.On a more encouraging note, Mr Gupta said recent sales figures from China showed the world's biggest car market was recovering fast and the company was winning market share. But vehicles for that market are not produced in the UK. It is still possible that Renault could decide to move production of certain vehicles to Sunderland. But it is hard to see how a company which is 15%-owned by the French taxpayer could find a way to make that work where Nissan, which has been in Sunderland for 40 years, says it cannot.Nissan's comments are a timely reminder that for many key industries, the Brexit issue - which has not been silenced by coronavirus news - has in many ways been amplified by it.

Pandemic pushes US into official recession,"The economic downturn in the US triggered by the pandemic has been officially declared a recession.The National Bureau of Economic Research made the designation on Tuesday, citing the scale and severity of the current contraction.It said activity and employment hit a ""clear"" and ""well-defined"" peak in February, before falling.The ruling puts a formal end to what had been more than a decade of economic expansion - the longest in US history.Meanwhile, US markets continued their rebound on Monday, as investors remained optimistic that the downturn will be short-lived.A recession was expected after the US economy contracted 5% in the first three months of the year. Employers also reported cutting roughly 22 million jobs in March and April, as restrictions on activity intended to help control the virus forced many businesses to close.Some economists are hopeful that the job losses have now stopped, and a rebound has begun. In May, US employers added 2.5 million jobs, as states started reopening.The National Bureau of Economic Research,  a private research organisation, said it viewed the scale of the decline that started in February as more significant than its duration.""The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,"" it said.The bureau typically defines a recession as an economic contraction that lasts ""more than a few months"".It has declared 12 recessions since 1948, the longest of which was the Great Recession, which lasted 18 months, from December 2007 to June 2009.US financial markets, which tumbled in February amid signs of the economic collapse, have been on the upswing since March, due to investor hopes that economic damage will be limited, thanks to emergency relief from Congress and the central bank.On Monday, the Nasdaq index closed at 9,924.7, gaining 1.1% to top its pre-pandemic record.The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to close at 3.232.3 - returning to where it started the year - while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.7% to 27,572.4. The two indexes are now less than 10% lower than their pre-pandemic peaks.US President Donald Trump has celebrated the rebound.""Big day for Stock Market. Smart money, and the World, know that we are heading in the right direction. Jobs are coming back FAST. Next year will be our greatest ever,"" he wrote on Twitter on Monday morning.Big day for Stock Market. Smart money, and the World, know that we are heading in the right direction.

Samsung: Court rejects Lee Jae-yong arrest warrant request,"A court in Seoul has denied an arrest warrant request for Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong, after prosecutors accused him of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.The ruling provides at least temporary relief for the de facto head of the South Korean conglomerate.But Mr Lee isn't completely in the clear yet as prosecutors said they will continue with their investigation.They can still return with new evidence and seek another arrest warrant.Last week state prosecutors asked the court to issue an arrest warrant against Mr Lee related to their probe into accounting fraud and the controversial merger of two Samsung businesses, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, in 2015. Prosecutors said the deal helped his plan to take greater control of the group.On Friday Samsung denied the allegation of stock-manipulation against Mr Lee, saying it was ""beyond common sense"" to claim he was involved in the decision-making.In another statement over the weekend, the group said the lengthy probe is weighing on management, which is in ""crisis"" at a time when the coronavirus pandemic and US-China trade war are adding to uncertainty.Three top executives, including a vice president, have already been given prison sentences for hiding or destroying evidence in the probe.The 51-year-old, also known as Jay Y Lee, is the son of Lee Kun-hee, chairman of Samsung Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate. He is also the grandson of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul.With a degree from South Korea's top university and an MBA from one of Japan's most prestigious universities, he has been groomed to take over the family firm.He became a Samsung president in 2009 and in 2013 was made vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics, the division which makes devices including smartphones, televisions, cameras and hard drives.Since Mr Lee's father suffered a heart attack in 2014, he has been considered the de facto boss of the entire Samsung group of businesses.According to Forbes magazine, the divorced father-of-two has a net worth of around $6.6bn (£5.2bn).In February 2017, Lee Jae-yong was arrested and then charged over his alleged role in a political and corporate scandal linked to South Korea's then president, Park Geun-hye.Charges against Mr Lee included bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and perjury.Samsung was accused of paying 43bn won ($35.7m; £28.1m) to two non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Ms Park, in exchange for political support.More specifically, the favours were alleged to include backing for a controversial Samsung merger which paved the way for Mr Lee to become the head of the conglomerate, a deal that needed support from South Korea's government-run national pension fund.Mr Lee denied the charges. He admitted making donations but said Samsung did not want anything in return. In August 2017 a court convicted him of the charges and sent him to prison for five years.Six months later that sentence was halved, and the Seoul High Court decided to suspend the jail term, meaning he was free to go.",9 June 2020,business

The company said in a statement it would start reopening UK stores from 15 June. But it said social distancing measures and reduced tourist and footfall levels would continue to affect its income.Mulberry was founded in Somerset in 1971, where its two factories are still in production. As well as luggage and handbags - some of which carry a price tag of more than £1,000 - it also makes footwear, jewellery and eyewear.Thierry Andretta, Mulberry's chief executive, said the temporary closure of its physical stores would continue to have a marked effect on business.Mulberry said it had been able to re-open stores in China and South Korea and, more recently, some stores in Europe and Canada.  It has 120 stores in 25 countries, but also ships to 190 countries around the world.But it said that although the digital sales performance had been good, it could not fully offset the fall in demand caused by store closures. The company said: ""Even once stores reopen, social distancing measures, reduced tourist and footfall levels will continue to impact our revenue.  As a result of this, we must manage our operations and cost base accordingly to ensure the company is the correct size and structure to reflect market conditions.""The consultation process will last 45 days and affected staff are being contacted.Mulberry is one of the leading fashion brands that switched production from luxury goods to making medical equipment.

Pandemic pushes US into official recession,"The economic downturn in the US triggered by the pandemic has been officially declared a recession.The National Bureau of Economic Research made the designation on Tuesday, citing the scale and severity of the current contraction.It said activity and employment hit a ""clear"" and ""well-defined"" peak in February, before falling.The ruling puts a formal end to what had been more than a decade of economic expansion - the longest in US history.Meanwhile, US markets continued their rebound on Monday, as investors remained optimistic that the downturn will be short-lived.A recession was expected after the US economy contracted 5% in the first three months of the year. Employers also reported cutting roughly 22 million jobs in March and April, as restrictions on activity intended to help control the virus forced many businesses to close.Some economists are hopeful that the job losses have now stopped, and a rebound has begun. In May, US employers added 2.5 million jobs, as states started reopening.The National Bureau of Economic Research,  a private research organisation, said it viewed the scale of the decline that started in February as more significant than its duration.""The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,"" it said.The bureau typically defines a recession as an economic contraction that lasts ""more than a few months"".It has declared 12 recessions since 1948, the longest of which was the Great Recession, which lasted 18 months, from December 2007 to June 2009.US financial markets, which tumbled in February amid signs of the economic collapse, have been on the upswing since March, due to investor hopes that economic damage will be limited, thanks to emergency relief from Congress and the central bank.On Monday, the Nasdaq index closed at 9,924.7, gaining 1.1% to top its pre-pandemic record.The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to close at 3.232.3 - returning to where it started the year - while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.7% to 27,572.4. The two indexes are now less than 10% lower than their pre-pandemic peaks.US President Donald Trump has celebrated the rebound.""Big day for Stock Market.

Samsung: Court rejects Lee Jae-yong arrest warrant request,"A court in Seoul has denied an arrest warrant request for Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong, after prosecutors accused him of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.The ruling provides at least temporary relief for the de facto head of the South Korean conglomerate.But Mr Lee isn't completely in the clear yet as prosecutors said they will continue with their investigation.They can still return with new evidence and seek another arrest warrant.Last week state prosecutors asked the court to issue an arrest warrant against Mr Lee related to their probe into accounting fraud and the controversial merger of two Samsung businesses, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, in 2015. Prosecutors said the deal helped his plan to take greater control of the group.On Friday Samsung denied the allegation of stock-manipulation against Mr Lee, saying it was ""beyond common sense"" to claim he was involved in the decision-making.In another statement over the weekend, the group said the lengthy probe is weighing on management, which is in ""crisis"" at a time when the coronavirus pandemic and US-China trade war are adding to uncertainty.Three top executives, including a vice president, have already been given prison sentences for hiding or destroying evidence in the probe.The 51-year-old, also known as Jay Y Lee, is the son of Lee Kun-hee, chairman of Samsung Group, South Korea's largest conglomerate. He is also the grandson of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul.With a degree from South Korea's top university and an MBA from one of Japan's most prestigious universities, he has been groomed to take over the family firm.He became a Samsung president in 2009 and in 2013 was made vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics, the division which makes devices including smartphones, televisions, cameras and hard drives.Since Mr Lee's father suffered a heart attack in 2014, he has been considered the de facto boss of the entire Samsung group of businesses.According to Forbes magazine, the divorced father-of-two has a net worth of around $6.6bn (£5.2bn).In February 2017, Lee Jae-yong was arrested and then charged over his alleged role in a political and corporate scandal linked to South Korea's then president, Park Geun-hye.Charges against Mr Lee included bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and perjury.Samsung was accused of paying 43bn won ($35.7m; £28.1m) to two non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Ms Park, in exchange for political support.More specifically, the favours were alleged to include backing for a controversial Samsung merger which paved the way for Mr Lee to become the head of the conglomerate, a deal that needed support from South Korea's government-run national pension fund.Mr Lee denied the charges. He admitted making donations but said Samsung did not want anything in return. In August 2017 a court convicted him of the charges and sent him to prison for five years.Six months later that sentence was halved, and the Seoul High Court decided to suspend the jail term, meaning he was free to go.",9 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Mulberry plans to axe a quarter of its workforce,"Mulberry says it plans to cut 25% of its worldwide workforce, the vast majority of which work in the UK. The high-end fashion brand, which is best known for its leather goods, employs 1,400 people, including 1,140 in the UK. The company said in a statement it would start reopening UK stores from 15 June. But it said social distancing measures and reduced tourist and footfall levels would continue to affect its income.Mulberry was founded in Somerset in 1971, where its two factories are still in production. As well as luggage and handbags - some of which carry a price tag of more than £1,000 - it also makes footwear, jewellery and eyewear.Thierry Andretta, Mulberry's chief executive, said the temporary closure of its physical stores would continue to have a marked effect on business.Mulberry said it had been able to re-open stores in China and South Korea and, more recently, some stores in Europe and Canada.  It has 120 stores in 25 countries, but also ships to 190 countries around the world.But it said that although the digital sales performance had been good, it could not fully offset the fall in demand caused by store closures. The company said: ""Even once stores reopen, social distancing measures, reduced tourist and footfall levels will continue to impact our revenue.  As a result of this, we must manage our operations and cost base accordingly to ensure the company is the correct size and structure to reflect market conditions.""The consultation process will last 45 days and affected staff are being contacted.Mulberry is one of the leading fashion brands that switched production from luxury goods to making medical equipment. Last month it said it had set its handbag factory in Somerset to making 8,000 gowns for NHS workers in Bristol. Earlier this year, Mike Ashley's Frasers Group retail business bought a 12.5% stake in Mulberry.Mulberry has concession outlets within House of Fraser and also throughout John Lewis's department stores.

"Coronavirus: New UK travel quarantine rules a stunt, says Ryanair boss","New rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days have come into effect.Those arriving by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - must give an address where they will self-isolate. Rule breakers will be fined.Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the laws were designed ""to prevent a second wave"" of coronavirus.But the boss of Ryanair has said the rules are a ""political stunt"" and are not a quarantine.Michael O'Leary told the BBC: ""You could be in Sainsbury's, you could be on the beach, you could be on the golf course in the unlikely event the Home Office calls you - all they will have is a mobile number.""He claimed even the Home Office acknowledged the rules were unenforceable.  Some industries have warned they will be severely impacted by the rules, and Mr O'Leary warned of devastation. Despite criticism from businesses, Ms Patel has said the measures are ""proportionate"" and being implemented ""at the right time"".For more on the rules click here.Almost all travellers have to fill in a ""public health passenger locator"" form on arrival. Failure to do so could lead to a penalty of £100, or travellers may be refused entry. If they are unable to provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. It says there will also be checks to see whether the rules are being followed.One airline passenger who was flying out to Germany from Stansted for work but lives in the UK, said he may have to stay overseas for longer because of the 14-day quarantine rule.He told the BBC: ""I have to consider coming back or not.""He also said the UK's quarantine rule ""makes no sense because in Germany [there is] a rate less than here and infection is more likely here in the UK than in Germany so for me it makes no sense.""Anyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine.There are also exemptions for workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care.The union representing UK Border Force staff said the rules were complex and they were not fully prepared. Lucy Moreton, professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that technical papers explaining what to check for only arrived on Friday and were still not available to those operating on the front line. She said there 42 categories that were exempt from the quarantine rules.Ms Moreton added there was no system for checking addresses and only flagrant rule-flouters - such as using the name Mickey Mouse - would be picked up.

UK post-Brexit drug stockpiles at risk amid virus,"The UK has been warned by the pharmaceutical industry that some stockpiles of medical supplies have been ""used up entirely"" by the virus.A memo seen by the BBC advises the government to buy and store ""critical"" medicines to treat the virus.Drug makers fear stockpiles cannot feasibly be built back up again in time, if the UK should fail to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU.The government said ""robust contingency plans are in place"".The spokesperson added: ""We want a relationship with the EU which is based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals and centred on free trade.""However, firms fear disruption to global supply chains will seriously impact the NHS.The internal pharmaceutical industry memo, which was prepared for the government in May, warns that after the pandemic ends, there will be ""less or zero product available in the market to allow for stockpiling a broad range of products"" than there was in 2019, when stockpiling occurred in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit. At the time, the industry itself paid for six weeks' worth of stockpiles.""Preparations for the end of the transition period must complement plans to secure the supply of coronavirus therapeutic and supportive products,"" the memo says.The pandemic has led to a massive increase in demand for medicines not previously stockpiled for critical care and respiratory medicines, such as inhalers.At the same time, coronavirus lockdown measures imposed by governments have caused significant supply bottlenecks due to factory closures and export bans, as well as a drastic decline in air freight.The memo was put together by a cross section of pharmaceutical industry groups anticipating preparations for a failure to strike a trade deal with the EU, alongside a refusal to extend the negotiating period. If this happens, the UK would trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, which would mean trade barriers from the start of next year.The memo goes on to remind the government that the flow of medicines has been kept going through the pandemic thanks to ""international coordination and information sharing within global companies to ramp up, and where necessary, redirect manufacturing"". As a result, the pharmaceutical industry writes: ""We would warn against any drastic policies mandating wholesale changes to global supply chains, as this could fundamentally disrupt the supply of medicines for the NHS and patients in other countries.""The pharmaceutical industry has long anticipated that a no-deal Brexit could cause congestion at the ports of Dover and Calais, which is the route that 90% of imported drugs and medicines from the EU take to get to the UK.As a result, the industry has advised that the government itself will have to buy and store a longer list of ""critical products"" where ""supply could be challenging due to either COVID-19 or the end of the [Brexit] transition period"". The need for trading stability is even more important this year, because the pattern of demand for medicines is likely to be very different to normal. That means, the memo says, that the government needs to develop a new broader list of critical products which ""reflect the challenges posed by both the end of the transition period and continues response"" to the coronavirus crisis.The memo also emphasises that the government needs to be storing a much broader list of medicines going forward, because of the joint challenge of the pandemic and in the event of a no-deal Brexit deal at the end of this year.But the pharmaceutical industry says that to have significant impact, the stockpiling will have to start in the next few weeks, and even after the pandemic ends, stockpiling will not be possible for every medicine required. In a normal year, Christmas would be ""the worst time of year to ask companies to increase their stockpile levels"", the memo says.The pharmaceutical industry is expecting the system of no-deal government-chartered freight ferries and aeroplanes to be re-established, given that border disruption is expected at the end of the Brexit transition period. It says the government needs to signal that this will be the case by next month. And it has requested ""urgent clarity"" on the implementation of arrangements for Irish Sea trade, under the Northern Ireland Protocol.The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), one of the organisations involved in drafting the report, says firms had ""worked around the clock"" during the pandemic to make sure medicine supply chains held up.""With this pressure likely to continue over the coming months, the pandemic has reinforced why it is essential that the UK and EU reach a deal on their future relationship,"" said ABPI's chief executive Dr Richard Torbett.In the meantime, he said its members would continue to work closely with government to put detailed plans in place. ""But not everything is in the gift of industry. Stockpiling is one element - having alternative supply routes and making sure that goods can continue to flow uninterrupted across borders is also critical,"" he stressed. ",8 June 2020,business
Public investment 'is key to escaping crisis',"A former US treasury secretary says public investment will be key as the world recovers from the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis.Larry Summers told the BBC that central banks are going to become ""less relevant"", as interest rates are going to be near zero for much of the time. ""Fiscal policies are going to be more important in supporting economic expansion,"" he said.""And public investment policies are going to play a larger part.""Mr Summers, who is now an economic adviser to Joe Biden's presidential campaign, told Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme that ""for those with an agenda around infrastructure, there's huge opportunity in this moment"".Without a doubt, there will be voices right now raising warnings of the political dangers and tax implications of such a growth in state intervention, but none of the economists The World This Weekend spoke to were among them.Gerard Lyons, chief economist to Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London and a high profile supporter of Brexit, said such spending is affordable: ""Clearly, there is a need at some stage to bring government debt down, in terms of the size of its economy, as we did after the Second World War. But the key thing is that low inflation, low rates and low yields allows the government to sustain a much higher level of borrowing after this crisis.""For some on the left, the inevitability of more government spending - on both benefits and big job-creating projects - is an opportunity. The prospect has certainly cheered up the markets, with a recent rally on Wall Street. But Professor Mariana Mazzucato, Director of the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose at University College London (UCL), says it is vital that any public spending project is well-focused.""If we keep just arriving to the problem once the problem presents itself, so from one crisis to another - the financial crisis, the climate crisis, the health crisis - we're not going to get out of this constant crisis mode,"" she said. ""Most of what governments are currently doing worldwide, the trillions that are being thrown at the problem globally, is really just correcting for a problem.""Instead, she says, we should ""structure that immediate short-term remedy with a long-run kind of vision"" of what kind of economy we would like to create afterwards. ""This is the moment for government to do that, because it has the upper hand,"" she added. Most economists warn of a phenomena they call ""secular stagnation"" - a long-term lack of growth. This can frighten off both consumers and investors, leading to a lack of investment and innovation that spirals down into greater unemployment and poverty. Allianz's chief economic advisor Mohamed El Erian says it is a danger which needs to be avoided.""You need to win the war against a health threat and you need to win the war against an economic depression, but you also need to win the peace of sustained, high and inclusive growth… I worry that we will end up winning the war, but we may fail in winning the peace,"" he told the BBC.""Difficult decisions have to be made early on as to how you allocate the relief measures you have…what some developing countries are discovering is they simply can't replay the playbook that has been used in the richer countries - they have to come up with something different that recognises that they're in there for the long haul.""Well before the crisis, the idea of a globally-linked economy was, if not under threat, then being questioned - did it benefit very few, to the detriment of millions? That was one of the pressures behind the wave of new nationalism, and with it, talks of new barriers to protect individual countries' economies against foreign competition. The economists the BBC spoke to are agreed there will be one big change in supply lines following the pandemic - ""just in time"" will be replaced by ""just in case"". Manufacturers will build in greater redundancy and look to buying vital components closer to home, but active barriers against world trade are a different story.Professor Beata Javorcik is chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. She says a big worry is that populist leaders could use incidents of shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE) being stopped at the border to ""promote more protectionism"".""It would be very easy to use instruments that are available under the World Trade Organization rules to introduce tariffs against subsidised imports…so in the absence of global commitment to free trade the world may just sleep walk into protectionism,"" she said. Even the sharpest minds can only predict the outline of a new world, but it is inevitable these changes will bring a political reaction.The future is not written in stone or in the stars, nor can it been fully discerned by peering at statistics and graphs. That is in large measure because it depends on choices yet to be made by voters and governments, investors and companies.The old cliché runs ""never waste a good crisis"" and certainly, many of the centre left are hopeful that the end result of this pandemic may have, in their eyes, some positive consequences, from more international cooperation to greater government support for domestic programmes they favour, like healthcare and re-training. But increased poverty all over the world, with little prospect of a rapid reversal of a downward spiral, is a dark background as our century enters its twenties.

"BA 'dismissal threat' undermines talks, pilots' union Balpa says","The pilots' union Balpa has accused British Airways of undermining talks over proposed job losses by threatening to dismiss and re-hire its members under new contracts.The airline proposes to make 12,000 staff redundant, as it struggles with the impact of the pandemic, with more than 1,000 pilot roles at risk.  British Airways said it was acting now to protect as many jobs possible.It insisted no final decision had been made.Balpa has been meeting with the company, unlike some unions, including Unite and GMB, which BA says have refused to enter talks.But Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton said on Saturday night that those talks now hung ""by a thread"".""Balpa reps have been in consultation with BA over its proposed 1,130 pilot job losses and we've been doing that constructively and in good faith,"" Mr Strutton said in a statement.""Then, on Wednesday evening, a letter from BA added another 125 job losses and also for the first time threatened all 4,300 BA pilots with dismissal and reengagement if we did not reach agreement on changes to terms and conditions. ""I'm appalled at the cavalier attitude shown by BA towards the Balpa reps and to its pilots. ""This has seriously undermined our talks which now hang by a thread.""Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA's parent company IAG, emphasized this week in a letter to Parliament that no decision had been made in relation to actual redundancies.""There are some who believe the company is exaggerating the scale of the challenge,"" Mr Walsh said in the letter. ""Nothing could be further from the truth. The situation is unprecedented."" British Airways said it was acting now to protect as many jobs possible, as the airline industry faced the deepest structural change in its history. It called on Unite and the GMB to consult with it on its proposals as Balpa was doing.Separately, BA, Easyjet and Ryanair have made inroads towards a legal challenge to the government's plan to impose two weeks' quarantine on travellers entering, or returning to, the UK. The three have written a letter to Procurator General Sir Jonathan Jones, the government's most senior legal official. In it, they argue the rules for incoming travellers will be more stringent than those for people who are actually diagnosed as having coronavirus - and point out that the rules are governed by different legislation for residents of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The proposals have been roundly criticised across the travel industry. The Home Office has said it believes the measures will help stop the spread of the virus.  A government spokesperson said: ""As we get the virus under control here, we must manage the risk of cases being imported from abroad.""These measures are informed by science, backed by the public and will keep us all safe. ""We recognise it is a difficult time for the travel industry, and the government continues to work with industry partners to ensure these measures remain effective and necessary.""The boss of Getlink - formerly Groupe Eurotunnel - has also written to the government, criticising the plan for its burden of paperwork, for instance the efforts that would be needed to keep track of workers who cross the channel frequently.""The exemption to quarantine for staff who cross the Channel many times a day, within the concession, turns out to be an administrative burden for each crossing that will require much time to set up and deliver,"" wrote Getlink's chief executive Jacques Gounon. He also complained to Prime Minister Boris Johnson about the speed of the new rules.""Limited consultation by the Home Office and departmental intransigence have led to a situation that puts a serious risk on the efficiency of operations at the Channel Tunnel, a vital link in the Great British supply chain,"" he wrote.",8 June 2020,business
"'My first collection failed, it was heartbreaking'","The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to shoe designer Luis Onofre.Luis Onofre openly admits that his first foray into luxury shoe design could have been his last. The Portuguese designer launched his first namesake collection in 1993, shortly after taking over his family's shoe factory.His father had warned him it wouldn't sell, and his dad was proved correct. Consumers weren't interested, and the shoes bombed.""My lack of market knowledge was to blame,"" says the 49-year-old. ""It was heartbreaking, a big lesson for me. It was very humbling.""Today things are very different. Luis's glamorous designs are sold worldwide, and Michelle Obama, actress Naomi Watts, and socialite Paris Hilton are among his fans.He has also become a symbol of a recent renaissance in Portuguese shoemaking, helping to put the country firmly back on the haute couture map.Luis, who was born in Oliveira de Azemeis near Porto, in northern Portugal, grew up around shoes. His grandfather opened a footwear factory in the town in 1938, and the business has been been run by the family ever since.By the late 1980s, Luis's father was running the business, which was producing high-end shoes for French brands such as Cacharel and Galleries Lafayette.But when he asked Luis to join the company, the younger Onofre was reluctant, having set his heart on studying interior design. ""I remember seeing the stresses my parents brought home and thinking, 'I want to run away from that,'"" Luis recalls. He changed his mind, however, and took a degree in shoe design, before becoming managing director of the company in 1993. Keen to shake things up, he got the factory to start producing its own designs, not just those of other people. And the pain of seeing his first collection flop only made him more determined to reach his goal.""I knew I wanted to do my own brand, but after my first attempt went wrong I decided to gain experience and resilience in the area. This sector is ever-changing, fashion changes, new technologies change all the time.""For the next six years he continued to make shoes for other brands, while honing his design ideas on the side. Finally his moment came in 1999 when he launched a 50-piece collection at Momad, a major shoe trade fair in Spain. Interest in the brand grew following big investments in marketing, and sales picked up.""We started doing the shoe fair circuit, in Milan, Paris, Moscow,"" Luis says. ""Clients started requesting more exclusive designs. Our collections became more complex.""More The Boss features:Today he is best known for his women's shoes, which retail for around €300-€400 (£265-£355; $335-$445), and are all made in Portugal. His designs have been described as ""sexy"" and ""decadent"", and often incorporate elements such as Swarovski crystals or vertiginously high heels. Now based in Porto, the business turned over €8m last year, and employs 60 people across its commercial operations, factory and flagship stores. It also continues to make footwear for other brands such as Jimmy Choo and H&M.Despite his success, Luis has had to overcome other setbacks as a businessman, including an industry downturn in the 1990s. Portugal's shoe-making sector is centuries old, and considered on a par with Italy's and Spain's, despite being less well known. But in the late 1980s it was hit hard after Portugal joined the European Economic Community - the precursor to the European Union - in 1986, opening up the economy to foreign competition. The country's footwear industry wasn't ready for the change, and many factories had to close over the next decade. ""In the early 1990s, we lost almost all of the international clients we had,"" Luis recalls.Portugal's reputation for shoe making fell into decline, but Luis and other forward-thinking designers were determined to save it. ""We still had a generation of factory owners that did not understand contemporary fashion, or what was being sold internationally,"" he says. Over the past 20 years, however, he says a new wave of ""open-minded"" designers have brought fresh ideas to the table and turned things around. Portugal has regained its reputation for high-end design, factories have been retooled, and thousands of new jobs have been created. It's helped the country become a key player in the global shoe market, with exports totalling €1.8bn in 2019, up from €1.3bn in 2010. Paulo Goncalves, a spokesman for the Portuguese Footwear, Components and Leather Goods Manufacturers' Association, describes Luis as part of a ""fresh generation of designers"" that brought about change. ""Luis brought a new discourse to the shoe industry, putting talent and creativity at the forefront of an internationalisation strategy,"" he says.Luis's business still faces challenges, though. Shoemakers across Europe were already struggling with weaker consumer demand, and rising competition from China, when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Now the global luxury goods market is in a deep freeze. To help out during the global health crisis, Luis paused shoe production at his factory last month to instead make thousands of face masks that were donated to Portuguese citizens.Shoe manufacturing is now up and running again, and Luis is focusing on increasing online sales as physical stores around the world remain closed. He is also betting on a rebound in Asian markets that are further ahead in lifting Covid-19 restrictions.",8 June 2020,business
Is coronavirus changing the world of cleaning?,"""Before, we had basic cleaning standards when handling luggage but sanitation was not a priority,"" says Stasher's co-founder and chief executive, Jacob Wedderburn-Day. ""It absolutely will be now."" The storage company uses spots such as hotel luggage rooms to stash bags - 300,000 bags have been stored over the last 12 months.Before the coronavirus crisis hit, the business could expect between 500 and 1,500 transactions every day. But Mr Wedderburn-Day doesn't see numbers at that level happening until there's a vaccine for Covid-19.In the meantime, he is considering cleaning ideas that could reassure customers when they come back. It's an issue many businesses will face. Hotels, airlines, shops and restaurants will all want customers to be confident that their premises are as clean as possible.More Technology of Business""The virus is here to stay,"" says virologist Byron Martina from Artemis One Health Research Foundation in the Netherlands. ""Normally, the longer a virus stays in the population the less aggressive it becomes. However, that may be a process of years,"" he says.""A virus is nothing more than the virus chromosome that is protected against the environment by a shield, and in some viruses, like the coronavirus, the shield is further surrounded by a fat layer (the membrane),"" says Dr Martina.That membrane can be dissolved by old-fashioned detergents. But customers, concerned about the coronavirus, might want an extra level of reassurance.One option could be to make surfaces clean themselves. Danish company ACT.Global sells a transparent coating that can be sprayed on surfaces and breaks down microbes. It reacts when illuminated and works with normal indoor light.  Coats last up to a year, but the effectiveness of this technology also rests on how much light is available - it's not much good in dark places.To work, the coating needs eight hours of light, roughly equivalent to that in a standard family living room.""Let's face it, travel will likely increase. And with it the risk that pathogens, once geographically contained, can rapidly spread. To rebound and restore confidence, measures have to be taken to protect against the risk of further pathogenic outbreaks,"" says Christopher Lüscher, the chief technology officer at ACT.Global.Other companies are hoping that ultraviolet (UV) radiation will prove to be an effective way of destroying viruses.In particular the shortest wavelength, UVC, scrambles the DNA of organisms, killing them off. The Solaris Lytbot uses far-UVC, an even shorter wavelength that is less harmful to humans and combines that with UVB and UVA rays that heat and cool and confuse pathogens.The more problems pathogens face, the harder it is for them to survive. The Lytbot runs in three or five-minute cycles, depending on the size of the space, and it remains stationary, although the company is looking to add autonomous navigation. The head moves 360 degrees to target surfaces. But cleaning really big spaces, like sports stadiums, presents a bigger challenge.Lucid Drone Technologies has adapted its drones to spray disinfectant and can cover up to 23,000 sq ft (2,140 sq m) an hour.It is potentially a way to clean sports stadiums and the company says it is in talks with NFL teams. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the drones were used for exterior cleaning of multi-storey buildings, a business that has slowed down.Based in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company has built a dozen sanitation drones and has the ability to build 10 drones per week, says Lucid's co-founder and chief executive Andrew Ashur.Six cleaning companies have already signed deals to use the sanitation drones and the first batch are being delivered this month.Mr Ashur says he has been asked about using his drones for dust suppression, cleaning and maintaining windmill turbines and water towers, and oddly enough, vulture repellent.  But professional cleaners are wary of hi-tech methods.Richard Sticklee's firm, Enviropure First Response, cleans up crime scenes and hazardous spills.He says nothing beats the human touch for professional cleaning. While drone cleaning and hi-tech sprays can help with larger spaces, Mr Sticklee says being experienced, knowledgeable and trained on how to disinfect is essential.And he points out that soap and hot water is the best way to get rid of the virus.But for many companies the lockdown has either put a dent in sales or wiped them out altogether and that could curtail any investment in hi-tech cleaning.""Profitability is of way more importance than growth for us in the next year,"" says Jacob Wedderburn-Day of Stasher, noting that the company has been ""ruthless"" about cutting costs. ""When you get hit by a bus running a marathon, you don't get up and worry about winning. You go to the hospital and run again next year,"" he says. ",5 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Sex workers fear for their future,"With social distancing rules in place and strip clubs and brothels closed, sex workers around the world have seen their incomes disappear almost overnight as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Fearing for their livelihoods, as well as their health, some are offering services online to keep their business going, while others are turning to charities for help.Estelle Lucas has worked as an escort for the past 10 years in Melbourne, carefully building relationships with her clients. But the spread of Covid-19 and the need for social distancing has prompted a ban on sex work, leaving her worried those efforts will go to waste.  ""It's fair to say that if I'm not working for six months, a lot of people are going to forget me,"" she says.""I can't contact my clients and just have a conversation with them. That doesn't work in my industry. We need to build intimacy and that's just not possible in the current environment."" Before the coronavirus outbreak, Estelle says she was earning an above-average income, and had hoped to soon pay off the mortgage on her home in Melbourne's inner suburbs. Now nearly all her income has been lost. She has tried to adapt by moving her business online, but says that cannot replace physical contact.""Unfortunately, there are things that can't be translated,"" she says. ""I have made efforts to go online but not everyone is tech savvy. Some of my clients don't even really know how to use a smartphone.""While the regional government has outlined a clear roadmap to reopening restaurants and cafes, there has been no plan for the sex industry. That uncertainty, coupled with the many unknowns surrounding the virus itself, has left many sex workers with deep anxiety. ""I'm scared that all my work will come back to zero and I will just have to start hustling like I did when I first started out,"" Estelle says. She also fears for her clients' health. ""Are they even going to be there?"" she says. ""There's a lot of nervous energy going around.""Financial assistance from the Australian government is available to those who have lost their income because of the Covid-19 crisis, but to qualify for the payments workers need to be able to show they have been paying tax - something that unregistered sex workers including migrants and trans people, often won't be able to do. It's a problem facing sex workers in dozens of countries around the world, according to Teela Sanders, a criminology professor at the University of Leicester. ""Governments have been very good at providing social protection for the majority of people, particularly self-employed people, but sex workers are not included,"" she says.That's left sex worker collectives and advocacy groups calling for members of the public to donate to emergency funds. So far, an online appeal by the Las Vegas Sex Worker Collective has raised $19,300 (£15,680) while a campaign by a coalition of support groups in Italy has raised almost €21,700 (£19,500).""These have been a real lifeline to sex workers for immediate bill paying, access to food etc,"" says Prof Sanders. Some sex workers have been forced to continue working, risking hefty fines or exposure to the virus. ""In developing countries, sex workers are often the main breadwinner for the whole family, for their siblings, their children and their grandparents. So this affects the whole extended family,"" Prof Sanders says.Niki Adams from the English Collective of Prostitutes echoes that view. She told the BBC most sex workers in the UK are mothers and if they are continuing to work, it is because they are desperate for money. But some sex workers find themselves unable to keep working - even if they would choose to. In Daulatdia brothel in Bangladesh, police guard the entrance, preventing customers from entering. It is one of the world's biggest brothels, a shanty town made up of tin sheds and narrow alleyways that is home to 1,300 women and their 400 children.The brothel has been closed since March, leaving many of the women struggling to buy essential items and relying on donations from charities.  ""We cannot work now, so we don't have any income, which is scary,"" says ""Nazma"", who didn't want to give her real name. Nazma supports three children who live with her sister back in her village. She came to the brothel 30 years ago when she was just seven. Although she needs money, she worries about the dangers of working during the pandemic.""Even if we could work, people's lives are at risk from the virus. We'd be scared to go to bed with our clients anyway, as we don't know who is affected,"" she says.Daulatdia sits on the banks of the Padma River, near a major ferry terminal. It is the main transport hub that connects the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka with the country's southern districts. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, thousands of truck drivers would pass through the area every day, delivering agricultural products and other goods to Dhaka. Many of the women and children who live in the brothel are victims of trafficking. ""A lot of them who were kidnapped as children were sold there,"" says Srabanti Huda, a lawyer and human rights activist based in Dhaka.While the Bangladeshi government and local aid organisations have delivered some emergency funds to the women, Srabanti says it hasn't been enough and some women received nothing at all. ""The amount of donations they've received from the government does not even cover a packet of powdered milk for the children,"" she says. In early May, Srabanti organised a private aid delivery, distributing packets of basic supplies for each of the 1,300 women registered at the brothel. ""There was one woman who said she has not been able to get her insulin or diabetic medications for over a month,"" Srabanti says. ""Another said she has not been able to buy her blood pressure medications since the lockdown started two months ago.""Reduced access to healthcare services is an issue facing sex workers globally, according to Prof Sanders. The problem is particularly acute in areas where there is high demand for regular antiviral drugs from those living with HIV.""There's been real issues around access,"" she says. Prof Sanders is working with a team in Nairobi to develop an ""Uber-style"" app that will enable sex workers to order medication using their phones and have it delivered. ""It's sent directly to them via a mode of transport rather than the person coming into the clinic,"" she says. Back in Daulatdia brothel, another sex worker who didn't want to be named is returning from a trip to see her daughter, who lives in a nearby home for the children of sex workers. Even when the brothel reopens, it will take a long time for the industry to recover, she says.""People are afraid if they come to us, they might get infected,"" she says. ""We are afraid too. We might get infected from them. This fear of getting infected will come up all the time.""Additional reporting by Salman Saeed.",3 June 2020,business
'You audition for a show only for it to get cancelled’,"Elliot Swann caught his mum spying through the kitchen window as he practised ballet in their garden.Despite still being physically closed, ArtsEd, the London-based acting conservatory where Elliot studies musical theatre, has powered on virtually since the start of the coronavirus lockdown. Alongside classmates on Zoom meetings, Elliot, 21, drills voice practices and dance moves on the garden decking, and taps away in the bathroom of his parents' house in Hampshire. But will there be any work for him and his fellow students after they graduate this summer?Normally, at this time of year, acting students around the world are making their first foray into the business, performing in person for agents, casting directors and producers, hoping to sign on with a talent agency, or even pick up their first paid work.But with theatres still closed, and TV and movie filming on hold, the acting world is currently an industry on pause.""All of our work has stopped,"" says James Calleri, who casts Broadway and regional theatre in New York as well as film and TV. ""Everything has just been cleared.""Mr Calleri, who also runs the graduate acting programme at New York's Columbia University, would normally have taken graduating students on an industry tour of Los Angeles back in April.They would have performed for some of the big showbiz decision makers. But all Columbia's acting school showcases were cancelled, indefinitely.""We were going to push to September, but the problem is that theatres are so debilitated right now,"" Mr Calleri says. ""They don't even know what their life is going to be like after lockdown.""Any auditions that are still taking place have moved to home recordings or ""self tapes"" that are emailed off. Back in Hampshire, Elliot has made it though five rounds of recalls for a West End show.""The good thing is you get a second chance,"" he says. ""You can watch it back, and if you want, you can do it again.""Elliot's professors are also happy to give feedback and guidance before the videos are sent out, something that would not be possible with in-person auditions. ""The [movie and TV] businesses have been moving auditions to self tapes for some time, but I think plays and musicals will head that way too, even after the virus,"" says Chris Hocking, the principal of ArtsEd. ""Everyone is trying to help these graduates. We have worked hard so that the students have industry contact throughout their training.""What continues for Elliot is a waiting game. An actor almost never receives feedback unless they win the job. ""Especially now,"" he says, ""because everything is extended. And many tours have had to cancel because of the lockdown.""There is every chance you might be auditioning for a show, you could get cast, and then a couple of weeks later they'll say, 'I'm really sorry, it's been cancelled.'""Elliot knows he is lucky to be getting seen. Many new graduates are not getting any industry face-time. Racheal Owens, a teacher at Guildford School of Acting, says their graduates were due to have a final day of performance for agents and casting directors back in March. But a day before the show, the lockdown restrictions were announced, and it was cancelled. ""Some students had signed, but others had not, and would have been hoping for more opportunities, as we had two musicals left to perform,""she says. The staff at Guildford have continued to do everything possible to get self tapes to agents. Luckily the industry in London has been receptive, in an effort to support this year's graduates, but there is very little work available.""I really feel for these students, whose introduction to the industry is so compromised,"" says Ms Owens.A missed in-person performance can make life especially difficult for young actors with an offbeat style, or unusual looks, that might not come across well in a short self tape, plus resumé (CV) and headshot.Such performers are more likely to win over agents and casting directors in person.But even if young actors impress, however they are able to audition, how long will it be before the industry can return to some sort of normal?James Calleri wonders how the practical experience of going to the theatre would work with social distancing. Producers might sell out a 1,200-seat Broadway theatre, but if 600 people sit in every other seat in order to socially distance, shows will fail to recoup costs, he points out. In smaller theatres, social distancing would be impossible. ""The class of 2020 is the injured party right now,"" he says. ""I feel like the industry knows that and hopefully will try and look out for them.""More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Alex Butler, who runs the New York boutique agency Henderson Hogan, warns his recent signings that things aren't going to get better overnight. ""I told them, 'Look, if you are in this for the long haul, come to the city, get your apartment, your day job and your classes set up. Once things go back, we can gear up.'""But it could be a long wait. Mr Butler says he would love for Broadway to reopen in September but fears curtains may not rise until next year. Still, he thinks that sometime down the road, if young actors coming out of school this year can hold tight, there will be opportunities to audition for these shows. ""People working on Broadway might decide they are done with the business, or if they are touring, their spouses won't want them to go on the road anymore,"" he says. New York casting director Alison Franck, who casts Broadway, touring and regional musical theatre shows, says that actors have always needed to be creative and resilient. Those attributes are needed now more than ever, because many will struggle to get agents straight away.""These actors have to learn how to hustle on their own,"" she says. ""And I think the ones who figure this out may often end up being more successful in the long run.""Elliot understands how hard the current situation is, but he is ready to dig in. He believes the industry will come back ""stronger than ever"". Acting has been his dream for his whole life.""I'm absolutely in it for the long haul,"" he says.",4 June 2020,business
"Coronavirus: Job-hunting advice for graduates, from the Class of 2008","Graduates face even tougher competition for jobs this summer because of the coronavirus pandemic.About 400,000 students finishing their degrees in 2020 have seen opportunities evaporate overnight.Twelve years ago, graduates faced similar anxiety when the global financial crisis threw much of the world into recession. Banks collapsed, businesses went under, and millions of people lost their jobs.But what can the Class of 2008 teach the Class of 2020? We asked three graduates from 2008 what advice they would give to their younger counterparts.I think I'm one of the lucky ones from 2008.I studied law at Warwick University. I was finishing my legal practice course (LPC) when law firms started contacting people to defer their training contracts. My friends and I were all in the same boat. So when the phone rang, I already knew what they'd say. My training contract was deferred for two years, but luckily the firm offered me a job as a paralegal.The salary was about £6,000-a-year lower, but I was working in insolvency and litigation at the time so I was always busy.By the time I qualified in 2012, they were still making people redundant. There weren't any jobs in the area I wanted to go into, so I left my law firm and decided to see the world.  I ended up in Australia, where I've been working ever since, first in financial services and now in IT as a commercial manager.People have challenged me about my longevity in a job. I've been asked: am I a flight risk? And I just say that my CV is a product of the financial crisis.I took roles that helped me to build skills that I would use in the future. I never sat waiting to be given something. And when you explain that, it resonates with people, especially the older generation.There's a great speech by Steve Jobs (the co-founder of Apple) who said, ""You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.""When I look back I realise that things don't always work out. But you have to regroup and say: what do I need to do to move forward?I was 11 years old when I knew I wanted to become a pilot. I even thought about applying to the Royal Air Force straight after finishing A-levels. But my careers adviser told me a university degree would look better on the application form. I'd get paid more and be promoted more quickly. So I went to the University of Wales to study ancient history and archaeology. By the time I graduated in 2008, the opportunities were already drying up. The RAF recruitment office told me they weren't recruiting for certain roles like pilots. I couldn't even wait a year to apply again because I'd be too old. I was gutted. There weren't any graduate jobs left where I'm from in Sunderland. So I used a scattergun approach to apply for anything going. In the end I spent a year working at a call centre. After that, I worked at a lighthouse for six months and then a steel factory. For six years I worked my way up from the production line to sales and operations, before moving to an IT company.By then I'd spent a decade working for other people. I have a daughter who's 10 years old now. Little things like having to ask for a day's holiday just to see her school play made me rethink my career. So I used my experience to set up WL Distillery in County Durham last year. We crowdfunded our first batch of premium gin.And then the pandemic hit. The Chinese factory making some of our equipment was mothballed so we couldn't make gin. But we saw there was a massive hand sanitiser shortage, so we decided to use our ingredients to make small batches for the NHS, local schools and businesses.My advice to recent graduates is to stay as positive as you can and stop fixating on things that don't work out. I thought my life was mapped out: go to university, get a job, stay for life, and get a nice retirement package at the end with a watch. And that's not the world we live in anymore.So be open to opportunities that you may not have planned for. Working in a call centre was where I learned the right way to treat and talk to staff. It's amazing the skills you pick up in jobs that you don't even realise.I'm ashamed to say it now, but when I graduated in 2008 I thought people would throw opportunities at me. I knew there was a financial crisis going on, but I believed the market almost owed me a job. I had a history degree from Oxford University and was always a high achiever. I also lacked humility in a very big way.At the time I was gunning for graduate schemes at consumer goods giants like Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser. When I didn't get anywhere, I started applying to advertising agencies, and big retailers like Tesco. I think I filled in about 110 applications. I got about five interviews.After four months of trying and no job to show for it, I ended up moving back home to Southampton where I took a job as a medical receptionist.I felt embarrassed and had lost confidence. That job made me realise I wasn't as good as I thought I was. So many people I worked with could do my job better than me.After that I got an internship at Oxfam. This was instrumental because I made a lot of contacts and eventually did a masters degree in management. That got me on the career path I'm on now, which led to my current job at a digital consultancy. It's also where I met my husband!In retrospect, I held graduate schemes in really high esteem, which was actually a bit silly. For example, when I didn't succeed at Unilever, I simply gave up. I didn't think about looking for an entry-level job to get a foot in the door there.I'd say to recent graduates: don't be afraid to ask for help, and take advantage of the things you take for granted. Back in 2008, we were entering the job market as the early users of Facebook and Twitter, so we could educate companies on how to use those platforms.Businesses today are still trying to figure out TikTok, so don't underestimate the power of your digital knowledge.",5 June 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Coronavirus: May 'another month of struggle for retail',"May was another tough month for retail as coronavirus lockdown measures continued, a trade body says. Total UK sales fell by 5.9% compared with the previous year, dragged down by temporary shop closures, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.Online sales growth rose fifteenfold to 60.2%, but failed to offset this drop.Separately, Barclaycard figures suggested a further boost in supermarket sales as people made the most of warm weather.May was ""yet another month of struggle for retailers across the country"", the BRC's chief executive Helen Dickinson said.The BRC and KPMG survey suggested a decline in sales that was the second worst on record, after a huge drop in April.""For those shops whose doors remain shuttered, it was once again a tough month and even those who stayed open suffered reduced footfall and huge costs implementing social distancing measures,"" she added.""While the month showed record growth in online sales, many retailers will be anxious to see whether demand returns to our High Streets when non-essential shops reopen from 15 June.""Online sales accounted for almost 62% of all retail sales in May, the survey said. In April, online sales accounted for about 70% of all sales, but previously it was 43.5% in March, 31% in February. And prior to February, online sales had only accounted for around 20% of all sales.Despite the overall drop in total retail sales, food sales rose strongly in May by 8.7% like-for-like, ""with consumers taking to their local parks for beers, barbeques and picnics,"" Ms Dickinson said.Computing and office supplies sales also did well, as did fitness equipment, continuing a lockdown trend, the BRC said. Toys and baby equipment rose too, it said.However, sales of health and beauty products, furniture, clothing, footwear and jewellery all fell.""The disparity between different types of retailers and categories continues, with clear divides between essential and online versus non-essential and physical,"" said Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at KPMG.""Many non-essential categories - especially fashion - continued to attract limited demand, which will increase the pressure on them in the coming months.""He added that although stores would be opening again from 15 June onwards, it would be ""gradual"" with safety the most prominent concern, and some shops might not open at all""Stores may soon have the greenlight to re-open but it will be a gradual affair with safety front of mind, and some doors may not reopen at all.""Covid-19 has acted as an accelerant in the shift towards having less of a physical presence, not least due to the obvious need to radically reduce costs for survival,"" he added.Over the longer term, the temporary closures of many High Street shops have had a huge effect on non-food in store sales, the BRC figures suggested.Over the three months to May, non-food in store sales dropped 50.3% on a total basis.The data from Barclaycard indicates that supermarket spending rose by 24.5% in May.This increased to 27% in the week preceding the Victory in Europe (VE) Day weekend ""as Brits made the most of the sunny bank holiday,"" it said.Continuing another lockdown trend, consumers ""remained loyal to local specialist food and drink outlets, such as greengrocers and independent convenience stores, with the category seeing a growth of 42.5% - the highest increase since restrictions were introduced,"" Barclaycard said.The higher spending in supermarkets helped offset a 49.7% drop in spending on fuel, Barclaycard said. Roads were much quieter in May as lockdown measures continued.",9 June 2020,business
Pandemic pushes US into official recession,"The economic downturn in the US triggered by the pandemic has been officially declared a recession.The National Bureau of Economic Research made the designation on Tuesday, citing the scale and severity of the current contraction.It said activity and employment hit a ""clear"" and ""well-defined"" peak in February, before falling.The ruling puts a formal end to what had been more than a decade of economic expansion - the longest in US history.Meanwhile, US markets continued their rebound on Monday, as investors remained optimistic that the downturn will be short-lived.A recession was expected after the US economy contracted 5% in the first three months of the year. Employers also reported cutting roughly 22 million jobs in March and April, as restrictions on activity intended to help control the virus forced many businesses to close.Some economists are hopeful that the job losses have now stopped, and a rebound has begun. In May, US employers added 2.5 million jobs, as states started reopening.The National Bureau of Economic Research,  a private research organisation, said it viewed the scale of the decline that started in February as more significant than its duration.""The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,"" it said.The bureau typically defines a recession as an economic contraction that lasts ""more than a few months"".It has declared 12 recessions since 1948, the longest of which was the Great Recession, which lasted 18 months, from December 2007 to June 2009.US financial markets, which tumbled in February amid signs of the economic collapse, have been on the upswing since March, due to investor hopes that economic damage will be limited, thanks to emergency relief from Congress and the central bank.On Monday, the Nasdaq index closed at 9,924.7, gaining 1.1% to top its pre-pandemic record.The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to close at 3.232.3 - returning to where it started the year - while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.7% to 27,572.4. The two indexes are now less than 10% lower than their pre-pandemic peaks.US President Donald Trump has celebrated the rebound.""Big day for Stock Market. Smart money, and the World, know that we are heading in the right direction. Jobs are coming back FAST. Next year will be our greatest ever,"" he wrote on Twitter on Monday morning.Big day for Stock Market. Smart money, and the World, know that we are heading in the right direction.

"Coronavirus: New UK travel quarantine rules a stunt, says Ryanair boss","New rules requiring all people arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days have come into effect.Those arriving by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - must give an address where they will self-isolate. Rule breakers will be fined.Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the laws were designed ""to prevent a second wave"" of coronavirus.But the boss of Ryanair has said the rules are a ""political stunt"" and are not a quarantine.Michael O'Leary told the BBC: ""You could be in Sainsbury's, you could be on the beach, you could be on the golf course in the unlikely event the Home Office calls you - all they will have is a mobile number.""He claimed even the Home Office acknowledged the rules were unenforceable.  Some industries have warned they will be severely impacted by the rules, and Mr O'Leary warned of devastation. Despite criticism from businesses, Ms Patel has said the measures are ""proportionate"" and being implemented ""at the right time"".For more on the rules click here.Almost all travellers have to fill in a ""public health passenger locator"" form on arrival. Failure to do so could lead to a penalty of £100, or travellers may be refused entry. If they are unable to provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. It says there will also be checks to see whether the rules are being followed.One airline passenger who was flying out to Germany from Stansted for work but lives in the UK, said he may have to stay overseas for longer because of the 14-day quarantine rule.He told the BBC: ""I have to consider coming back or not.""He also said the UK's quarantine rule ""makes no sense because in Germany [there is] a rate less than here and infection is more likely here in the UK than in Germany so for me it makes no sense.""Anyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man does not have to complete a form or enter quarantine.There are also exemptions for workers in some industries such as road haulage and medical professionals who are providing essential care.The union representing UK Border Force staff said the rules were complex and they were not fully prepared. Lucy Moreton, professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that technical papers explaining what to check for only arrived on Friday and were still not available to those operating on the front line. She said there 42 categories that were exempt from the quarantine rules.Ms Moreton added there was no system for checking addresses and only flagrant rule-flouters - such as using the name Mickey Mouse - would be picked up. An internal memo, seen by the BBC, told Border Force agents that the fines would not apply to passengers arriving in the UK through Ireland, who are covered by a separate set of rules.The travel industry has been vocal in its criticism of the government's quarantine rules, warning that the isolation period will deter visitors and put jobs at risk.The manufacturing industry has also highlighted that fewer flights will restrict imports and exports, which will have a knock-on effect for the freight industry, as well as hampering the recovery of some businesses.British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have written to Procurator General Sir Jonathan Jones, the government's most senior legal official - the first stage required when taking legal action against the government.The airlines say they are prepared to ask for a judicial review into the government's travel quarantine rules. Travel trade body Abta has called on the government to urgently create a roadmap for restarting international travel, while the UK's biggest airport services company, Swissport, has warned it could deliver a ""killer blow"" to the tourism sector.Industry leaders wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson in May asking that the government avoid taking a ""blanket approach"" to quarantine, suggesting so-called ""air bridges"" with countries that have low coronavirus rates.Aviation, maritime and rail industry leaders were invited to discuss the new quarantine plans but British Airways refused to attend the meeting, and aviation bosses told the BBC that they were not impressed by the content of the call. BA is proposing to make 12,000 staff redundant. Separately, Heathrow Airport's chief executive has warned that about 25,000 jobs could be at risk at Heathrow Airport. Government sources have told the BBC that the UK is hoping to secure air bridge agreements with certain countries, such as Portugal, Spain and France, as well as Australia and Singapore.But the government's position is that the idea is only ""under consideration"".In other developments:",8 June 2020,business
