Coronavirus: China to launch new airline despite travel downturn,"China's second-biggest airline is to launch a new carrier despite a severe global downturn in passengers caused by the coronavirus pandemic.China Eastern has joined forces with a range of partners including China's biggest online travel agency Trip.com.The new airline will be focused on the island destination of Hainan, home to eight million and a free-trade hub.Some have questioned the timing of the launch which comes as the airline industry struggles to survive.Government-backed China Eastern will own a majority 51% share in the new carrier, which will be called Sanya International Airlines. Other backers include Shanghai-based Juneyao Airlines and a unit of Trip.com according to an announcement made to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Sunday.No timeframe was given for the launch of the new airline, which will need regulatory approval. The partners are hoping to capitalise on Hainan's growing significance in China. The island is about 30 times the size of Hong Kong and is a popular holiday destination for Chinese tourists.  Chinese president Xi Jinping also wants to turn the island into the nation's largest free-trade zone. Beijing has outlined plans to lower the income tax rate on Hainan for selected individuals and companies to 15%, and relax visa requirements for tourists and business travellers.The launch plans come during the biggest crisis the airline industry has faced as planes are grounded and strict quarantines put in place to curb the spread of the Covid-19. Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at FlightGlobal magazine, said: ""The airline's official launch will likely depend on the continued recovery of Chinese domestic traffic and the Covid-19 situation in both China and regionally.""It takes time to build an airline, however, so a great deal of work needs to take place in terms of equipment and personnel before the airline takes to the air.""A number of high-profile airlines have been struggling to survive during the crisis including Virgin Australia, Thai Airways and Colombia's Avianca. Other airlines have been forced to layoff thousands of workers and downsize operations. The airline industry could suffer losses of more than $84bn (£66bn) this year, the International Air Transport Association, warned last week.But Shaun Rein, founder of the China Market Research Group, said it was actually a good time to start a new airline focused on Hainan. ""Even before Covid, 2020 was the year of domestic Chinese tourism as China wants to focus more on seeing their own country, especially hot spots like Hainan, Yunnan and emerging ones like Gansu.""He added that the US-China trade war has seen ""emerging patriotism with Chinese citizens wanting to show their children how great their country is and to teach them more about its heritage"". Meanwhile, ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have discouraged many Chinese travellers from visiting the former British colony.""Hainan itself as a destination is hot right now, especially as the government supports duty-free shopping there. Hainan also has no quarantine or other travel restrictions.""",15 June 2020,business
Thai Airways saved from the brink by government,"Loss-making Thai Airways has been allowed to restructure its debts to keep its planes in the sky.The struggling airline had previously asked for a government bail-out via a 58.1bn baht ($1.81bn, £1.48bn) loan.Instead, Thai officials told the airline to come up with a restructuring plan to avoid going bankrupt.The global airline industry is facing a severe financial crisis due to coronavirus travel restrictions with a growing list of casualties.Thai Airways was under financial pressure even before the coronavirus outbreak caused passenger numbers to plummet. In 2019, it reported losses of 12bn baht. But it has strongly denied rumours that it was looking to file for bankruptcy. In a statement on its website, Thai Airways said: ""it has no intention to file for bankruptcy, responding to rumours appeared in the news and online"".The airline is 51% owned by the Thai government and overseen by its State Enterprise Policy Committee (SEPC). After a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, said: ""The government has reviewed all dimensions... we have decided to petition for restructuring and not let Thai Airways go bankrupt. The airline will continue to operate.""The previous rescue package put forward by the airline involved a government guaranteed loan backed by the finance ministry.Thai Airways has around 80 planes and employs 22,000 people. It said this week it would not resume international flights until at least 30 June.The International Air Transport Association has said air travel is not expected to return to normal until 2023, putting further pressure on airlines globally.Avianca, Colombia's privately owned national flag carrier, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US earlier this month, while Virgin Australia, the second-biggest airline in Australia, entered administration in April after it failed to secure a government bailout. ",19 May 2020,business
China eases foreign travel limit after US threat,"China has said it will loosen restrictions on international air travel that were put in place to control coronavirus.The move came hours after the US pushed Beijing to allow US airlines to resume flights to the country.If the government did not act, the US said it would retaliate by barring passenger flights from China from 16 June.The dispute came amid rising tensions between the two economic giants.In recent weeks the countries have sparred over coronavirus and China's policies in Hong Kong.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Zhao Lijian said the two sides had been in close communication on the subject of air travel.""Now China has announced the policy adjustment,"" he said at a press conference. ""We hope the US will not create obstacles for resolving this issue.""Beijing in March said foreign airlines could operate no more than one weekly flight to China, adding that carriers could not exceed the level of service they were offering on 12 March. The Department of Transportation on Wednesday said the March order had effectively banned US airlines, which had voluntarily suspended service between the two countries in February due to the pandemic and Mr Trump's order barring entry to the US for most Chinese travellers.It said the refusal to grant requests to resume service this month violated the agreement governing air travel between the two countries, which dates back to 1980.""We conclude that these circumstances require the Department's action to restore a competitive balance and fair and equal opportunity among US and Chinese air carriers,"" the Department of Transportation said. ""Our overriding goal is not the perpetuation of this situation but rather an improved environment.""The order, which needs approval from US President Donald Trump to go into effect, would apply to four airlines - Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines - which have continued to fly between the two countries during the pandemic, although at reduced levels.Daniel Kliman, director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said there was some chance the two countries could resolve the matter before 16 June - but once the US ban went into effect it would be hard to undo.If it goes forward, it will hurt travel, trade and other exchange between the two countries, worsening a breakdown that was already under way, he said.""We're already seeing de-coupling of the United States and China,"" he said, pointing to US efforts to restrict technology sales and the US-China trade war. ""It's an acceleration of a trend that has really been building up.""In January, there were about 325 round-trip flights weekly between the US and China. Those have numbered around 34 since the end of March, the US said.Delta Airlines, one of the companies that had sought to resume flights this month, said it welcomed the US order.""We support and appreciate the US government's actions to enforce our rights and ensure fairness,"" it said.The US China Business Council, which represents 200 big US companies that do business in China, said: ""Commercial air travel provides a vital bridge between the US and China.  Prior to the pandemic, millions of travellers crossed the ocean each year to conduct business, enjoy holidays, study and, most important, learn about the other through direct experience.  ""This travel is especially important during times of conflict, suspicion and misunderstanding. We call on the governments of both countries to get the airplanes flying again - in both directions.""

Coronavirus: Airlines set for 'worst' year on record,"The plunge in travel caused by the coronavirus will drive airline losses of more than $84bn (£66bn) this year, a global industry group has warned.The International Air Transport Association, which has 290 member airlines, said revenues would drop to $419bn, down 50% from 2019.That is steeper than initially forecast and comes despite recent signs that travellers are returning to the skies.This year will go down as the ""worst"" on record financially, the group said.""There is no comparison,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive of the group.The group said it expected airlines to lose $230m on average each day this year as the number of travellers falls to 2.25 billion, roughly halving from last year.That will erase more than a decade of growth, returning the industry to 2006 levels.The association said the industry would see losses again next year, but the damage would drop significantly - to $15.8bn - as revenues start to rebound and passenger numbers climb back to 2014 levels. ""Provided there is not a second and more damaging wave of Covid-19, the worst of the collapse in traffic is likely behind us,"" Mr de Juniac said.IATA had previously warned that airlines would lose $314bn this year, after air traffic all but disappeared in April, when governments around the world imposed limits on travel to try to control the spread of the virus.While there are signs travel is starting to pick up, the recovery has been slow, complicated by economic downturn and government quarantines.In the US, the Transportation Security Administration screened more than 440,000 people at airport checkpoints on Sunday. That's up from fewer than 100,000 people in April, but still down more than 80% from last year.Companies have responded to the crisis by grounding fleets, scaling back service and cutting thousands of jobs. In coming months, IATA said firms are likely to lower prices in an effort to tempt back travellers, worsening their financial situation.Some airlines such as Flybe have already failed, while other have received millions in emergency government aid.Mr de Juniac said continued support is needed.""Government financial relief was and remains crucial as airlines burn through cash,"" he said.Industry groups, including IATA, have also called on the UK government to remove the 14-day quarantine on passengers entering the country.Keeping such rules in place through the end of the summer could cost the UK $186bn and 2.9 million jobs, the World Travel & Tourism Council warned on Tuesday. That is up from the 1.2 million the organisation had previously said were at risk as a result of the pandemic.""The sector's recovery risks being undermined by heavy-handed restrictions just as it emerges from one of the most punishing periods in its history - and it's not just airlines who will bear the cost but the entire travel ecosystem,"" said Gloria Guevara, the group's president.A long, long time ago, IATA forecast that global airline revenues would fall by $29bn this year. The news generated shocked headlines. Actually, that was only in late February. IATA has revised its projections a few times since then. The figure now stands at a colossal $419bn. It's a sign of just how quickly the Covid-19 pandemic developed- and how the industry went from worrying about the disruption to traffic to and within China, to grounding 95% of flights worldwide.Put simply, grounded planes aren't making money - while storing and maintaining them comes at a hefty cost.Now, air traffic is slowly picking up as countries open up again. But airlines are still collectively facing a net loss of $84bn this year - where they had been expecting a $35bn profit.It's a difference which will be measured in tens of thousands of lost jobs and livelihoods ruined.",9 June 2020,business

Bank of England 'ready to act' as economy shrinks record 20%,"Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said he will be ""ready to take action"" to help the UK economy weather the coronavirus crisis.He was speaking after figures showed that the country's economy shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - as the country spent its first full month in lockdown.""We are still very much in the midst of this,"" Mr Bailey said.But he said the figure was ""pretty much in line"" with what the bank expected.""Obviously it's a dramatic and big number, but actually it's not a surprising number,"" he said.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said April's ""historic"" fall affected virtually all areas of activity, as large parts of the economy remained shut to battle the pandemic. The contraction is three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. But analysts said April was likely to be the worst month, as the government began easing the lockdown in May.Mr Bailey said there were ""signs of the economy now beginning to come back into life"", but the big question was how much long-term damage the pandemic would cause.""That's the thing we've got to be very focused on, because that's where jobs get lost,"" he said. ""Now we hope that will be as small as possible, but we have to be ready and ready to take action, not just the Bank of England, but more broadly on what we can do to offset those longer-term and damaging effects."" The ONS also published figures for the three months from February to April, which showed a decline of 10.4% compared with the previous three-month period.News of the slump comes as almost nine million UK workers are having their wages paid by the government, while the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rocketed by 856,500 to 2.1 million in April.Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of a ""tough"" few months ahead, but added: ""We will get through it.""""We've always been in no doubt this was going to be a very serious public health crisis but also have big, big economic knock-on effects.""The UK is heavily dependent on services, we're a dynamic creative economy, we depend so much on human contact. We have been very badly hit by this."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said life would get ""a little bit more back to normal"" once High Street shops could reopen. That is set to happen on Monday in England, while shops in Northern Ireland have already been allowed to resume trading. Scotland and Wales have their own timetables for easing restrictions.In response, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds warned that the UK's economy was shrinking faster than those of other countries.She said the UK would need ""strong action to help us climb out of this as quickly as possible"".In normal times, a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the value of the goods and services it produces - increases, making its citizens on average slightly richer. However, the ONS said April's fall in GDP was the biggest the UK had ever seen. ""[The fall was] more than three times larger than last month and almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-Covid-19 fall,"" said Jonathan Athow, the agency's deputy national statistician for economic statistics.""In April, the economy was around 25% smaller than in February.""He said virtually all areas of the economy had been hit, with pubs, education, health and car sales all seeing marked falls in activity.Carmakers and housebuilders were also badly affected, although Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's highly likely April will be the low point. ""Our own surveys and wider indicators have suggested a pick-up in economy activity, but I think it's really too early to know how quickly economic activity will recover in the coming months.""In large part, thanks to the extraordinary levels of state intervention propping it up. More than one in four UK workers - some 8.9 million - are now on the government's furlough scheme that allows them to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to £2,500.The scheme has cost £19.6bn so far, while a similar programme for self-employed workers has seen 2.6 million claims made worth £7.5bn.Without these schemes, household consumption, which makes up nearly two-thirds of the UK's GDP, would have fallen even further.Sophie Lawler's 17 health clubs remain closed to their 100,000 members in the north of England and Wales. And like the rest of the fitness sector, she has no idea when she might get the green light to reopen.""The whole sector has struggled financially, and may do so for years to come,"" she said. ""The industry is shouldering quite some rental burden, costs we still incur even while we're closed.""Furloughing has been vital, she says, but she'd like the government to do more - perhaps in the form of VAT exemptions or more support for leaseholders.Despite the uncertainties, however, she thinks the sector will weather the storm. ""In terms of demand, we will do pretty well when we get through to the other side of this.""The ONS numbers add to the pressure to ease the lockdown more quickly, but fears around the control of the disease have led to a step-by-step cautious approach.There is some pressure on the Treasury to consider similar economic rescue packages to those made across Europe. Germany, for example, has cut VAT and offered billions in a package to help families with children and purchasers of green cars. France is offering huge rescue funds to the car and aerospace industry.The unprecedented jobs schemes here will help to protect livelihoods. But with this scale of hit, it will not be enough.During the global financial crisis, from the peak in February 2008 to the lowest point of March 2009, a total of 13 months, GDP shrank by 6.9%.April's unprecedented contraction is three times that - and it happened in one month. The UK's economy was already shrinking even before April. It contracted by 2% in the first three months of 2020, as just a few days of impact from the virus pushed it into decline.Economists expect an even bigger slump in the April-to-June period, plunging the country into a deep recession.""Given the lockdown started to be eased in May, April will mark the trough in GDP. So we are past the worst,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics.""But the recovery will be a drawn-out affair, as restrictions are only lifted gradually and businesses and consumers continue to exercise caution.""Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said coronavirus had caused ""unparalleled"" economic turmoil which was ""likely to scar the UK economy for some time yet"".""Having provided businesses life support, the government must now figure out how to stimulate activity,"" he added.""Waiting until later in the year to act will risk more businesses and jobs will be lost.""We don't really know yet. The UK is one of the few countries to publish monthly economic data - most others just produce quarterly and annual figures.We do know, however, that coronavirus has already pushed several major economies into recession:On Wednesday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that the UK could be the hardest hit by Covid-19 among major economies.The British economy is likely to shrink by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, it said.A recession is usually defined as two three-month periods - or quarters - of economic contraction in a row.Technically, we are not at that point yet. But the UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades.Read more ",12 June 2020,business
"Coronavirus: One million miss out on support schemes, MPs say","More than one million people have fallen through cracks in government schemes designed to support them during the coronavirus crisis, MPs says.The Treasury Select Committee called on ministers to plug gaps in the schemes to fulfil the government's promise of ""doing whatever it takes"".Freelancers and recent employees are among those who cannot access support, the MPs say.The Treasury said the schemes protected millions of jobs and livelihoods.But the committee's interim report, which was unanimously agreed by members, said it was still not enough.""The Treasury's interventions have been welcomed by many but rolling out financial support at pace and scale has inevitably resulted in some hard edges in policy design and some critical gaps in provision,"" the committee said.""The government must assist these people if it is to completely fulfil its promise to do whatever it takes to protect people from the economic impact of coronavirus.""The MPs said hundreds of thousands of people are suffering financial hardship through no fault of their own, often due to unfortunate timing in starting a new job or their employer's choice of timing in submitting payroll paperwork to the HMRC tax authority.When lockdown first started, the Treasury said it would cover up to 80% of the salaries of workers who were unable to do their job from home. But those who started a new job after the government's 28 February cut-off date are not covered by the scheme.Although this was later extended by three weeks, many have still been left behind, the committee said.The committee also said the government is failing to help those who have become self-employed within the last year and those whose companies have annual trading profits of more than £50,000.Another group that has fallen through the net is freelancers or those on short-term contracts. The MPs said that in industries such as television and theatre, where short-term contracts are the norm, many workers are not entitled to support under the schemes.The report said: ""This cannot be right. The government should give this group access to financial support that equates to 80% of their average monthly income, up to a total of £2,500 per month.""The report comes amid growing unease about the health of the economy, which contracted by a record 20.4% in April. There are warnings of huge job losses once the furlough schemes are wound down. On Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged on the Andrew Marr show ""there is going to be hardship ahead"".Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride said: ""The chancellor has said that he will do whatever it takes to support people and businesses from the economic impact of the pandemic. Overall, he has acted at impressive scale and pace.""However, the committee has identified well over a million people who, through no fault of their own, have lost livelihoods while being locked down and locked out of the main support programmes.""A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The swift and targeted action we've taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee.""Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world - with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than £6.5 billion injected into the welfare safety net.""All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.""",15 June 2020,business
"British Airways' treatment of staff 'a disgrace', say MPs","British Airways' treatment of staff during the coronavirus crisis ""is a national disgrace"", MPs have claimed.A Transport Select Committee report accuses the airline of a ""calculated attempt to take advantage"" of the pandemic by cutting thousands of jobs and downgrading terms and conditions.BA said it was doing all it could to keep ""the maximum number of jobs"".But the MPs said the airline's actions fell ""well below the standards we would expect from any employer"".The aviation industry has been one of the hardest-hit since the pandemic forced a lockdown. Airlines including EasyJet, Ryanair, and Virgin Atlantic, and suppliers Rolls-Royce and Airbus, have announced thousands of job cuts.BA plans a major restructuring, which could mean up to 12,000 redundancies and changes to the terms and conditions of remaining staff. The airline warned unions that if it could not reach an agreement over the proposals it would push through the issue by giving staff notice and offering them new contracts.That outraged the unions. Unite and the GMB are not engaging in talks with BA. Pilots' union Balpa has had discussions with the airline over the possibility of voluntary redundancies but said consultations were ""hanging by a thread"".The MPs acknowledged that job losses in the sector ""may sadly be inevitable"" due to the collapse in air travel. But it urged UK-based employers not to ""proceed hastily"" by making large numbers of people redundant while the government's furlough scheme was in place.Unions told the committee that BA had threatened a ""fire and rehire"" approach by giving redundancy notices to most of its 42,000 workers with the intention of offering jobs to a proportion of them under diminished terms and conditions. The Transport Committee found that BA had received nearly £35m from the government as of 14 May by furloughing 22,000 staff. The MPs also noted that at the end of 2019, the airline recorded profits after tax of £1.1bn and had cash reserves of £2.6bn.The committee's report said: ""The behaviour of British Airways and its parent company towards its employees is a national disgrace. It falls well below the standards we would expect from any employer, especially in [the] light of the scale of taxpayer subsidy, at this time of national crisis.""There have been calls from MPs and unions for BA to be stripped of some of its lucrative take-off and landing slots at Heathrow Airport as punishment for the treatment of its staff.Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said: ""We will continue to bring pressure where we can, including the airport slot allocation process. This wanton destruction of a loyal workforce cannot appear to go without sanction by government, parliamentarians or paying passengers, who may choose differently in future. We view it as a national disgrace.""Balpa said the committee was ""absolutely right"" about BA. Brian Strutton, the union's general secretary, said: ""Any company using the cover of Covid to slash jobs and terms and conditions like they have needs to be called out. ""I have described consultation talks between Balpa and BA as hanging by a thread due to BA's decision to issue a 'fire and rehire' threat. That remains the case.""The airline said in a statement: ""We find ourselves in the deepest crisis ever faced by the airline industry - a crisis not of our making but one which we must address.""We will do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy.""BA is already embroiled in a bitter fight with its unions and a row with the government. Now MPs have weighed in against the company as well. It's a remarkable situation for BA. It was once seen as a flag carrier for British values, a national champion, with the closest of links to the government - and a place where staff were delighted to work.So what's gone wrong? The Covid-19 crisis has scythed through the airline industry, leaving previously strong companies teetering. Carriers around the world are shedding jobs, as they prepare for a bleak few years. BA is far from unique in wanting to make deep cuts. But there's more to it than that. BA has spent the past decade trying to streamline its business, in order to compete with low-cost upstarts like Ryanair and EasyJet.That has sometimes caused conflict with its employees -  and seemingly created a legacy of mistrust and resentment, in particular among cabin crew.Now, during a crisis, those feelings are bubbling up. At times, the company looks as though it is under siege.The MPs' report also urged the government to abandon its 14-day quarantine rule at the end of June. It called for a ""more targeted and nuanced border control policy"", allowing people travelling from countries where the infection rate of Covid-19 is relatively low to enter the UK on a less restrictive basis.On Friday, BA, EasyJet and Ryanair launched legal action against the ""flawed"" quarantine policy. The airlines are asking for a judicial review to be heard ""as soon as possible"", claiming the measures introduced this week will have a ""devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy"".They said they have seen no evidence of when proposed ""air bridges"" between the UK and other countries will be implemented. Instead, they want the government to re-adopt the policy it introduced on 10 March, which required passengers from countries deemed at high risk of coronavirus infection to self-isolate on arrival in the UK.But Home Secretary Priti Patel has insisted that the policy can ""help stop a devastating second wave"" of the disease.Are you a BA staff member who has been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Wall Street stages recovery after heavy losses on Thursday,"US shares ender higher on Friday as buyers stepped in following sharp losses earlier in the day. At the closing bell, the Dow Jones was 1.9% up, while the S&P 500 rose 1.3% and the Nasdaq gained 1%, buoyed by a positive US consumer confidence survey.But, after big falls on Thursday, the three indexes still saw their biggest weekly percentage fall since mid March.In Europe on Friday, London's FTSE 100 rose 1.74%, while France's Cac 40 was up almost 2% and Germany's Dax 1.25%.Thursday's torrid trading left the Dow down 7% and Europe 5% lower. Thursday's sell-off was prompted by a bleak view of the US economy from its central bank, the Federal Reserve, and reports of rising coronavirus cases from some US states.On Friday, data from the University of Michigan showed a surprisingly big jump in confidence among consumers.Markets remain volatile as investors struggle to assess the economic damage of coronavirus.Ryan Giannotto, director of research at GraniteShares ETFs in New York, said there was no strong reason for the pick up in values: ""People are just taking a breather after the outright selling yesterday,.""There's always going to be more headlines about coronavirus cases increasing, more tests increasing. That's just something that markets, investors and companies are going to have to learn to deal with.""In the UK, David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, also said there were no strong reasons for either days' moves:""The landscape hasn't changed in the past 24 hours as there is still a possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 cases as countries reopen their economies. ""It is possible that yesterday's move was just a knee-jerk reaction to the reports of rising cases, as traders have become accustomed to falling infection rates. ""He highlighted the fact that stocks were still down since Wednesday's close.  Earlier, Asian markets reflected the downbeat trend overnight but were far less affected. IG said this highlighted the feeling that a potential second wave of coronavirus was more likely in the US or Europe.Japan's Nikkei ended down 0.75% at 22,305, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.7% to 24,301. Thursday's falls on Wall Street followed a weeks-long rally that had helped shares recover some ground from the lows seen in March.This rally was triggered by hopes that the US economy would rebound as authorities loosened restrictions put in place to try to slow the spread of the virus.Last week's surprise report showing US employers had restarted hiring in May helped to push the tech-heavy Nasdaq share index to new highs.But the recovery remains tentative. On Thursday, the US Labor Department reported that another 1.5 million people had filed new unemployment claims last week. More than 30 million continue to collect the benefits, it said.US Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday that the unemployment rate could remain above 9% at the end of the year - close to the worst level of the financial crisis, Several US states that have moved to ease lockdown restrictions, including Arizona and South Carolina, have seen an uptick in Covid-19 cases in recent days.",12 June 2020,business
'I am still the only person of colour on the team',"Employees at Ovo Energy were confused to find their company had taken part in #blackouttuesday on 2 June. The normally bright green branding on the Bristol based firm's Instagram posts had changed to a black square, alongside millions of others that day, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.  An accompanying post, made by Ovo Energy's chief executive, Stephen Fitzpatrick, said: ""The events in America this past week have appalled all of us,"" and then he pledged to improve diversity at the firm. The Instagram post prompted a reaction from staff members.One employee said on an internal communications channel: ""Thank you for showing solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement. Forums with employees were held about this last year, and we are yet to get [any] updates?""Several wondered if it might have been hypocritical for the boss to say on social media that ""starting right now, we will commit to review our hiring practices to increase our representation of black and ethnic minority colleagues"". Another employee commented: ""Oh, missed this. Would have been nice if this message had gone out to staff as well...""The company says it did provide details on its intranet alongside Mr Fitzpatrick's statement, but adds that it was sorry that some employees missed this.A further update has since been emailed to all staff with details of plans to improve diversity numbers at the firm. Ovo employees are not alone in their feelings of scepticism, and in some cases anger, towards their employer. Sweeping company statements made about the Black Lives Matter movement have been badly received by workers in various industries, for lacking communication and measurable change on an issue they feel strongly about. Two black presenters at the UK's biggest hip hop music radio station, Capital Xtra, said they were ""embarrassed"" by statements on race issued by parent company Global Radio.When women's lifestyle site Refinery29 blacked out its homepage for Black Out Tuesday last week, one former employee accused it of hypocrisy, while others described a ""toxic company culture"". The editor-in-chief later resigned.The editor-in-chief of US food magazine Bon Appetit also resigned this week after a ""brownface"" photo scandal, and amid staff allegations of a culture of racism at the magazine.Many people have taken to social media to call out perceived hypocrisy in their sector. Hashmukh Kerai, a 3D illustrator in the advertising industry in London, posted on LinkedIn: ""I've seen a lot of creative directors, agencies and studios supporting the current Black Lives Matters events. But, if you want real change, starting looking at what's happening on your doorstep.""In seven years Mr Kerai says he is yet to ""walk into an agency when I am not the only person of colour working with the team"". It is easier for him to work as a freelancer, he tells the BBC, dipping in and out of teams rather than having to fit into a culture where he feels he would never belong.  ""I work in an industry that is mostly single white males. It's still a bit like Mad Men - full of people who do not represent me,"" he says.Corey Gaskin worked as a tech reporter for Digital Trends in New York for nine months but says he was overwhelmed by what he felt was a toxic environment for women, LGBTQ people and people of colour. He left after he was disciplined for calling a company video racist. ""Publicly accusing your co-workers of being racist is not okay,"" he was told by Jeremy Kaplan, the editor-in-chief at Digital Trends, in a message seen by the BBC. Last week, when Digital Trends joined the #blackouttuesday campaign, Mr Gaskin tweeted in response a picture of the company's chief operating officer, Chris Carlson, dressed as a racial stereotype at a ""Gin and Juice"" party the company threw in its offices two years ago. Mr Gaskin's remarks on Twitter unleashed a storm of current and former employees giving their own accounts of racism and sexism in the company. The firm held a three-hour Zoom call on Wednesday to address them. Digital Trends has released a statement with an apology accompanied by a seven-step process, which includes a new zero tolerance for racism and harassment, and commitments to equitable pay and transparency. Because the action list has deadlines, a representative from the company said there would be repercussions if they were not met but was unclear what those repercussions might be.D'Wayne Edwards also posted a LinkedIn response to a Nike post to talk about the shoe company, where he used to work as the lead designer of Air Jordan. Nike spends billions of dollars in endorsements on black athletes and entertainers but could support their black consumers better by investing in black communities and hiring more black talent to work at Nike, he said in his post. When he made his start at footwear company LA Gear, Mr Edwards says he was the only black person in the building. Today, he says there are still only about 175 African American footwear designers in the industry.Mr Edwards says one of the reasons he left Nike was because the industry targeted African American kids as consumers and as brand ambassadors but did not recruit them as employees. ""It's hypocritical because our industry is sending a really twisted mixed message to the world. It says we care. They do care, but not enough to change what the internal workforce looks like,"" says Mr Edwards. He likes the promises brands have made on social media because they are opportunities to hold the firms accountable in future.  ""You were public enough to say something,"" says Mr Edwards, ""Now, I want you to tell me every month, how are you doing on those actions that you presented to the world?""This has been the very centre of the conversations he has had this week with executives from Nike, Air Jordan and Adidas. The most common question he has received was: ""What do you honestly feel we should do that is authentic?""Last week, Nike's Jordan brand said it would donate $100m (£78m) over the next 10 years to African American communities in addition to a $40m commitment announced by Nike. Mr Edwards believes educational programmes in black communities is where money should go, and has set up his own programme called Pensole, to mentor and train young black shoe designers.""I'm tired of conversation. Let's get some stuff done. We've been waiting a long time. It's time to get some stuff done.""",12 June 2020,business
"BA, Ryanair and EasyJet launch fight over 'devastating' quarantine plan","British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet have filed a formal legal challenge to the government's quarantine policy. The airlines say the policy will have ""a devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy"" and destroy thousands of jobs. They have applied for a judicial review at the High Court.The challenge claims that the quarantine rules for travellers are more stringent than those applied to people who actually have Covid-19.The new rules came into force this week. They require most inbound travellers to self isolate for 14 days, although there are more than 40 categories of incomers, largely pertaining to certain workers, who are exempt. Rules for those actually infected with the virus require self isolation for seven days.The airlines state that there was no consultation and no scientific evidence provided to support the policy; that weekly commuters from France or Germany can be exempted; and that the government is preventing people from travelling to and from countries with lower infection rates than the UK. However, the government has said the quarantine period is a ""proportionate and time-limited approach"" to protect public health.In a statement, the three airlines said they had not seen any evidence on how and when so-called ""air bridges"", allowing quarantine-free travel between the UK and other countries with low infection rates, could be implemented. They have called on the government instead to re-adopt a previous policy, where quarantine was limited to travellers from high risk countries.The air industry has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus outbreak, which has all but stopped their activities. Mass job cuts are under way: Friday's legal move marks another sign of a breakdown in relations between airlines and the UK government.Willie Walsh, the boss of IAG, which owns BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, has called the quarantine policy ""irrational"", while Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said the policy was a ""stunt"" and would not be enforceable.Industry body Airlines UK has said quarantine ""would effectively kill off air travel"".The BBC has approached the Home Office for a comment.

Coronavirus: China to launch new airline despite travel downturn,"China's second-biggest airline is to launch a new carrier despite a severe global downturn in passengers caused by the coronavirus pandemic.China Eastern has joined forces with a range of partners including China's biggest online travel agency Trip.com.The new airline will be focused on the island destination of Hainan, home to eight million and a free-trade hub.Some have questioned the timing of the launch which comes as the airline industry struggles to survive.Government-backed China Eastern will own a majority 51% share in the new carrier, which will be called Sanya International Airlines. Other backers include Shanghai-based Juneyao Airlines and a unit of Trip.com according to an announcement made to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Sunday.No timeframe was given for the launch of the new airline, which will need regulatory approval. The partners are hoping to capitalise on Hainan's growing significance in China. The island is about 30 times the size of Hong Kong and is a popular holiday destination for Chinese tourists.  Chinese president Xi Jinping also wants to turn the island into the nation's largest free-trade zone. Beijing has outlined plans to lower the income tax rate on Hainan for selected individuals and companies to 15%, and relax visa requirements for tourists and business travellers.The launch plans come during the biggest crisis the airline industry has faced as planes are grounded and strict quarantines put in place to curb the spread of the Covid-19. Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at FlightGlobal magazine, said: ""The airline's official launch will likely depend on the continued recovery of Chinese domestic traffic and the Covid-19 situation in both China and regionally.""It takes time to build an airline, however, so a great deal of work needs to take place in terms of equipment and personnel before the airline takes to the air.""A number of high-profile airlines have been struggling to survive during the crisis including Virgin Australia, Thai Airways and Colombia's Avianca. Other airlines have been forced to layoff thousands of workers and downsize operations. The airline industry could suffer losses of more than $84bn (£66bn) this year, the International Air Transport Association, warned last week.But Shaun Rein, founder of the China Market Research Group, said it was actually a good time to start a new airline focused on Hainan. ""Even before Covid, 2020 was the year of domestic Chinese tourism as China wants to focus more on seeing their own country, especially hot spots like Hainan, Yunnan and emerging ones like Gansu.""He added that the US-China trade war has seen ""emerging patriotism with Chinese citizens wanting to show their children how great their country is and to teach them more about its heritage"". Meanwhile, ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have discouraged many Chinese travellers from visiting the former British colony.""Hainan itself as a destination is hot right now, especially as the government supports duty-free shopping there. Hainan also has no quarantine or other travel restrictions.""",15 June 2020,business
Thai Airways saved from the brink by government,"Loss-making Thai Airways has been allowed to restructure its debts to keep its planes in the sky.The struggling airline had previously asked for a government bail-out via a 58.1bn baht ($1.81bn, £1.48bn) loan.Instead, Thai officials told the airline to come up with a restructuring plan to avoid going bankrupt.The global airline industry is facing a severe financial crisis due to coronavirus travel restrictions with a growing list of casualties.Thai Airways was under financial pressure even before the coronavirus outbreak caused passenger numbers to plummet. In 2019, it reported losses of 12bn baht. But it has strongly denied rumours that it was looking to file for bankruptcy. In a statement on its website, Thai Airways said: ""it has no intention to file for bankruptcy, responding to rumours appeared in the news and online"".The airline is 51% owned by the Thai government and overseen by its State Enterprise Policy Committee (SEPC). After a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, said: ""The government has reviewed all dimensions... we have decided to petition for restructuring and not let Thai Airways go bankrupt. The airline will continue to operate.""The previous rescue package put forward by the airline involved a government guaranteed loan backed by the finance ministry.Thai Airways has around 80 planes and employs 22,000 people. It said this week it would not resume international flights until at least 30 June.The International Air Transport Association has said air travel is not expected to return to normal until 2023, putting further pressure on airlines globally.Avianca, Colombia's privately owned national flag carrier, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US earlier this month, while Virgin Australia, the second-biggest airline in Australia, entered administration in April after it failed to secure a government bailout. ",19 May 2020,business
China eases foreign travel limit after US threat,"China has said it will loosen restrictions on international air travel that were put in place to control coronavirus.The move came hours after the US pushed Beijing to allow US airlines to resume flights to the country.If the government did not act, the US said it would retaliate by barring passenger flights from China from 16 June.The dispute came amid rising tensions between the two economic giants.In recent weeks the countries have sparred over coronavirus and China's policies in Hong Kong.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Zhao Lijian said the two sides had been in close communication on the subject of air travel.""Now China has announced the policy adjustment,"" he said at a press conference. ""We hope the US will not create obstacles for resolving this issue.""Beijing in March said foreign airlines could operate no more than one weekly flight to China, adding that carriers could not exceed the level of service they were offering on 12 March. The Department of Transportation on Wednesday said the March order had effectively banned US airlines, which had voluntarily suspended service between the two countries in February due to the pandemic and Mr Trump's order barring entry to the US for most Chinese travellers.It said the refusal to grant requests to resume service this month violated the agreement governing air travel between the two countries, which dates back to 1980.""We conclude that these circumstances require the Department's action to restore a competitive balance and fair and equal opportunity among US and Chinese air carriers,"" the Department of Transportation said. ""Our overriding goal is not the perpetuation of this situation but rather an improved environment.""The order, which needs approval from US President Donald Trump to go into effect, would apply to four airlines - Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines - which have continued to fly between the two countries during the pandemic, although at reduced levels.Daniel Kliman, director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said there was some chance the two countries could resolve the matter before 16 June - but once the US ban went into effect it would be hard to undo.If it goes forward, it will hurt travel, trade and other exchange between the two countries, worsening a breakdown that was already under way, he said.""We're already seeing de-coupling of the United States and China,"" he said, pointing to US efforts to restrict technology sales and the US-China trade war. ""It's an acceleration of a trend that has really been building up.""In January, there were about 325 round-trip flights weekly between the US and China. Those have numbered around 34 since the end of March, the US said.Delta Airlines, one of the companies that had sought to resume flights this month, said it welcomed the US order.""We support and appreciate the US government's actions to enforce our rights and ensure fairness,"" it said.The US China Business Council, which represents 200 big US companies that do business in China, said: ""Commercial air travel provides a vital bridge between the US and China.  Prior to the pandemic, millions of travellers crossed the ocean each year to conduct business, enjoy holidays, study and, most important, learn about the other through direct experience.  ""This travel is especially important during times of conflict, suspicion and misunderstanding. We call on the governments of both countries to get the airplanes flying again - in both directions.""

Coronavirus: Airlines set for 'worst' year on record,"The plunge in travel caused by the coronavirus will drive airline losses of more than $84bn (£66bn) this year, a global industry group has warned.The International Air Transport Association, which has 290 member airlines, said revenues would drop to $419bn, down 50% from 2019.That is steeper than initially forecast and comes despite recent signs that travellers are returning to the skies.This year will go down as the ""worst"" on record financially, the group said.""There is no comparison,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive of the group.The group said it expected airlines to lose $230m on average each day this year as the number of travellers falls to 2.25 billion, roughly halving from last year.That will erase more than a decade of growth, returning the industry to 2006 levels.The association said the industry would see losses again next year, but the damage would drop significantly - to $15.8bn - as revenues start to rebound and passenger numbers climb back to 2014 levels.

Thai Airways saved from the brink by government,"Loss-making Thai Airways has been allowed to restructure its debts to keep its planes in the sky.The struggling airline had previously asked for a government bail-out via a 58.1bn baht ($1.81bn, £1.48bn) loan.Instead, Thai officials told the airline to come up with a restructuring plan to avoid going bankrupt.The global airline industry is facing a severe financial crisis due to coronavirus travel restrictions with a growing list of casualties.Thai Airways was under financial pressure even before the coronavirus outbreak caused passenger numbers to plummet. In 2019, it reported losses of 12bn baht. But it has strongly denied rumours that it was looking to file for bankruptcy. In a statement on its website, Thai Airways said: ""it has no intention to file for bankruptcy, responding to rumours appeared in the news and online"".The airline is 51% owned by the Thai government and overseen by its State Enterprise Policy Committee (SEPC). After a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Thailand's Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, said: ""The government has reviewed all dimensions... we have decided to petition for restructuring and not let Thai Airways go bankrupt. The airline will continue to operate.""The previous rescue package put forward by the airline involved a government guaranteed loan backed by the finance ministry.Thai Airways has around 80 planes and employs 22,000 people. It said this week it would not resume international flights until at least 30 June.The International Air Transport Association has said air travel is not expected to return to normal until 2023, putting further pressure on airlines globally.Avianca, Colombia's privately owned national flag carrier, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US earlier this month, while Virgin Australia, the second-biggest airline in Australia, entered administration in April after it failed to secure a government bailout. ",19 May 2020,business
China eases foreign travel limit after US threat,"China has said it will loosen restrictions on international air travel that were put in place to control coronavirus.The move came hours after the US pushed Beijing to allow US airlines to resume flights to the country.If the government did not act, the US said it would retaliate by barring passenger flights from China from 16 June.The dispute came amid rising tensions between the two economic giants.In recent weeks the countries have sparred over coronavirus and China's policies in Hong Kong.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Zhao Lijian said the two sides had been in close communication on the subject of air travel.""Now China has announced the policy adjustment,"" he said at a press conference. ""We hope the US will not create obstacles for resolving this issue.""Beijing in March said foreign airlines could operate no more than one weekly flight to China, adding that carriers could not exceed the level of service they were offering on 12 March. The Department of Transportation on Wednesday said the March order had effectively banned US airlines, which had voluntarily suspended service between the two countries in February due to the pandemic and Mr Trump's order barring entry to the US for most Chinese travellers.It said the refusal to grant requests to resume service this month violated the agreement governing air travel between the two countries, which dates back to 1980.""We conclude that these circumstances require the Department's action to restore a competitive balance and fair and equal opportunity among US and Chinese air carriers,"" the Department of Transportation said. ""Our overriding goal is not the perpetuation of this situation but rather an improved environment.""The order, which needs approval from US President Donald Trump to go into effect, would apply to four airlines - Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Hainan Airlines - which have continued to fly between the two countries during the pandemic, although at reduced levels.Daniel Kliman, director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said there was some chance the two countries could resolve the matter before 16 June - but once the US ban went into effect it would be hard to undo.If it goes forward, it will hurt travel, trade and other exchange between the two countries, worsening a breakdown that was already under way, he said.""We're already seeing de-coupling of the United States and China,"" he said, pointing to US efforts to restrict technology sales and the US-China trade war. ""It's an acceleration of a trend that has really been building up.""In January, there were about 325 round-trip flights weekly between the US and China. Those have numbered around 34 since the end of March, the US said.Delta Airlines, one of the companies that had sought to resume flights this month, said it welcomed the US order.""We support and appreciate the US government's actions to enforce our rights and ensure fairness,"" it said.The US China Business Council, which represents 200 big US companies that do business in China, said: ""Commercial air travel provides a vital bridge between the US and China.  Prior to the pandemic, millions of travellers crossed the ocean each year to conduct business, enjoy holidays, study and, most important, learn about the other through direct experience.  ""This travel is especially important during times of conflict, suspicion and misunderstanding. We call on the governments of both countries to get the airplanes flying again - in both directions.""

Coronavirus: Airlines set for 'worst' year on record,"The plunge in travel caused by the coronavirus will drive airline losses of more than $84bn (£66bn) this year, a global industry group has warned.The International Air Transport Association, which has 290 member airlines, said revenues would drop to $419bn, down 50% from 2019.That is steeper than initially forecast and comes despite recent signs that travellers are returning to the skies.This year will go down as the ""worst"" on record financially, the group said.""There is no comparison,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive of the group.The group said it expected airlines to lose $230m on average each day this year as the number of travellers falls to 2.25 billion, roughly halving from last year.That will erase more than a decade of growth, returning the industry to 2006 levels.The association said the industry would see losses again next year, but the damage would drop significantly - to $15.8bn - as revenues start to rebound and passenger numbers climb back to 2014 levels. ""Provided there is not a second and more damaging wave of Covid-19, the worst of the collapse in traffic is likely behind us,"" Mr de Juniac said.IATA had previously warned that airlines would lose $314bn this year, after air traffic all but disappeared in April, when governments around the world imposed limits on travel to try to control the spread of the virus.While there are signs travel is starting to pick up, the recovery has been slow, complicated by economic downturn and government quarantines.In the US, the Transportation Security Administration screened more than 440,000 people at airport checkpoints on Sunday.

Bank of England 'ready to act' as economy shrinks record 20%,"Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said he will be ""ready to take action"" to help the UK economy weather the coronavirus crisis.He was speaking after figures showed that the country's economy shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - as the country spent its first full month in lockdown.""We are still very much in the midst of this,"" Mr Bailey said.But he said the figure was ""pretty much in line"" with what the bank expected.""Obviously it's a dramatic and big number, but actually it's not a surprising number,"" he said.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said April's ""historic"" fall affected virtually all areas of activity, as large parts of the economy remained shut to battle the pandemic. The contraction is three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. But analysts said April was likely to be the worst month, as the government began easing the lockdown in May.Mr Bailey said there were ""signs of the economy now beginning to come back into life"", but the big question was how much long-term damage the pandemic would cause.""That's the thing we've got to be very focused on, because that's where jobs get lost,"" he said. ""Now we hope that will be as small as possible, but we have to be ready and ready to take action, not just the Bank of England, but more broadly on what we can do to offset those longer-term and damaging effects."" The ONS also published figures for the three months from February to April, which showed a decline of 10.4% compared with the previous three-month period.News of the slump comes as almost nine million UK workers are having their wages paid by the government, while the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rocketed by 856,500 to 2.1 million in April.Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of a ""tough"" few months ahead, but added: ""We will get through it.""""We've always been in no doubt this was going to be a very serious public health crisis but also have big, big economic knock-on effects.""The UK is heavily dependent on services, we're a dynamic creative economy, we depend so much on human contact. We have been very badly hit by this."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said life would get ""a little bit more back to normal"" once High Street shops could reopen. That is set to happen on Monday in England, while shops in Northern Ireland have already been allowed to resume trading. Scotland and Wales have their own timetables for easing restrictions.In response, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds warned that the UK's economy was shrinking faster than those of other countries.She said the UK would need ""strong action to help us climb out of this as quickly as possible"".In normal times, a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the value of the goods and services it produces - increases, making its citizens on average slightly richer. However, the ONS said April's fall in GDP was the biggest the UK had ever seen. ""[The fall was] more than three times larger than last month and almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-Covid-19 fall,"" said Jonathan Athow, the agency's deputy national statistician for economic statistics.""In April, the economy was around 25% smaller than in February.""He said virtually all areas of the economy had been hit, with pubs, education, health and car sales all seeing marked falls in activity.Carmakers and housebuilders were also badly affected, although Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's highly likely April will be the low point. ""Our own surveys and wider indicators have suggested a pick-up in economy activity, but I think it's really too early to know how quickly economic activity will recover in the coming months.""In large part, thanks to the extraordinary levels of state intervention propping it up. More than one in four UK workers - some 8.9 million - are now on the government's furlough scheme that allows them to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to £2,500.The scheme has cost £19.6bn so far, while a similar programme for self-employed workers has seen 2.6 million claims made worth £7.5bn.Without these schemes, household consumption, which makes up nearly two-thirds of the UK's GDP, would have fallen even further.Sophie Lawler's 17 health clubs remain closed to their 100,000 members in the north of England and Wales. And like the rest of the fitness sector, she has no idea when she might get the green light to reopen.""The whole sector has struggled financially, and may do so for years to come,"" she said. ""The industry is shouldering quite some rental burden, costs we still incur even while we're closed.""Furloughing has been vital, she says, but she'd like the government to do more - perhaps in the form of VAT exemptions or more support for leaseholders.Despite the uncertainties, however, she thinks the sector will weather the storm. ""In terms of demand, we will do pretty well when we get through to the other side of this.""The ONS numbers add to the pressure to ease the lockdown more quickly, but fears around the control of the disease have led to a step-by-step cautious approach.There is some pressure on the Treasury to consider similar economic rescue packages to those made across Europe. Germany, for example, has cut VAT and offered billions in a package to help families with children and purchasers of green cars. France is offering huge rescue funds to the car and aerospace industry.The unprecedented jobs schemes here will help to protect livelihoods. But with this scale of hit, it will not be enough.During the global financial crisis, from the peak in February 2008 to the lowest point of March 2009, a total of 13 months, GDP shrank by 6.9%.April's unprecedented contraction is three times that - and it happened in one month. The UK's economy was already shrinking even before April. It contracted by 2% in the first three months of 2020, as just a few days of impact from the virus pushed it into decline.Economists expect an even bigger slump in the April-to-June period, plunging the country into a deep recession.""Given the lockdown started to be eased in May, April will mark the trough in GDP. So we are past the worst,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics.""But the recovery will be a drawn-out affair, as restrictions are only lifted gradually and businesses and consumers continue to exercise caution.""Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said coronavirus had caused ""unparalleled"" economic turmoil which was ""likely to scar the UK economy for some time yet"".""Having provided businesses life support, the government must now figure out how to stimulate activity,"" he added.""Waiting until later in the year to act will risk more businesses and jobs will be lost.""We don't really know yet. The UK is one of the few countries to publish monthly economic data - most others just produce quarterly and annual figures.We do know, however, that coronavirus has already pushed several major economies into recession:On Wednesday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that the UK could be the hardest hit by Covid-19 among major economies.The British economy is likely to shrink by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, it said.A recession is usually defined as two three-month periods - or quarters - of economic contraction in a row.Technically, we are not at that point yet. But the UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades.Read more ",12 June 2020,business
"Coronavirus: One million miss out on support schemes, MPs say","More than one million people have fallen through cracks in government schemes designed to support them during the coronavirus crisis, MPs says.The Treasury Select Committee called on ministers to plug gaps in the schemes to fulfil the government's promise of ""doing whatever it takes"".Freelancers and recent employees are among those who cannot access support, the MPs say.The Treasury said the schemes protected millions of jobs and livelihoods.But the committee's interim report, which was unanimously agreed by members, said it was still not enough.""The Treasury's interventions have been welcomed by many but rolling out financial support at pace and scale has inevitably resulted in some hard edges in policy design and some critical gaps in provision,"" the committee said.""The government must assist these people if it is to completely fulfil its promise to do whatever it takes to protect people from the economic impact of coronavirus.""The MPs said hundreds of thousands of people are suffering financial hardship through no fault of their own, often due to unfortunate timing in starting a new job or their employer's choice of timing in submitting payroll paperwork to the HMRC tax authority.When lockdown first started, the Treasury said it would cover up to 80% of the salaries of workers who were unable to do their job from home. But those who started a new job after the government's 28 February cut-off date are not covered by the scheme.Although this was later extended by three weeks, many have still been left behind, the committee said.The committee also said the government is failing to help those who have become self-employed within the last year and those whose companies have annual trading profits of more than £50,000.Another group that has fallen through the net is freelancers or those on short-term contracts. The MPs said that in industries such as television and theatre, where short-term contracts are the norm, many workers are not entitled to support under the schemes.The report said: ""This cannot be right. The government should give this group access to financial support that equates to 80% of their average monthly income, up to a total of £2,500 per month.""The report comes amid growing unease about the health of the economy, which contracted by a record 20.4% in April. There are warnings of huge job losses once the furlough schemes are wound down. On Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged on the Andrew Marr show ""there is going to be hardship ahead"".Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride said: ""The chancellor has said that he will do whatever it takes to support people and businesses from the economic impact of the pandemic. Overall, he has acted at impressive scale and pace.""However, the committee has identified well over a million people who, through no fault of their own, have lost livelihoods while being locked down and locked out of the main support programmes.""A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The swift and targeted action we've taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee.""Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world - with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than £6.5 billion injected into the welfare safety net.""All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.""",15 June 2020,business
"British Airways' treatment of staff 'a disgrace', say MPs","British Airways' treatment of staff during the coronavirus crisis ""is a national disgrace"", MPs have claimed.A Transport Select Committee report accuses the airline of a ""calculated attempt to take advantage"" of the pandemic by cutting thousands of jobs and downgrading terms and conditions.BA said it was doing all it could to keep ""the maximum number of jobs"".But the MPs said the airline's actions fell ""well below the standards we would expect from any employer"".The aviation industry has been one of the hardest-hit since the pandemic forced a lockdown. Airlines including EasyJet, Ryanair, and Virgin Atlantic, and suppliers Rolls-Royce and Airbus, have announced thousands of job cuts.BA plans a major restructuring, which could mean up to 12,000 redundancies and changes to the terms and conditions of remaining staff. The airline warned unions that if it could not reach an agreement over the proposals it would push through the issue by giving staff notice and offering them new contracts.That outraged the unions. Unite and the GMB are not engaging in talks with BA. Pilots' union Balpa has had discussions with the airline over the possibility of voluntary redundancies but said consultations were ""hanging by a thread"".The MPs acknowledged that job losses in the sector ""may sadly be inevitable"" due to the collapse in air travel. But it urged UK-based employers not to ""proceed hastily"" by making large numbers of people redundant while the government's furlough scheme was in place.Unions told the committee that BA had threatened a ""fire and rehire"" approach by giving redundancy notices to most of its 42,000 workers with the intention of offering jobs to a proportion of them under diminished terms and conditions. The Transport Committee found that BA had received nearly £35m from the government as of 14 May by furloughing 22,000 staff. The MPs also noted that at the end of 2019, the airline recorded profits after tax of £1.1bn and had cash reserves of £2.6bn.The committee's report said: ""The behaviour of British Airways and its parent company towards its employees is a national disgrace. It falls well below the standards we would expect from any employer, especially in [the] light of the scale of taxpayer subsidy, at this time of national crisis.""There have been calls from MPs and unions for BA to be stripped of some of its lucrative take-off and landing slots at Heathrow Airport as punishment for the treatment of its staff.Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said: ""We will continue to bring pressure where we can, including the airport slot allocation process. This wanton destruction of a loyal workforce cannot appear to go without sanction by government, parliamentarians or paying passengers, who may choose differently in future. We view it as a national disgrace.""Balpa said the committee was ""absolutely right"" about BA. Brian Strutton, the union's general secretary, said: ""Any company using the cover of Covid to slash jobs and terms and conditions like they have needs to be called out. ""I have described consultation talks between Balpa and BA as hanging by a thread due to BA's decision to issue a 'fire and rehire' threat. That remains the case.""The airline said in a statement: ""We find ourselves in the deepest crisis ever faced by the airline industry - a crisis not of our making but one which we must address.""We will do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy.""BA is already embroiled in a bitter fight with its unions and a row with the government. Now MPs have weighed in against the company as well. It's a remarkable situation for BA. It was once seen as a flag carrier for British values, a national champion, with the closest of links to the government - and a place where staff were delighted to work.So what's gone wrong? The Covid-19 crisis has scythed through the airline industry, leaving previously strong companies teetering. Carriers around the world are shedding jobs, as they prepare for a bleak few years. BA is far from unique in wanting to make deep cuts. But there's more to it than that. BA has spent the past decade trying to streamline its business, in order to compete with low-cost upstarts like Ryanair and EasyJet.That has sometimes caused conflict with its employees -  and seemingly created a legacy of mistrust and resentment, in particular among cabin crew.Now, during a crisis, those feelings are bubbling up. At times, the company looks as though it is under siege.The MPs' report also urged the government to abandon its 14-day quarantine rule at the end of June. It called for a ""more targeted and nuanced border control policy"", allowing people travelling from countries where the infection rate of Covid-19 is relatively low to enter the UK on a less restrictive basis.On Friday, BA, EasyJet and Ryanair launched legal action against the ""flawed"" quarantine policy. The airlines are asking for a judicial review to be heard ""as soon as possible"", claiming the measures introduced this week will have a ""devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy"".They said they have seen no evidence of when proposed ""air bridges"" between the UK and other countries will be implemented. Instead, they want the government to re-adopt the policy it introduced on 10 March, which required passengers from countries deemed at high risk of coronavirus infection to self-isolate on arrival in the UK.But Home Secretary Priti Patel has insisted that the policy can ""help stop a devastating second wave"" of the disease.Are you a BA staff member who has been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Thursday's sell-off was prompted by a bleak view of the US economy from its central bank, the Federal Reserve, and reports of rising coronavirus cases from some US states.On Friday, data from the University of Michigan showed a surprisingly big jump in confidence among consumers.Markets remain volatile as investors struggle to assess the economic damage of coronavirus.Ryan Giannotto, director of research at GraniteShares ETFs in New York, said there was no strong reason for the pick up in values: ""People are just taking a breather after the outright selling yesterday,.""There's always going to be more headlines about coronavirus cases increasing, more tests increasing. That's just something that markets, investors and companies are going to have to learn to deal with.""In the UK, David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, also said there were no strong reasons for either days' moves:""The landscape hasn't changed in the past 24 hours as there is still a possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 cases as countries reopen their economies. ""It is possible that yesterday's move was just a knee-jerk reaction to the reports of rising cases, as traders have become accustomed to falling infection rates.

'I am still the only person of colour on the team',"Employees at Ovo Energy were confused to find their company had taken part in #blackouttuesday on 2 June. The normally bright green branding on the Bristol based firm's Instagram posts had changed to a black square, alongside millions of others that day, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.  An accompanying post, made by Ovo Energy's chief executive, Stephen Fitzpatrick, said: ""The events in America this past week have appalled all of us,"" and then he pledged to improve diversity at the firm. The Instagram post prompted a reaction from staff members.One employee said on an internal communications channel: ""Thank you for showing solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement. Forums with employees were held about this last year, and we are yet to get [any] updates?""Several wondered if it might have been hypocritical for the boss to say on social media that ""starting right now, we will commit to review our hiring practices to increase our representation of black and ethnic minority colleagues"". Another employee commented: ""Oh, missed this. Would have been nice if this message had gone out to staff as well...""The company says it did provide details on its intranet alongside Mr Fitzpatrick's statement, but adds that it was sorry that some employees missed this.A further update has since been emailed to all staff with details of plans to improve diversity numbers at the firm. Ovo employees are not alone in their feelings of scepticism, and in some cases anger, towards their employer. Sweeping company statements made about the Black Lives Matter movement have been badly received by workers in various industries, for lacking communication and measurable change on an issue they feel strongly about. Two black presenters at the UK's biggest hip hop music radio station, Capital Xtra, said they were ""embarrassed"" by statements on race issued by parent company Global Radio.When women's lifestyle site Refinery29 blacked out its homepage for Black Out Tuesday last week, one former employee accused it of hypocrisy, while others described a ""toxic company culture"". The editor-in-chief later resigned.The editor-in-chief of US food magazine Bon Appetit also resigned this week after a ""brownface"" photo scandal, and amid staff allegations of a culture of racism at the magazine.Many people have taken to social media to call out perceived hypocrisy in their sector. Hashmukh Kerai, a 3D illustrator in the advertising industry in London, posted on LinkedIn: ""I've seen a lot of creative directors, agencies and studios supporting the current Black Lives Matters events. But, if you want real change, starting looking at what's happening on your doorstep.""In seven years Mr Kerai says he is yet to ""walk into an agency when I am not the only person of colour working with the team"". It is easier for him to work as a freelancer, he tells the BBC, dipping in and out of teams rather than having to fit into a culture where he feels he would never belong.  ""I work in an industry that is mostly single white males. It's still a bit like Mad Men - full of people who do not represent me,"" he says.Corey Gaskin worked as a tech reporter for Digital Trends in New York for nine months but says he was overwhelmed by what he felt was a toxic environment for women, LGBTQ people and people of colour. He left after he was disciplined for calling a company video racist. ""Publicly accusing your co-workers of being racist is not okay,"" he was told by Jeremy Kaplan, the editor-in-chief at Digital Trends, in a message seen by the BBC. Last week, when Digital Trends joined the #blackouttuesday campaign, Mr Gaskin tweeted in response a picture of the company's chief operating officer, Chris Carlson, dressed as a racial stereotype at a ""Gin and Juice"" party the company threw in its offices two years ago. Mr Gaskin's remarks on Twitter unleashed a storm of current and former employees giving their own accounts of racism and sexism in the company. The firm held a three-hour Zoom call on Wednesday to address them. Digital Trends has released a statement with an apology accompanied by a seven-step process, which includes a new zero tolerance for racism and harassment, and commitments to equitable pay and transparency. Because the action list has deadlines, a representative from the company said there would be repercussions if they were not met but was unclear what those repercussions might be.D'Wayne Edwards also posted a LinkedIn response to a Nike post to talk about the shoe company, where he used to work as the lead designer of Air Jordan. Nike spends billions of dollars in endorsements on black athletes and entertainers but could support their black consumers better by investing in black communities and hiring more black talent to work at Nike, he said in his post. When he made his start at footwear company LA Gear, Mr Edwards says he was the only black person in the building. Today, he says there are still only about 175 African American footwear designers in the industry.Mr Edwards says one of the reasons he left Nike was because the industry targeted African American kids as consumers and as brand ambassadors but did not recruit them as employees. ""It's hypocritical because our industry is sending a really twisted mixed message to the world. It says we care. They do care, but not enough to change what the internal workforce looks like,"" says Mr Edwards. He likes the promises brands have made on social media because they are opportunities to hold the firms accountable in future.  ""You were public enough to say something,"" says Mr Edwards, ""Now, I want you to tell me every month, how are you doing on those actions that you presented to the world?""This has been the very centre of the conversations he has had this week with executives from Nike, Air Jordan and Adidas. The most common question he has received was: ""What do you honestly feel we should do that is authentic?""Last week, Nike's Jordan brand said it would donate $100m (£78m) over the next 10 years to African American communities in addition to a $40m commitment announced by Nike. Mr Edwards believes educational programmes in black communities is where money should go, and has set up his own programme called Pensole, to mentor and train young black shoe designers.""I'm tired of conversation.

"BA, Ryanair and EasyJet launch fight over 'devastating' quarantine plan","British Airways, Ryanair and EasyJet have filed a formal legal challenge to the government's quarantine policy. The airlines say the policy will have ""a devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy"" and destroy thousands of jobs. They have applied for a judicial review at the High Court.The challenge claims that the quarantine rules for travellers are more stringent than those applied to people who actually have Covid-19.The new rules came into force this week. They require most inbound travellers to self isolate for 14 days, although there are more than 40 categories of incomers, largely pertaining to certain workers, who are exempt. Rules for those actually infected with the virus require self isolation for seven days.The airlines state that there was no consultation and no scientific evidence provided to support the policy; that weekly commuters from France or Germany can be exempted; and that the government is preventing people from travelling to and from countries with lower infection rates than the UK. However, the government has said the quarantine period is a ""proportionate and time-limited approach"" to protect public health.In a statement, the three airlines said they had not seen any evidence on how and when so-called ""air bridges"", allowing quarantine-free travel between the UK and other countries with low infection rates, could be implemented. They have called on the government instead to re-adopt a previous policy, where quarantine was limited to travellers from high risk countries.The air industry has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus outbreak, which has all but stopped their activities. Mass job cuts are under way: Friday's legal move marks another sign of a breakdown in relations between airlines and the UK government.Willie Walsh, the boss of IAG, which owns BA, Iberia and Aer Lingus, has called the quarantine policy ""irrational"", while Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said the policy was a ""stunt"" and would not be enforceable.Industry body Airlines UK has said quarantine ""would effectively kill off air travel"".The BBC has approached the Home Office for a comment.

Bank of England 'ready to act' as economy shrinks record 20%,"Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has said he will be ""ready to take action"" to help the UK economy weather the coronavirus crisis.He was speaking after figures showed that the country's economy shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - as the country spent its first full month in lockdown.""We are still very much in the midst of this,"" Mr Bailey said.But he said the figure was ""pretty much in line"" with what the bank expected.""Obviously it's a dramatic and big number, but actually it's not a surprising number,"" he said.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said April's ""historic"" fall affected virtually all areas of activity, as large parts of the economy remained shut to battle the pandemic. The contraction is three times greater than the decline seen during the whole of the 2008 to 2009 economic downturn. But analysts said April was likely to be the worst month, as the government began easing the lockdown in May.Mr Bailey said there were ""signs of the economy now beginning to come back into life"", but the big question was how much long-term damage the pandemic would cause.""That's the thing we've got to be very focused on, because that's where jobs get lost,"" he said. ""Now we hope that will be as small as possible, but we have to be ready and ready to take action, not just the Bank of England, but more broadly on what we can do to offset those longer-term and damaging effects."" The ONS also published figures for the three months from February to April, which showed a decline of 10.4% compared with the previous three-month period.News of the slump comes as almost nine million UK workers are having their wages paid by the government, while the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rocketed by 856,500 to 2.1 million in April.Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of a ""tough"" few months ahead, but added: ""We will get through it.""""We've always been in no doubt this was going to be a very serious public health crisis but also have big, big economic knock-on effects.""The UK is heavily dependent on services, we're a dynamic creative economy, we depend so much on human contact. We have been very badly hit by this."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said life would get ""a little bit more back to normal"" once High Street shops could reopen. That is set to happen on Monday in England, while shops in Northern Ireland have already been allowed to resume trading. Scotland and Wales have their own timetables for easing restrictions.In response, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds warned that the UK's economy was shrinking faster than those of other countries.She said the UK would need ""strong action to help us climb out of this as quickly as possible"".In normal times, a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the value of the goods and services it produces - increases, making its citizens on average slightly richer. However, the ONS said April's fall in GDP was the biggest the UK had ever seen. ""[The fall was] more than three times larger than last month and almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-Covid-19 fall,"" said Jonathan Athow, the agency's deputy national statistician for economic statistics.""In April, the economy was around 25% smaller than in February.""He said virtually all areas of the economy had been hit, with pubs, education, health and car sales all seeing marked falls in activity.Carmakers and housebuilders were also badly affected, although Mr Athow told the BBC's Today programme: ""It's highly likely April will be the low point. ""Our own surveys and wider indicators have suggested a pick-up in economy activity, but I think it's really too early to know how quickly economic activity will recover in the coming months.""In large part, thanks to the extraordinary levels of state intervention propping it up. More than one in four UK workers - some 8.9 million - are now on the government's furlough scheme that allows them to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to £2,500.The scheme has cost £19.6bn so far, while a similar programme for self-employed workers has seen 2.6 million claims made worth £7.5bn.Without these schemes, household consumption, which makes up nearly two-thirds of the UK's GDP, would have fallen even further.Sophie Lawler's 17 health clubs remain closed to their 100,000 members in the north of England and Wales. And like the rest of the fitness sector, she has no idea when she might get the green light to reopen.""The whole sector has struggled financially, and may do so for years to come,"" she said. ""The industry is shouldering quite some rental burden, costs we still incur even while we're closed.""Furloughing has been vital, she says, but she'd like the government to do more - perhaps in the form of VAT exemptions or more support for leaseholders.Despite the uncertainties, however, she thinks the sector will weather the storm. ""In terms of demand, we will do pretty well when we get through to the other side of this.""The ONS numbers add to the pressure to ease the lockdown more quickly, but fears around the control of the disease have led to a step-by-step cautious approach.There is some pressure on the Treasury to consider similar economic rescue packages to those made across Europe. Germany, for example, has cut VAT and offered billions in a package to help families with children and purchasers of green cars. France is offering huge rescue funds to the car and aerospace industry.The unprecedented jobs schemes here will help to protect livelihoods. But with this scale of hit, it will not be enough.During the global financial crisis, from the peak in February 2008 to the lowest point of March 2009, a total of 13 months, GDP shrank by 6.9%.April's unprecedented contraction is three times that - and it happened in one month. The UK's economy was already shrinking even before April. It contracted by 2% in the first three months of 2020, as just a few days of impact from the virus pushed it into decline.Economists expect an even bigger slump in the April-to-June period, plunging the country into a deep recession.""Given the lockdown started to be eased in May, April will mark the trough in GDP. So we are past the worst,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics.""But the recovery will be a drawn-out affair, as restrictions are only lifted gradually and businesses and consumers continue to exercise caution.""Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said coronavirus had caused ""unparalleled"" economic turmoil which was ""likely to scar the UK economy for some time yet"".""Having provided businesses life support, the government must now figure out how to stimulate activity,"" he added.""Waiting until later in the year to act will risk more businesses and jobs will be lost.""We don't really know yet. The UK is one of the few countries to publish monthly economic data - most others just produce quarterly and annual figures.We do know, however, that coronavirus has already pushed several major economies into recession:On Wednesday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that the UK could be the hardest hit by Covid-19 among major economies.The British economy is likely to shrink by 11.5% in 2020, slightly outstripping falls in countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy, it said.A recession is usually defined as two three-month periods - or quarters - of economic contraction in a row.Technically, we are not at that point yet. But the UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades.Read more ",12 June 2020,business
"Coronavirus: One million miss out on support schemes, MPs say","More than one million people have fallen through cracks in government schemes designed to support them during the coronavirus crisis, MPs says.The Treasury Select Committee called on ministers to plug gaps in the schemes to fulfil the government's promise of ""doing whatever it takes"".Freelancers and recent employees are among those who cannot access support, the MPs say.The Treasury said the schemes protected millions of jobs and livelihoods.But the committee's interim report, which was unanimously agreed by members, said it was still not enough.""The Treasury's interventions have been welcomed by many but rolling out financial support at pace and scale has inevitably resulted in some hard edges in policy design and some critical gaps in provision,"" the committee said.""The government must assist these people if it is to completely fulfil its promise to do whatever it takes to protect people from the economic impact of coronavirus.""The MPs said hundreds of thousands of people are suffering financial hardship through no fault of their own, often due to unfortunate timing in starting a new job or their employer's choice of timing in submitting payroll paperwork to the HMRC tax authority.When lockdown first started, the Treasury said it would cover up to 80% of the salaries of workers who were unable to do their job from home. But those who started a new job after the government's 28 February cut-off date are not covered by the scheme.Although this was later extended by three weeks, many have still been left behind, the committee said.The committee also said the government is failing to help those who have become self-employed within the last year and those whose companies have annual trading profits of more than £50,000.Another group that has fallen through the net is freelancers or those on short-term contracts. The MPs said that in industries such as television and theatre, where short-term contracts are the norm, many workers are not entitled to support under the schemes.The report said: ""This cannot be right. The government should give this group access to financial support that equates to 80% of their average monthly income, up to a total of £2,500 per month.""The report comes amid growing unease about the health of the economy, which contracted by a record 20.4% in April. There are warnings of huge job losses once the furlough schemes are wound down. On Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged on the Andrew Marr show ""there is going to be hardship ahead"".Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride said: ""The chancellor has said that he will do whatever it takes to support people and businesses from the economic impact of the pandemic. Overall, he has acted at impressive scale and pace.""However, the committee has identified well over a million people who, through no fault of their own, have lost livelihoods while being locked down and locked out of the main support programmes.""A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The swift and targeted action we've taken has protected millions of jobs and livelihoods and our interventions have been rightly welcomed by the select committee.""Our wide-ranging support package is one of the most comprehensive in the world - with generous income support schemes, billions paid in loans and grants, tax deferrals and more than £6.5 billion injected into the welfare safety net.""All our support is targeted to make sure we use public funds responsibly, helping those who need it most as quickly as possible, while minimising fraud risk.""",15 June 2020,business
"British Airways' treatment of staff 'a disgrace', say MPs","British Airways' treatment of staff during the coronavirus crisis ""is a national disgrace"", MPs have claimed.A Transport Select Committee report accuses the airline of a ""calculated attempt to take advantage"" of the pandemic by cutting thousands of jobs and downgrading terms and conditions.BA said it was doing all it could to keep ""the maximum number of jobs"".But the MPs said the airline's actions fell ""well below the standards we would expect from any employer"".The aviation industry has been one of the hardest-hit since the pandemic forced a lockdown. Airlines including EasyJet, Ryanair, and Virgin Atlantic, and suppliers Rolls-Royce and Airbus, have announced thousands of job cuts.BA plans a major restructuring, which could mean up to 12,000 redundancies and changes to the terms and conditions of remaining staff. The airline warned unions that if it could not reach an agreement over the proposals it would push through the issue by giving staff notice and offering them new contracts.That outraged the unions. Unite and the GMB are not engaging in talks with BA. Pilots' union Balpa has had discussions with the airline over the possibility of voluntary redundancies but said consultations were ""hanging by a thread"".The MPs acknowledged that job losses in the sector ""may sadly be inevitable"" due to the collapse in air travel. But it urged UK-based employers not to ""proceed hastily"" by making large numbers of people redundant while the government's furlough scheme was in place.Unions told the committee that BA had threatened a ""fire and rehire"" approach by giving redundancy notices to most of its 42,000 workers with the intention of offering jobs to a proportion of them under diminished terms and conditions. The Transport Committee found that BA had received nearly £35m from the government as of 14 May by furloughing 22,000 staff. The MPs also noted that at the end of 2019, the airline recorded profits after tax of £1.1bn and had cash reserves of £2.6bn.The committee's report said: ""The behaviour of British Airways and its parent company towards its employees is a national disgrace. It falls well below the standards we would expect from any employer, especially in [the] light of the scale of taxpayer subsidy, at this time of national crisis.""There have been calls from MPs and unions for BA to be stripped of some of its lucrative take-off and landing slots at Heathrow Airport as punishment for the treatment of its staff.Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said: ""We will continue to bring pressure where we can, including the airport slot allocation process. This wanton destruction of a loyal workforce cannot appear to go without sanction by government, parliamentarians or paying passengers, who may choose differently in future. We view it as a national disgrace.""Balpa said the committee was ""absolutely right"" about BA. Brian Strutton, the union's general secretary, said: ""Any company using the cover of Covid to slash jobs and terms and conditions like they have needs to be called out. ""I have described consultation talks between Balpa and BA as hanging by a thread due to BA's decision to issue a 'fire and rehire' threat. That remains the case.""The airline said in a statement: ""We find ourselves in the deepest crisis ever faced by the airline industry - a crisis not of our making but one which we must address.""We will do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy.""BA is already embroiled in a bitter fight with its unions and a row with the government. Now MPs have weighed in against the company as well. It's a remarkable situation for BA. It was once seen as a flag carrier for British values, a national champion, with the closest of links to the government - and a place where staff were delighted to work.So what's gone wrong? The Covid-19 crisis has scythed through the airline industry, leaving previously strong companies teetering. Carriers around the world are shedding jobs, as they prepare for a bleak few years. BA is far from unique in wanting to make deep cuts. But there's more to it than that. BA has spent the past decade trying to streamline its business, in order to compete with low-cost upstarts like Ryanair and EasyJet.That has sometimes caused conflict with its employees -  and seemingly created a legacy of mistrust and resentment, in particular among cabin crew.Now, during a crisis, those feelings are bubbling up. At times, the company looks as though it is under siege.The MPs' report also urged the government to abandon its 14-day quarantine rule at the end of June. It called for a ""more targeted and nuanced border control policy"", allowing people travelling from countries where the infection rate of Covid-19 is relatively low to enter the UK on a less restrictive basis.On Friday, BA, EasyJet and Ryanair launched legal action against the ""flawed"" quarantine policy. The airlines are asking for a judicial review to be heard ""as soon as possible"", claiming the measures introduced this week will have a ""devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy"".They said they have seen no evidence of when proposed ""air bridges"" between the UK and other countries will be implemented. Instead, they want the government to re-adopt the policy it introduced on 10 March, which required passengers from countries deemed at high risk of coronavirus infection to self-isolate on arrival in the UK.But Home Secretary Priti Patel has insisted that the policy can ""help stop a devastating second wave"" of the disease.Are you a BA staff member who has been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Wall Street stages recovery after heavy losses on Thursday,"US shares ender higher on Friday as buyers stepped in following sharp losses earlier in the day. At the closing bell, the Dow Jones was 1.9% up, while the S&P 500 rose 1.3% and the Nasdaq gained 1%, buoyed by a positive US consumer confidence survey.But, after big falls on Thursday, the three indexes still saw their biggest weekly percentage fall since mid March.In Europe on Friday, London's FTSE 100 rose 1.74%, while France's Cac 40 was up almost 2% and Germany's Dax 1.25%.Thursday's torrid trading left the Dow down 7% and Europe 5% lower. Thursday's sell-off was prompted by a bleak view of the US economy from its central bank, the Federal Reserve, and reports of rising coronavirus cases from some US states.On Friday, data from the University of Michigan showed a surprisingly big jump in confidence among consumers.Markets remain volatile as investors struggle to assess the economic damage of coronavirus.Ryan Giannotto, director of research at GraniteShares ETFs in New York, said there was no strong reason for the pick up in values: ""People are just taking a breather after the outright selling yesterday,.""There's always going to be more headlines about coronavirus cases increasing, more tests increasing. That's just something that markets, investors and companies are going to have to learn to deal with.""In the UK, David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets, also said there were no strong reasons for either days' moves:""The landscape hasn't changed in the past 24 hours as there is still a possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 cases as countries reopen their economies. ""It is possible that yesterday's move was just a knee-jerk reaction to the reports of rising cases, as traders have become accustomed to falling infection rates. ""He highlighted the fact that stocks were still down since Wednesday's close.  Earlier, Asian markets reflected the downbeat trend overnight but were far less affected. IG said this highlighted the feeling that a potential second wave of coronavirus was more likely in the US or Europe.Japan's Nikkei ended down 0.75% at 22,305, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.7% to 24,301. Thursday's falls on Wall Street followed a weeks-long rally that had helped shares recover some ground from the lows seen in March.This rally was triggered by hopes that the US economy would rebound as authorities loosened restrictions put in place to try to slow the spread of the virus.Last week's surprise report showing US employers had restarted hiring in May helped to push the tech-heavy Nasdaq share index to new highs.But the recovery remains tentative. On Thursday, the US Labor Department reported that another 1.5 million people had filed new unemployment claims last week. More than 30 million continue to collect the benefits, it said.US Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday that the unemployment rate could remain above 9% at the end of the year - close to the worst level of the financial crisis, Several US states that have moved to ease lockdown restrictions, including Arizona and South Carolina, have seen an uptick in Covid-19 cases in recent days.",12 June 2020,business
'I am still the only person of colour on the team',"Employees at Ovo Energy were confused to find their company had taken part in #blackouttuesday on 2 June. The normally bright green branding on the Bristol based firm's Instagram posts had changed to a black square, alongside millions of others that day, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.  An accompanying post, made by Ovo Energy's chief executive, Stephen Fitzpatrick, said: ""The events in America this past week have appalled all of us,"" and then he pledged to improve diversity at the firm. The Instagram post prompted a reaction from staff members.One employee said on an internal communications channel: ""Thank you for showing solidarity with the blacklivesmatter movement. Forums with employees were held about this last year, and we are yet to get [any] updates?""Several wondered if it might have been hypocritical for the boss to say on social media that ""starting right now, we will commit to review our hiring practices to increase our representation of black and ethnic minority colleagues"". Another employee commented: ""Oh, missed this. Would have been nice if this message had gone out to staff as well...""The company says it did provide details on its intranet alongside Mr Fitzpatrick's statement, but adds that it was sorry that some employees missed this.A further update has since been emailed to all staff with details of plans to improve diversity numbers at the firm. Ovo employees are not alone in their feelings of scepticism, and in some cases anger, towards their employer. Sweeping company statements made about the Black Lives Matter movement have been badly received by workers in various industries, for lacking communication and measurable change on an issue they feel strongly about. Two black presenters at the UK's biggest hip hop music radio station, Capital Xtra, said they were ""embarrassed"" by statements on race issued by parent company Global Radio.When women's lifestyle site Refinery29 blacked out its homepage for Black Out Tuesday last week, one former employee accused it of hypocrisy, while others described a ""toxic company culture"". The editor-in-chief later resigned.The editor-in-chief of US food magazine Bon Appetit also resigned this week after a ""brownface"" photo scandal, and amid staff allegations of a culture of racism at the magazine.Many people have taken to social media to call out perceived hypocrisy in their sector. Hashmukh Kerai, a 3D illustrator in the advertising industry in London, posted on LinkedIn: ""I've seen a lot of creative directors, agencies and studios supporting the current Black Lives Matters events. But, if you want real change, starting looking at what's happening on your doorstep.""In seven years Mr Kerai says he is yet to ""walk into an agency when I am not the only person of colour working with the team"". It is easier for him to work as a freelancer, he tells the BBC, dipping in and out of teams rather than having to fit into a culture where he feels he would never belong.  ""I work in an industry that is mostly single white males. It's still a bit like Mad Men - full of people who do not represent me,"" he says.Corey Gaskin worked as a tech reporter for Digital Trends in New York for nine months but says he was overwhelmed by what he felt was a toxic environment for women, LGBTQ people and people of colour. He left after he was disciplined for calling a company video racist. ""Publicly accusing your co-workers of being racist is not okay,"" he was told by Jeremy Kaplan, the editor-in-chief at Digital Trends, in a message seen by the BBC. Last week, when Digital Trends joined the #blackouttuesday campaign, Mr Gaskin tweeted in response a picture of the company's chief operating officer, Chris Carlson, dressed as a racial stereotype at a ""Gin and Juice"" party the company threw in its offices two years ago. Mr Gaskin's remarks on Twitter unleashed a storm of current and former employees giving their own accounts of racism and sexism in the company. The firm held a three-hour Zoom call on Wednesday to address them. Digital Trends has released a statement with an apology accompanied by a seven-step process, which includes a new zero tolerance for racism and harassment, and commitments to equitable pay and transparency.

Coronavirus: Three firms still positive despite the virus crisis,"The scale of the UK's economic troubles have been laid bare by the latest GDP figures. Will the recovery be V-shaped, L-shaped, U-shaped, or is it far too early to tell?Despite the uncertainties, however, some British companies are nothing if not positive.Here, the owners of three firms that went into lockdown in March tell the BBC why they can see light at the end of the tunnel.The lockdown hit just as Little Moons was enjoying its best month of trading.The business, which makes the Japanese ice cream confection mochi for restaurants and supermarkets, shut down overnight.Co-founder Vivien Wong said lockdown didn't come as a great surprise. ""We'd followed what was happening in China and Hong Kong,"" she said. More than 50% of revenues came from restaurants, money that dried up immediately. ""We were weren't sure what was going to happen with supermarkets, but we knew immediately we had to go into cash preservation mode.""Luckily, Little Moons struck a deal with its landlord, which eased cash flow. ""We cancelled marketing and all unnecessary spending. Basically, we just hunkered down,"" Ms Wong said.The London-based company trades throughout Europe, which has helped Little Moons to get back to business.Ms Wong said: ""Europe opened up a little earlier, so from about mid-May we started getting orders from supermarkets.""We started un-furloughing a few members of our team, and have just started cranking up production again.""But a return to the record trading Little Moons saw in March could be a long way off. Ms Wong said: ""We have halved the number of people on the production floor and changed shift patterns. ""It means we are not as efficient as before. That's really affected us financially."" Little Moons is employing more cleaners, and the cost of face masks and other food hygiene equipment has soared.The firm's future is tied up with the restaurant sector, which she worries may never fully recover. That said, supermarket orders are rising, which Ms Wong puts down to people wanting comfort food.""It was pretty catastrophic"" is how Adam Redhouse describes the first few days of lockdown. Sales and lettings at his London estate agents firm disappeared virtually overnight.""We furloughed sales staff immediately, and closed all the offices,"" he said. ""We lost over 50% of the sales pipeline over the first few days as people cancelled.""And yet, over the following weeks the business continued to get what Mr Redhouse said were ""a fair few inquiries. That was a massive surprise. But if you can't do viewings, you can't sell properties.""Still, even though Squire Estates did very few transactions, the continuing customer interest at least gave him hope that business would pick up once the lockdown eased.It was only in mid-May that estate agents began re-opening for business, but Mr Redhouse has been amazed at the pace of recovery. ""It sounds crazy, given how much business we lost,"" he said. ""It was on a Tuesday night that the government said we could re-open, and on the Wednesday morning we un-furloughed all the sales staff. There was a lot of pent up demand for transactions and viewings,"" he said.It helped, Mr Redhouse believes, that he and his partner made a special effort to keep in touch with clients and potential clients during the lockdown. Business continues to pick up, but will it get back to normal? ""I like to think so. The amount of demand that we are seeing shows that people want to move. I feel positive,"" he said.Sophie Lawler's 17 health clubs remain closed to their 100,000 members in the north of England and Wales. And like the rest of the fitness sector, she has no idea when she might get the green light to re-open.""The whole sector has struggled financially, and may do so for years to come,"" she said. ""The industry is shouldering quite some rental burden, costs we still incur even while we're closed.""Furloughing has been vital. ""It's given us a great deal of oxygen to keep the business going,"" she said.Staff wages are the biggest fixed costs after property rents and rates. As soon as Total Fitness is given the go-ahead to re-open Ms Lawler plans to bring all the staff back from furlough. ""We will need all our people, maybe even more.""She'd like to see the government do more to help, perhaps with some VAT exemptions and support for landlords to let them ease the burden on leaseholders. Despite the uncertainties, however, she says the fitness industry ""has an exceptionally bright future if we can weather this storm"". Ms Lawler said the sector has proved particularly resilient to recessions in the past, and will do so again. She expects to see a uptick in customers who recognise the importance of fitness and exercise in the fight to stay healthy against viruses.""It terms of demand, we will do pretty well when we get through to the other side of this,"" she said. The trouble is, she has no idea when that might be. ""Our single biggest challenge is that there is just no guidance on re-opening.""",12 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: What is a recession?,"The UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades. So what exactly does that mean? In normal times, a country's economy grows. Its citizens, on average, get slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases.But sometimes the value of goods and services produced falls.A recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row.If a recession carries on for a long time, or is particularly bad, it is known as a depression.For most people, economic growth is a good thing. It usually means there are more jobs to go round. Companies are generally more profitable and can afford to pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also means the government gets more money in taxes. So it has room to cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and the wages of government workers.When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse.Most of the developed world saw negative growth - or falling GDP - for January to March 2020, as the economic impact of coronavirus began to hit. The official figures for April to June haven't been published yet, but they are likely to show even bigger falls. This would mean a second quarter of negative growth, confirming that much of the world is in recession.In the UK, the economy shrank by 2% from January to March, according to the Office for National Statistics. It then shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - in its first full month in lockdown.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts huge falls in GDP for 2020 as a whole - an extraordinary fall of 5.9% for the US and 6.5% for the UK.In fact the IMF estimates the entire world economy will shrink by 3% this year, making it the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to secure new opportunities and promotions. Graduates and school leavers looking for their first job could find fewer openings available. Those staying in work may miss out on pay rises - or have to work longer hours or accept pay cuts.The UK government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), suggested the unemployment rate could more than double, to 10% this summer.It also estimates that the government might have to borrow more than £300bn to cover the cost of the crisis.However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many people in the UK who owned houses with mortgages and kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. The Bank of England cut interest rates to support the economy, which reduced mortgage interest payments for many considerably, leaving them with more money to spend.Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well.In the UK the last recession, caused by the global financial crisis, lasted five quarters - from the second quarter of 2008 onwards. GDP fell by an estimated 7.2% over the whole period.Unemployment rose sharply, but it began to fall back again two years later. And there was a massive deficit - the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends on public services.This resulted in a near-doubling of the national debt, and a decade-long programme of austerity.There were steep cuts in many areas of government spending, except health, education and international aid.The IMF predicts the recession will be over next year and the world economy will start bouncing back. But we are in uncharted territory, and no-one knows how strong that recovery will be.If all the businesses which shut during the pandemic and lockdown could open quickly, the consequences of the recession would be less severe. However, there are fears over whether the virus will start spreading again, and people may be wary of travelling or going out even if they're told it's safe. Cruises, air travel and business conferences in particular could take years to bounce back.So the consequences of this recession will be felt for years to come.A reliable way of controlling Covid-19, such as a vaccine, would help create a strong recovery.But until that is found, there are a few remedies available. In the last recession, central banks cut interest rates to support the economy. That meant people and businesses could borrow more easily, and had more to spend.But interest rates are already close to zero in many places, and it may not be possible to cut them much further.Governments around the world are already borrowing huge sums to support their economies through tax cuts and higher public spending - such as furlough schemes, support for businesses, and even direct cash payments to citizens. But that borrowing comes at a cost, which will be felt for decades to come. ",12 June 2020,business
The hidden detectors looking for guns and knives,"Peter George calls it the protection paradox. People want to have safety, but they don't want to spend a long time queuing for a security inspection.He is the chief executive of Evolv Technology, a US business based just outside Boston that is developing systems to search for firearms at major public events, and perhaps one day look for symptoms of Covid-19.Evolv has been asked if it can build arches into doorways and the company is examining ways to widen the space between sensors to allow larger crowds to go through more quickly. Mr George has a background in cybersecurity work that he says qualifies him for finding needles in haystacks. Evolv sells security arches that contain a combination of electronic surveillance and AI software to sift through signals and spot one gun-toting individual among thousands of people filing into a rock concert. This discreet technology was used to screen VIPs at this year's Brit Awards at London's O2 centre.Traditional metal detectors throw up a lot of alarms for innocent metallic objects, creating a chokepoint for paying customers who just want to get to their seat in a stadium or concert hall. This very high alarm rate prompted Evolv to blend AI software with radar to cut down on false alerts and keep the crowds flowing into a venue without irksome interruptions. This is not just looking for the shape of a gun as defined by the software, but also for small shards of metal packed into a confined space to create shrapnel around an explosive device as was tragically demonstrated in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.Evolv's software engineers have written algorithms that interpret shapes as signatures, with the outlines of knives and guns catalogued as reasons to alert an operator. The density of metal is one key indicator of a weapon's presence and Mr George says his colleagues have programmed the system to react in 1/38th of a second. The AI software analyses the results it gets from each crowd and this is uploaded automatically into Evolv's own database.Every arch sold is plumbed into Evolv's home archive via the internet. So it gets updated from other scanners. The system evolves as the user base grows, or as Mr George puts it, ""we can make everybody smarter as we share the data we collect."" Evolv hopes to add thermal imaging capabilities to its scanners in the course of 2020. In theory that could detect people with high temperatures, one of the symptoms of Covid-19.Dr Simon Worrell is an immunologist specialising in pandemic planning who works for health and security advice firm Collinson. He says the use of AI to assess human scans ""sounds good, but I just don't know how effective it will be"".Taking paracetamol, for example, will lower the temperature of a Covid-19 carrier. And basic precautions are still paramount. ""Physical distancing is important.""He thinks that adhering to layers of protection, temperature checks, masks and staying apart, is the way to beat the virus.   Canadian threat protection specialist Patriot One Technologies has directed its AI team to research how its existing systems, built to identify one person carrying a gun in a crowd, can be tuned to pick up people with raised temperatures. But Martin Cronin, chief executive of Patriot One and a former British Foreign Office diplomat, urges caution. ""It's not that easy to detect temperatures. You can't just point a thermal camera at a crowd. Factors like the ambient temperature or whether someone has a raised temperature due to exercise can undermine the accuracy of scanning devices. People should be wary of bold claims to have answers to temperature scanning.""Part of the challenge is tuning AI software to ignore such distractions and isolate the indicators that are important to keeping virus carriers out of crowded places. Patriot One wants to pin down a range of anomalies, including the absence of approved face masks, that mean a visitor merits further attention.  It's been difficult enough training the systems to look for concealed weapons.Patriot One found that radar did a fine job of peeking underneath coats and jackets to find what it thought were weapons. Unfortunately the number of false alerts was unreasonably high. AI was drafted in to help, in the form of machine-learning technology that could sort out the shapes caught on the radar scan and assess whether they really represented a threat. With a boost from AI the success rate rose, but it still wasn't up to a stage where it could be unleashed on the public without common objects getting confused with the tools of a terrorist. The system was only working well in some environments, while in others the signals became cluttered by outside elements such as emissions from consumer electronics. More Technology of BusinessThe answer was yet more technology. Patriot One bought several companies, with additional AI and detection expertise.Video images of guns and knives were fed into the AI software teaching it to discriminate between different objects. And the company has connected its surveillance technology to security cameras suspended in familiar transparent bulges from corridor ceilings in customer sites.Mr Cronin brought the AI ingredients together, pooling the data from different systems. He likens it to the way humans combine all of their senses to understand the world around them. He claims the AI software has now eliminated interference from building noise and electronic signals, deleting the false positives that dogged early trials. And he presents the technology as leaving individuals anonymous. ""We look for objects, not people."" But the algorithms that underpin smart systems can be foxed by mundane events.At one high school campus in the US a gun detection scanner was perplexed by the sudden appearance of umbrellas on a day of heavy rain. Retrained to identify an umbrella as a non-threatening object the software could then be updated across Patriot One's user network. Different societies throw up different problems. In North America the priority is to detect guns. For prospective UK users the system may be looking for knives. But in both cases the idea is to install unobtrusive security architecture. So the next time you stroll into a corporate reception area or the entrance of a public building, cast a glance at those big planters that frame the door as you walk in. You might just have been checked out for weapons. Or perhaps, one day, a virus. ",12 June 2020,business
Coronavirus may have huge impact on property markets,"The saying ""there is no place like home"" is perhaps not so heart-warming a thought these days.After all, most of us have been locked down in our house or apartment for a very long time.The coronavirus pandemic will, however, do more than change the way we might feel about our homes. It has the potential to have a huge impact on property markets around the world. It is fairly clear that with massive unemployment, wage cuts, business failures, and job uncertainty, many people are likely to be cautious about making the biggest investment of their lives - buying a home.Normally that leads to falling house prices, and during the last recession and credit crunch that is what we saw in the UK, US and many other countries.In the UK, the Nationwide house price index for May showed that prices fell 1.7% from the previous month, the largest decline for 11 years.But as Robert Gardner, the Nationwide's chief economist, points out, ""there are some signs this is starting to stabilise"". He adds that this is because the current situation is not a typical economic downturn.Instead, the UK government - like others around the world - consciously decided to put much of the economy on hold. This was at the same time as putting in place a host of measures to support households and businesses, such as the worker furloughing scheme.The hope, therefore, is that as lockdown restrictions continue to be lifted, economies and housing markets will rebound. In the US, house prices are still rising. ""Many areas [of the country] have put a moratorium on evictions, normally for 60 to 90 days, but in some areas for six months,"" says Prof Nori Gerardo Lietz, who teaches real estate investment at Harvard Business School.This means that the immediate problems have been pushed on to landlords and the banks, which isn't to say that there won't be trouble further down the line. Especially as the US unemployment rate remains sky high since the coronavirus lockdown - 13.3% in May, albeit down from 14.7% in April.However, behind those headline figures, there are other forces at work on the property sector. Many of us have suddenly realised that we can work from home and avoid the commute and the office, and this is already having an influence on the market. Rightmove, the UK property website, has reported a significant rise in the number of people searching for homes further from town and city centres, with larger gardens and space for a home office. This may not be a permanent change, but coronavirus is certainly making many people think about how and where they work and live. For the commercial property sector, the changes are far more dramatic, especially on the UK's High Streets. ""Retail [in the UK] has had problems for ages,"" says Prof Michael White, an expert in real estate economics, at Nottingham Trent University. ""And at the moment incomes are obviously being hit by furloughs, and then there will be a squeeze on spending in a recession.""It means an acceleration of what we saw before the virus struck - many High Streets have been decaying for years. And now that many more of us have discovered how much we can buy online that is only going to increase in speed.An added issue is that before coronavirus, the trend was already towards fewer shops on the High Street, and more services - things you can't get online - such as cafes, hairdressers and beauticians. ""The twist is that these services have been hit, so we have seen a slowing down of a growing trend,"" says Prof Andrew Baum, who leads the Future of Real Estate Initiative at Oxford University's Said Business School.This means that High Streets have been hit twice as hard - many stores are shut and face-to-face service suppliers have almost totally closed. The result has been a rise in rent arrears. If this is just a matter of landlords missing or deferring one or two quarters of rents, that is not a massive problem for the industry.But if this is the start of a long-term trend then that will cause problems, and possibly a knock-on fall in the capital value of many retail properties, possibly by 20%-30% believes Prof Baum. In the US, where there has been a similar trend in the retail sector, the problem is slightly different. As land is so cheap, and planning permission so easy to get, there is a long tradition of retail parks and malls just being abandoned if they are not making money, or cost too much to upgrade. The impact of coronavirus could see this trend increase.""The problem with US retail is not that it's over built, but that it is under demolished,"" says Prof Gerardo Lietz.For providers of office space, if coronavirus turns out to be a one-off hit, with just two quarters of rents deferred, there is little reason for property values to be affected at all.But instead, coronavirus might actually have a massive influence on the sector. After all, if the housing market changes as people look for more suburban and rural properties where they can work from home, there will be less need for office space to work in.The office property market will therefore have to adapt, something Prof White believes the industry is very good at.As he explains, if you strip out inflation, ""average rents in London are the same as they were 100 years ago"". He says this shows that the office property market has been very good at matching supply and demand for a very long period of time.As the UK's capital needed more offices in the 1950s and 1960s, many of the townhouses of the West End were converted from residential to commercial use. Then the City of London was rebuilt in the 1980s, with skyscrapers appearing, and Canary Wharf was constructed in London's former docklands in the 1990s.Recently, as London has needed more accommodation, buildings including office blocks have been turned back into flats and apartments. Overall, the property market has two things going for it even in these rapidly changing times. The first is that even if the price of property falls, it may still be a wise investment. This may sound perverse, but property is a long-term investment, and not many others are both secure and pay a good return. So if government bonds are paying 0.5% interest a year, or even less, and property is making 3-5%, you still have a good source of income if you are a private investor or global investment fund.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:The second factor is that for all the talk of bricks and mortar being solid and unchanging, the sector has over the years proved to be remarkably flexible.Over time the use of land and buildings can change, and often it does so remarkably quickly. Look at the environment you live in, and there will be plenty of evidence of that - shops that are now flats, old factories that are now hotels, and warehouses that have become dance studios.  The coronavirus pandemic may be a massive shock to property markets, but it may well just speed up changes that are already taking place.",11 June 2020,business
The treasure trove hidden in discarded computers,"What do you do with an old hard disk drive, the kind that still spins up inside most PCs, once it reaches the end of its life?If Allan Walton has his way, parts of it could soon be propelling your next car along the road, assuming you go electric.The University of Birmingham professor is a director in the firm Hypromag, which extracts and recycles neodymium magnets from used hard disks.  Neodymium is a rare earth metal - chemical elements considered essential ingredients in many of today’s must-have technologies, from smartphones to TV screens. Neodymium is used, among other things, to make magnets that turn the motors that drive electric vehicles.Prof Walton believes that in the next 10 years, his company could be recycling enough neodymium to meet a quarter of the UK’s demand - almost all of which is currently imported from China.Once electric vehicles are assembled and running, they are broadly seen as being more environmentally friendly than cars with an internal combustion engine. But making magnets from rare earths is far from green.Though processes needed to refine rare earths use many of the same chemicals found in oven cleaners and cosmetics, their waste can be destructive if not properly controlled. At one mining site, Bayan Obo in Inner Mongolia, they have contributed to a vast toxic lake.Next to the mine itself is a tailing dam, a reservoir created by what is left over from separating rare earths. Steel and aluminium already have large established recycling programmes which help to reduce chemical processing. However, rare earth minerals used in phones, hard drives and old wind turbines are generally lost. Four years ago at the University of Birmingham, Prof Walton and his mentor, Prof Rex Harris, discovered that running hydrogen gas through old hard-disk drives turns the magnets into powder which can be harvested, re-packed and coated, to become new magnets.Not only will the project offer a greener solution to the rare earths market, the global demand for these minerals means there is a business case to be built. “We are missing a trick. There is no trouble finding rare earths, it’s the processing them into a useful material, like a magnet,” says Prof Walton.This year, Hypromag expects to announce a deal with the UK car company Bentley. It has received a £2.6m grant from Innovate UK and a half a million pounds of investment and further partnership from an African junior mine, Mkango. However, the Hypromag solution will only meet a fraction of the growing demand for rare earths, which analysts estimate will double by 2025.Prof Walton believes that if Britain acts now and creates a scaled-up rare earths recycling industry, it could become a world leader.The opportunity is huge, with many emerging technologies such as 5G demanding rare earths, on top of the growing need for established technologies such as phone handsets, microprocessors and wind turbines.However, the main reason rare earths have been compared to oil, is government policies that will fuel the demand for electric vehicles. After 2025, the Netherlands will not sell petrol or diesel cars. The UK and France have pledged to meet this goal by 2040. This year, China aims for 12% of cars sold in the country to produce zero emissions.When it comes to the production of rare earths and magnets made from them, China is the world leader. The country corners the market because its companies can mine rare earths and process them locally into finished products. More than 70% of rare earth products are exported by China.More Technology of BusinessThe country corners the market because it is the only place in the world with companies that can make rare earth minerals into finished products. More than 70% of rare earth products are exported by China.And, its established supply chain offers them unmatchable discounts.Rare earths are part of the Made in China 2025 plan to become the world’s leading manufacturer.But while China exports processed products, the country’s natural resources are not rich in heavier types of rare earth that are most in demand, like the neodymium used for car magnets. China gets most of its neodymium from Burma and the United States, says Christopher Ecclestone, a mining strategist at Hallgarten. The Mountain Pass mine in California sells 100% of its rare earths in a concentrated form to China - and is part-owned by Chinese firm Shenghe Resources, which has a 9.9% stake. “The US is one of China’s largest sources of rare earths and the Chinese are taking it for a song. It drives the Pentagon crazy,” he says. What put China in control of the market was that rare earths were a by-product of already established mines, says Ian Higgins, the director of Less Common Metals in Ellesmere Port near Liverpool. Mr Higgins's firm is one of the only manufacturers outside of China to make and combine rare earth metals into alloys. He points out that Chinese mines are supported by government subsidies and opaque accounting practices. While environmental policy in China has improved, the largest mines were built before their implementation. “There is a lot of processing of rare earths which is horrific and there is also a lot of black and grey market smuggling of heavier rare earths.”  says Mr Higgins. However, he adds that the country is beginning to wake up to the environmental impact of its rare earths industry.The Covid-19 pandemic has caused global assembly lines to grind to a halt. But it has also spurred manufacturers who use rare earths to question the global supply chain and their reliance on a single source country.The crisis has pushed governments and businesses to ""localise resources,"", according to Andrew Bloodworth a director at the British Geological Survey.“People like me tell our government that any production that is concentrated in small places will be vulnerable to disruption,” says Mr Bloodworth. America, the UK and Europe are trying to build supply chains for rare earths outside of China. On 13 May, legislation was put before US legislators, aimed at giving tax breaks to the industry - $50m in funding was also earmarked for start-up mines in the US.In the EU, the Horizon 2020 fund has launched an initiative to build a supply chain across several European and Nordic countries, including Britain. In the UK, rare earths are integral to the government’s industrial strategy, according to Jeff Townsend, who this year set up a lobbying firm to represent the industry’s interests. “Government needs to understand and do more than set out a grand vision of an industrial strategy. It needs to get its hands dirty and provide the supply chain,” he says.  “Covid has knocked everyone sideways and lots of people are looking again at the way we do things,” says Mr Townsend. He adds: “If we make the decision that we want to be better, then we have to try to be better because that’s the only way we change society.”",9 June 2020,business
What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  We have lost 500 Billion Dollars a year, for many years, on Crazy Trade with China. NO MORE!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpOne of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Shops in England reopen after three months of lockdown,"Shops in England selling non-essential goods have reopened for the first time in almost three months.Retailers have had to introduce strict safety measures and the High Street experience will be very different.Amid fears about the health of the UK economy, getting a key part of the service sector running again is vital. But retail experts warned shops were unlikely to see any immediate relief.Boris Johnson has urged people to ""shop with confidence"".He said he was ""very optimistic"" about stores reopening - although acknowledged that retailers did not know whether there will be a ""huge wave of customers"" or a ""trickle"".HMV owner Doug Putman told the Today programme that he expected a rush in the first week of trading after his shops open their doors. But he said retailers could be faced with a problem if shoppers do not return in the same numbers as before the lockdown.""If you've got the same cost structure to run the business but sales are down even 20% it makes a lot of companies unviable.""""We're being very hesitant, we believe that it is going to be a tough year.""Although food shops, pharmacies, banks and other essential retailers have stayed open, vast swathes of the High Street, from bookshops to clothes outlets, have been closed since 23 March.Retailers are required to introduce plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers two metres (6ft 5ins) apart - measures that are already a regular fixture in supermarkets. Other measures will include pleas not to touch items unless customers intend to purchase them and decontaminating shopping baskets after each use. Retailers are promising there will be plenty of sanitiser on hand for customers.In most clothes shops, fitting rooms will be closed. Bookshops including Waterstones intend to put items in quarantine if browsed but not bought, while some jewellers are introducing ultraviolet boxes that can decontaminate items in minutes. There is also government funding for councils to deploy staff on the High Street to provide help and advice for both shoppers and shops.Not all stores will throw open their doors immediately. John Lewis will reopen just two outlets on Monday - in Kingston upon Thames and Poole - as part of a phased approach, with 11 others to follow on Thursday.The number of customers entering stores will be regulated, but Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations, hopes it will mean a better atmosphere for shoppers. ""To be honest, I actually think it's going to be the relative calmness of the experience that will probably be the main thing that strikes people.""But he did not expect a lifting of the measures any time soon. ""We expect this situation to last well into autumn and perhaps winter so we need to be thinking ahead for how things will work when the weather's not so great,"" he said. Some other retailers selling products classed as essential - such as DIY, furniture and bicycles - have also been reopening. Furniture giant Ikea opened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues.Shoppers at Selfridges, which is reopening its London, Manchester and Birmingham branches, will have the chance to try before they buy, but any clothes will then be quarantined, while shoes and accessories will be cleaned with sanitising spray or steamed.Primark, which will open each of its 153 English stores, has pledged to ensure basket handles are cleaned after each use and that every second till will be closed to maintain social distancing for customers and employees.Many stores are encouraging customers to make purchases by contactless card payments, with limits increased to £45. Arcadia, which owns the likes of Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, has said it will not accept cash.London's West End, which includes Oxford Street, is expecting about 80% fewer visitors when it reopens on Monday. Many retailers and analysts are watching closely to see if the surge in online shopping during lockdown continues, possibly piling more pressure on High Streets that have already suffered a wave of closures.Tracy Harvey, managing director of the independent department store Harveys of Halifax, says customers are set for a ""quite different"" experience when they return on Monday. The five-storey shop will be opening just two floors initially. But it won't be just shoppers who have to do things differently, she told the BBC. ""Some of our staff have been working in the building for 30 years. We've done training, but breaking the habits of a lifetime is going to be challenging. We naturally do things without thinking sometimes, so it will be a challenge.""Harveys is the sort traditional department store where some customers come in every day, she said. ""We know our customers' names. We are now asking out staff to interact with them in a very different way. It's going to take some getting used to.""Tracy intends to keep the number of customers in the store at any one time to a bare minimum. ""We could get more people in, but we have decided to keep the numbers low so that the people who are in can walk around and explore more freely rather than be dictated to every step of the way.""The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body representing the sector, warned that the unlocking was unlikely to provide any immediate boost for the sector. Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, said: ""Retailers have been under immense pressure for the past three months but the reopening of non-essential shops is unlikely to deliver immediate relief. A mix of low consumer confidence and limits on the number of people able to enter stores mean that many shops will continue to suffer lower footfall - and lower sales - for some time to come.""She called on the government to help stimulate demand with a short-term cut in VAT or a temporary income tax cut for lower-income workers.In Northern Ireland, non-essential shops reopened on Friday, but there is still no date for Wales and Scotland.In England, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will not be allowed to open their doors until 4 July at the earliest - and even then, only if they can meet social distancing measures.Key to a successful reopening of the economy is the two-metre social distancing rule, the hospitality industry says. Pubs and restaurants have warned that they cannot make money if customers are required to keep two-metres apart, and have urged that the distance limit be reduced to one metre.Mr Johnson has commissioned a review into two-metre distancing, saying there was ""margin for manoeuvre"" as the number of coronavirus cases falls.The government is under intense pressure to get the economy moving as fears grow of a new wave of job losses as furlough scheme that has supported eight million workers is wound down.On Sunday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged that more redundancies were inevitable. ""Primarily we need to reopen our economy safely and slowly. That is the most important thing to try and safeguard as many of those jobs as possible,"" he told The Andrew Marr Show.But he warned: ""There is going to be hardship ahead. People are going to lose their jobs.""",15 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: China to launch new airline despite travel downturn,"China's second-biggest airline is to launch a new carrier despite a severe global downturn in passengers caused by the coronavirus pandemic.China Eastern has joined forces with a range of partners including China's biggest online travel agency Trip.com.The new airline will be focused on the island destination of Hainan, home to eight million and a free-trade hub.Some have questioned the timing of the launch which comes as the airline industry struggles to survive.Government-backed China Eastern will own a majority 51% share in the new carrier, which will be called Sanya International Airlines. Other backers include Shanghai-based Juneyao Airlines and a unit of Trip.com according to an announcement made to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Sunday.No timeframe was given for the launch of the new airline, which will need regulatory approval. The partners are hoping to capitalise on Hainan's growing significance in China. The island is about 30 times the size of Hong Kong and is a popular holiday destination for Chinese tourists.  Chinese president Xi Jinping also wants to turn the island into the nation's largest free-trade zone. Beijing has outlined plans to lower the income tax rate on Hainan for selected individuals and companies to 15%, and relax visa requirements for tourists and business travellers.The launch plans come during the biggest crisis the airline industry has faced as planes are grounded and strict quarantines put in place to curb the spread of the Covid-19. Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at FlightGlobal magazine, said: ""The airline's official launch will likely depend on the continued recovery of Chinese domestic traffic and the Covid-19 situation in both China and regionally.""It takes time to build an airline, however, so a great deal of work needs to take place in terms of equipment and personnel before the airline takes to the air.""A number of high-profile airlines have been struggling to survive during the crisis including Virgin Australia, Thai Airways and Colombia's Avianca. Other airlines have been forced to layoff thousands of workers and downsize operations. The airline industry could suffer losses of more than $84bn (£66bn) this year, the International Air Transport Association, warned last week.But Shaun Rein, founder of the China Market Research Group, said it was actually a good time to start a new airline focused on Hainan. ""Even before Covid, 2020 was the year of domestic Chinese tourism as China wants to focus more on seeing their own country, especially hot spots like Hainan, Yunnan and emerging ones like Gansu.""He added that the US-China trade war has seen ""emerging patriotism with Chinese citizens wanting to show their children how great their country is and to teach them more about its heritage"". Meanwhile, ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have discouraged many Chinese travellers from visiting the former British colony.""Hainan itself as a destination is hot right now, especially as the government supports duty-free shopping there. Hainan also has no quarantine or other travel restrictions.""",15 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Summer holiday plans at risk over lack of travel insurance,"Holidaymakers are unlikely to be covered by new travel insurance if they cancel an overseas break this summer because they are told to self-isolate.At present, no policies cover trips abroad as UK Foreign Office advice is to avoid all but essential travel.Any relaxation of that guidance could signal the start of a summer getaway.But travellers whose plans are affected because they have been in contact with coronavirus cases may struggle to make a claim via their insurance.People who have an annual policy bought or renewed before the outbreak may be better placed.Yet, concerns have also been raised that anyone taking part in trials for a vaccine will see any existing cover for coronavirus-related claims invalidated by taking part.NHS worker Anne Elliott, from Bristol, volunteered to take part in a year-long Covid-19 vaccine study.She was given an information sheet which told her that taking part could affect any insurance policies she has.She is planning to travel overseas later in the year for her daughter's wedding. Her travel insurance policy is part of a packaged bank account.""We told [the bank] about the trial that I wanted to take part in, but the answer was an emphatic no - that if I went ahead with the trial, I wouldn't be covered,"" she said.Unrelated claims, such as medical treatment for a broken bone while overseas, would be valid, but there would be nothing for anything related to coronavirus.She has pulled out of the trial as a result.The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said taking part in such a trial would not exclude everyone from cover, but volunteers must tell their provider which would then decide how the policy is affected.Mrs Elliott argued that, with insurance companies among the beneficiaries of any successful vaccine, there should be some leeway.""I used to work in insurance so understand why they say no but perhaps there should be a special exemption for people who are trying to help,"" she said.There has been considerable discussion and debate over whether the tourism season will be permitted this summer.Holidaymakers may believe that a green light to travel opens the options of an overseas break in the sun.Yet, there remains the possibility of testing positive for the virus, or coming into contact with somebody who has it and being alerted by the new test and trace systems being used in the UK.The government has said it is a ""civic duty"" to self-isolate for 14 days after being notified of a contact.This could lead to cancelled or delayed holidays, but insurance broadly falls into three categories:A number of new policies are covering people for emergency treatment or repatriation for Covid-19 contracted while in a resort, but not cases that arose by getting it beforehand in the UK, according to Brian Brown, of Defaqto - an information company which analyses insurance industry data.He said insurers were being ""cagey"" as there were serious risks to their business in the event of a second wave of the pandemic.Malcolm Tarling, spokesman for the insurers' trade body, the ABI, said: ""Given the fast-moving travel situation, insurers are monitoring developments closely, to ensure that as the situation improves, this can be reflected in the scope of cover, and availability of new travel policies being offered.""",15 June 2020,business
