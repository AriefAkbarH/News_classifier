Trump targets foreign workers with new visa freeze,"US President Donald Trump has extended a pause on some green cards and suspended visas for other foreign workers until the end of 2020.High-skilled tech workers, non-agricultural seasonal helpers, au pairs and top executives will be affected.The White House said the move will create jobs for Americans hurting economically due to the pandemic.But critics say the White House is exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to tighten up immigration laws.In a briefing for reporters, the administration said the freeze, in place through the end of the year, would impact about 525,000 people. That includes an estimated 170,000 people blocked by the decision to extend a ban on some new green cards - which grants permanent residence to foreigners. The White House first announced it was halting those visas in April, an order that had been set to expire on Monday. Existing visa holders are not expected to be affected under the new restrictions announced on Monday.The order also applies to H-1B visas, many of which are granted to Indian tech workers. Critics say these visas have allowed Silicon Valley companies to outsource American jobs to lower-paid foreign employees. Last year, there were about 225,000 applications competing for 85,000 spots available through the H1-B visa programme. The order will suspend most H-2B visas for seasonal workers, including those in the hospitality industry, except those in agriculture, the food processing industry and healthcare professionals.The order will restrict J-1 short-term exchange visas, a category that includes university students and foreign au pairs who provide childcare. Professors and scholars are not included in the order. There will be a provision to request exemptions. L visas for managers and other key employees of multinational corporations will also be suspended.The aim is to get ""the best and the brightest"" and ""the most value for our economy,"" a senior official said on the background call.Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favours restrictions, told AP news agency: ""This is a bold move by the Trump administration to protect American jobs.""But the American Civil Liberties Union said: ""It's the exploitation of a pandemic to reshape immigration law, while superseding Congress.""The new policy is also opposed by many businesses, which rely on foreign workers.""As the economy rebounds, American businesses will need assurances that they can meet all their workforce needs,"" the Chamber of Commerce wrote in a letter this month warning against new restrictions.

Feeling the impact of Trump's foreign worker squeeze,"Jiri Stejskal is the type of entrepreneur that helps the US economy to flourish.The 58-year-old runs a successful translation business on the outskirts of Philadelphia.His company - Cetra Language Solutions - employs 35 people and has an annual turnover of $5m (£4m).His high profile clients include food giant Nestle and the US defence department.Mr Stejskal also happens to be an immigrant to the US. He arrived in the country in 1988 as a political refugee from the former Czechoslovakia, and turned his life into a business success story.This is relevant, because under President Trump's continuing ""America First"" policy, US companies are being told to hire more home-grown Americans instead of giving jobs to people from overseas like Mr Stejskal.In fact, two years ago the president signed the Presidential Executive Order on Buy American and Hire American.This called on US government agencies to tighten up the immigration system, including a key temporary work visa called H-1B.The name may not be memorable, but this visa allows US firms to hire skilled foreign workers for a three-year period.Mr Stejskal says that it is now increasingly difficult to get an application approved, and new figures back him up.In 2017 the rejection rate for H-1B requests was 13%, but this year it has risen to 32%, according to a survey last month by non-partisan think tank National Foundation for American Policy.At the same time, it found that the rate of rejections for applications to extend current visas for a further three years rose from 3% to 18%.""This is misguided protectionism,"" says Mr Stejskal.

Lawsuit alleges defeat devices in petrol cars,"Up to 1.4 million Renault and Nissan vehicles sold in Britain could be equipped with illegal defeat devices, according to a lawsuit being launched today.They include a petrol-powered version of one of the UK's best-selling family cars, the Nissan Qashqai.The law firm behind the case, Harcus Parker, claims that some cars produced up to 15 times the legal level of nitrogen oxides when used on the road.Both companies deny the claims.Harcus Parker says it has seen independent test data which suggests that 1.3 million diesel cars built by Nissan and its French partner Renault may have been fitted with defeat devices. These are systems which turn emissions controls on when the vehicle is being tested, but switches them off when it is being used on the road - in order to improve their performance, reliability or both.But it also claims that up to 100,000 petrol powered cars may have been affected as well. These are Nissan Qashqais fitted with a 1.2 litre engine. Emissions from diesel vehicles have come under heavy scrutiny since 2015, following a major scandal involving the German giant Volkswagen.Volkswagen has paid out more than €30bn (£27bn) in fines, compensation and buyback schemes as a result. It is continuing to fight a number of consumer lawsuits, including one in the UK involving some 90,000 car owners. Petrol cars, however, generally produce lower quantities of nitrogen oxides (NOx) than diesels, and have not previously been shown to have been involved in emissions cheating - although there have been some claims to the contrary.Harcus Parker claims that the 1.2l Qashqai produces many times the legal level of NOx when used in real world driving conditions. It says that tests carried out by the Department for Transport (DfT) in 2017 confirmed that this was the case. The DfT subsequently asked Nissan if it could modify the design to reduce emissions - but this never happened.""For the first time, we have seen evidence that car manufacturers may be cheating emissions tests of petrol, as well as diesel vehicles"", says Damon Parker, senior partner at the law firm.""The data suggests to me these vehicles much like some VWs and Mercedes cars, know when they are being tested - and are on their best behaviour then and only then"".Harcus Parker claims this means customers overpaid for their vehicles, and should be entitled to some £5,000 each in compensation.""All Groupe Renault vehicles are, and always have been, type-approved in accordance with the laws and regulations for all the countries in which they are sold and are not fitted with 'defeat devices'"", Renault said in a statement.Nissan said the following in response to the planned lawsuit:""Nissan strongly refutes these claims. Nissan has not and does not employ defeat devices in any of the cars that we make, and all Nissan vehicles fully comply with applicable emissions legislation.""Nissan said the 2017 report showed variances for most brands involved. and that it said that the Nissan vehicle tested complied ""with all required regulatory limits.""Emissions Analytics, an independent firm which specialises in emissions testing carried out in 'real world' conditions, agrees that the petrol Qashqai does produce very high levels of NOx.""We tested this same engine some time ago"", says founder Nick Molden.""We found it produced about 16 times more NOx in real world conditions than the official level"".Nissan, however, insists that ""emissions standards have evolved since 2017, and we have introduced a new range of powertrains to meet them"".",23 June 2020,business
Former chancellor Sajid Javid warns against return to austerity,"Former chancellor Sajid Javid has warned against a return to austerity as the UK economy struggles with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. In a report by the Centre for Policy Studies, he called for low taxes on business to aid the UK's recovery.The conservative think tank, which was co-founded by Margaret Thatcher, said it should be based on ""a dynamic private sector and low taxes.""Labour has said the government should have offered more generous support.The report by the think tank said that a quick economic bounce back from the coronavirus crisis is is not likely.But it said coronavirus emergency spending measures should be stopped, if possible, by April 2021.It said that polls suggest the UK is ""not ready"" to return to austerity measures introduced by former chancellor George Osborne, ""necessary though they were"".Instead, the report calls for tax to shift away from profits and incomes and towards reformed property tax and tightening tax reliefs ""which unduly favour the wealthy"".National insurance should be given a ""significant temporary"" reduction to make it cheaper for employers to take on staff.The former cabinet minister, who resigned from the Treasury in February, said ""early hopes of a V-shaped recovery"" had ""proved optimistic"".He predicted that ""some long-term damage to the economy"" had become ""unavoidable"", with as many as 2.5 million people out of work due to the Covid-19 lockdown.But to speed up the rate of people re-entering employment, Mr Javid argued in the After The Virus report, published on Tuesday, that ministers must make it easier for businesses to hire workers.""If we want to support and stimulate employment, then axiomatically the best option is to cut the payroll tax - employer's National Insurance,"" Mr Javid said.""Tax employment less, and all other things being equal you will end up with more of it.""Other recommendations made in the report include temporarily cutting VAT and bringing forward ""shovel ready"" infrastructure projects, with Mr Javid arguing that the ""only way out of this crisis is growth"".He joins fellow former chancellor Alistair Darling in calling for an emergency VAT cut to boost consumer spending, a move undertaken by the Labour peer after the 2008 financial crisis.Mr Javid said: ""If we want to secure the strongest possible recovery, it's essential that no stone is left unturned.""The Labour Party, in a report in March on the economic effects of coronavirus, criticised the government for acting too slowly and said it should underwrite a bigger proportion of wages for those who lose their jobs",23 June 2020,business
Fancy a pint? For social easing it may be too soon to celebrate,"It's the moment we've all been waiting for. The government is expected to announce measures that will allow pubs, restaurants, cinemas, galleries and theatres to re-open under relaxed but still constraining rules on the 4th of July. It's not quite social Independence Day, but the expected announcement that social distancing measures that require two metres distance in most settings will be relaxed to one metre has been welcomed by the hospitality industry as ""an important staging post"". It's ""a helpful moment for the national psyche"", according to Kate Nicholls, head of the trade group UK Hospitality. But the champagne is still on ice. And could yet be put back in the economic refrigerator.""We are only able to move forward this week because the vast majority of people have taken steps to control the virus,"" a number 10 spokesman told the BBC.""But the more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these steps if it is necessary to stop the virus running out of control.""Many establishments are straining at the leash to re-open. Peter Borg-Neal, who runs 28 pubs has already provocatively said he intends to re-open on 4 July whether or not the government gives him the green light. Others are less gung ho. Several pubs and restaurants have told me they do not see the point of re-opening even under one metre distancing rules as it will be impossible to police and the business would still lose money. That's the supply side of the equation - the other side is demand. Most of us want to go out for a drink or a meal or a film but how many would actually step through the door? Recent polling by Ipsos Mori found that six out of 10 people would feel uncomfortable returning to a pub or restaurant. Some operators feel that the government's re-opening guidelines - that are expected to accompany tomorrow's announcement - may be counter-productive. 3rdlargest UK employer in 20183.2 millionworkers in the sector99%of hospitality businesses are SMEs£130bnannual turnover in 201867%expect it will be ""months"" before going to a restaurant""Single use menus, banning condiments, insisting on mask wearing - you are making people afraid of using a pepper pot. We have to persuade people there is nothing to fear,"" said Jonathan Downey, head of street food venue operator London Union and head of lobbying group Hospitality Union. There are other major concerns. Once people have had a few drinks, who will police the social distancing measures that are expected in the guidelines,  even at one metre. ""To think that a young bar tender could do that is nuts"" said one pub owner. And what about the legal position? Could a hospitality venue owner be sued if someone contracted the virus and blamed the management for a potentially life-threatening condition?On this point there is good and bad news for the industry, according to Kate Nicholls, head of Hospitality UK. The bad news for venues is that no insurer will touch that risk with a barge pole. The good news is that it will be almost impossible to establish whether the virus was in fact contracted on the premises. Going to the pub will be entirely at the pub-goers risk. But not opening hospitality venues will represent a grave risk to the economy and up to 3 million jobs. Everyone wants the semblance of normality that a further easing of social lockdown measures will bring. But as the government has made clear, if things don't go to plan and the virus sees another surge it may be too soon to pull up all those two metre distancing tapes on the floor and call time on this health, social and economic menace.

Lawsuit alleges defeat devices in petrol cars,"Up to 1.4 million Renault and Nissan vehicles sold in Britain could be equipped with illegal defeat devices, according to a lawsuit being launched today.They include a petrol-powered version of one of the UK's best-selling family cars, the Nissan Qashqai.The law firm behind the case, Harcus Parker, claims that some cars produced up to 15 times the legal level of nitrogen oxides when used on the road.Both companies deny the claims.Harcus Parker says it has seen independent test data which suggests that 1.3 million diesel cars built by Nissan and its French partner Renault may have been fitted with defeat devices. These are systems which turn emissions controls on when the vehicle is being tested, but switches them off when it is being used on the road - in order to improve their performance, reliability or both.But it also claims that up to 100,000 petrol powered cars may have been affected as well. These are Nissan Qashqais fitted with a 1.2 litre engine. Emissions from diesel vehicles have come under heavy scrutiny since 2015, following a major scandal involving the German giant Volkswagen.Volkswagen has paid out more than €30bn (£27bn) in fines, compensation and buyback schemes as a result. It is continuing to fight a number of consumer lawsuits, including one in the UK involving some 90,000 car owners. Petrol cars, however, generally produce lower quantities of nitrogen oxides (NOx) than diesels, and have not previously been shown to have been involved in emissions cheating - although there have been some claims to the contrary.Harcus Parker claims that the 1.2l Qashqai produces many times the legal level of NOx when used in real world driving conditions. It says that tests carried out by the Department for Transport (DfT) in 2017 confirmed that this was the case. The DfT subsequently asked Nissan if it could modify the design to reduce emissions - but this never happened.""For the first time, we have seen evidence that car manufacturers may be cheating emissions tests of petrol, as well as diesel vehicles"", says Damon Parker, senior partner at the law firm.""The data suggests to me these vehicles much like some VWs and Mercedes cars, know when they are being tested - and are on their best behaviour then and only then"".Harcus Parker claims this means customers overpaid for their vehicles, and should be entitled to some £5,000 each in compensation.""All Groupe Renault vehicles are, and always have been, type-approved in accordance with the laws and regulations for all the countries in which they are sold and are not fitted with 'defeat devices'"", Renault said in a statement.Nissan said the following in response to the planned lawsuit:""Nissan strongly refutes these claims.

Will Rishi Sunak cut shop prices to boost the High Street?,"""Timely, temporary and targeted"" was the advice given to the Treasury Select Committee on stimulating the economy by the former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis.These words found their way into the pre-Budget documents to describe the immediate 13-month VAT cut from 17.5% to 15% announced by then Chancellor Alistair Darling.The same phrase was used by current Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his Budget in March to describe the first steps in pandemic support packages. And, following Germany's temporary 3% cut in VAT, the prospect of a similar tax cut is again up for discussion in the UK.The policy is certainly timely, because it can be enacted with immediate effect. And because it is reversible, it serves as a temporary stimulus. In 2008, it was argued that a general VAT cut was targeted because it was aimed at supporting consumer confidence. But that is far more debatable. It certainly was expensive, though. The upfront cost was £13bn over two years, amounting to half of the Darling stimulus package. Most of this shifted spending in time into the cheaper VAT period. The net impact? A 1% increase in retail sales, just shy of the 0.5% overall boost to consumers predicted by the Treasury at the time, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.The argument floating around government earlier in the month was that there was little point in stimulating shops, restaurants and pubs that were not open. Physically enabling trade would be a prerequisite.The thinking in Germany was to incentivise spending and consumer confidence as soon as retail reopened, rather than see those who could not physically spend during lockdown, and were so forced to save, choosing to maintain high savings. The point about the temporary cut is to get money flowing in the economy quickly. It has some interesting quirks as a policy. Back in late 2008, 43% of local shops only changed their prices at the till, leaving shelf prices unchanged. It is a considerable logistical cost to do so.However, the impact on consumer confidence was marked. There was a significant rise in sentiment towards both buying household goods and making major purchases, according to the Nationwide consumer confidence survey. The major purchases index went above boom time levels and continued even after VAT went back up, but then fell sharply when VAT was increased again under the Coalition in January 2011.The considerations here are whether the Treasury chooses to make this truly targeted on particular sectors - such as pubs and restaurants, rather than pass further boost to say mainly online retailers. The cost may be less than normal, too, given VAT revenues are in any case going to be sharply down. But it is still pricey. Also, it is unclear how much additional difference a 2.5% cut in prices will really achieve on top of already anticipated reopening sales and price cuts? Wherever things go, a clear decision will be needed quickly.

"Black business managers still underrepresented, says study","Efforts to increase the number of black managers at British companies have stalled, according to a business group.Just 1.5% of top bosses at UK companies are black.That compares to 3% of the population of England and Wales.While the ratio is an improvement on the 1.4% of 2014, there is much ground still to cover, said Sandra Kerr, race director at Business in the Community, which has campaigned for workplace racial equality for 25 years.""It is clear that black people continue to be under-represented at a senior level,"" she said.""Black livelihoods matter and employers need to take urgent action to ensure that their organisation is inclusive and a place where people of any ethnic background can thrive and succeed.""The new figures coincide with the 72nd anniversary of the arrival of HMT Empire Windrush, which brought workers from the Caribbean to the UK.They also come amid global protests over racial inequality and as some older British companies come to terms with their historical links with the slave trade.Pub chain Greene King and insurance market Lloyd's of London apologised for those ties last week.One of Greene King's founders owned a number of plantations in the Caribbean.Meanwhile, maritime insurance - which was focused on Lloyd's - thrived on the trans-Atlantic slave trade.Lloyd's has said it will donate to charities representing black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups.Greene King said it would make a ""substantial investment to benefit the BAME community"".In March, a report from the Carnegie Trust, University College London's Centre for Longitudinal Studies and Operation Black Vote said young BAME members are 47% more likely to to be on a zero-hours contract.The researchers compared the experiences of 25-year-olds in England.They looked at people who are white, as well mixed-race, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African and Caribbean, and other minority ethnicities, sometimes collectively known as BAME workers.That report followed research from February that about a third of FTSE 100 firms have no ethnic minority board members.",22 June 2020,business
British Gas owner plans to launch cheaper energy rival,"The UK's biggest household energy supplier, British Gas, will soon face competition from a new, cheaper supplier from its own stable. Parent Centrica has been trialling a digital-only ""challenger"" brand under the name British Gas X amid the highly competitive world of energy supply.The company has been shedding customers and this month said it would cut 5,000 jobs.Centrica would not comment but is expected to give more details in July. A test website for British Gas X is already up and running. It says the service is designed for ""digitally savvy"" customers, with everything done online. It also says customers can ""switch at any time with no exit fees"" and that the energy they use will be offset from ""100% renewable"" sources.Centrica plans to base its new no-frills service on this platform, however a final name has yet to be decided. British Gas, once the sole supplier of gas to the country, is still the dominant force in energy supply with more than seven million customers, but it faces tough competition. Last year alone it lost almost 290,000 customers.Energy regulator Ofgem says there are currently around 60 suppliers operating around the country, and the landscape continues to evolve. Until recently supply was dominated by a ""Big Six"" but that is breaking down. Incomer Ovo recently bought major supplier SSE, and medium-sized players such as Shell-backed First Utility are making inroads.Meanwhile, a clutch of smaller entrants have tried and failed to make money in this market, with  more than 20 going under in the past year. Centrica's jobs shake-up was ordered by its new chief executive, Chris O'Shea. He said the company had more than 80 different employee contracts, ""each with multiple variants, with many of the agreements dating back over 35 years"", which, he said, needed to be modernised.Centrica currently has about 27,000 employees, with 20,000 of these based in the UK. In February, the firm blamed a big loss in 2019 on falling gas prices and the energy price cap.The price cap on electricity and gas bills came into effect in January 2019 and was a flagship policy of former prime minister Theresa May to end what she called ""rip-off"" prices. A number of energy companies have said the policy has affected their business and profits. Centrica made a loss of £849m in the last calendar year compared with a £987m profit in 2018.",22 June 2020,business
Wirecard: Scandal-hit firm says missing €1.9bn may not exist,"Scandal-hit payments firm Wirecard has said the €1.9bn (£1.7bn) missing from its accounts simply may not exist.Wirecard's chief executive quit on Friday as the search for the missing cash hit a dead end in the Philippines.On Sunday the central bank of Philippines said none of the money appears to have entered the country's financial system.The German company also said it was withdrawing its financial results for 2019 and the first quarter of 2020.""The Management Board of Wirecard assesses on the basis of further examination that there is a prevailing likelihood that the bank trust account balances in the amount of 1.9 billion EUR do not exist,"" the company said in a statement on Monday.The missing money accounts for around a quarter of its total balance sheet.The company said it was continuing to discuss a financial lifeline with banks, including a current arrangement that is due to expire at the end of this month.It said it was also considering several potential plans to save the company, including cost cuts, the restructuring of its operations, and selling or shutting parts of the business.The scandal emerged after a series of articles in the Financial Times last year focusing on alleged accounting irregularities in Wirecard's Asian operations.The missing money was supposed to be held in accounts at two Asian banks and had been set aside for ""risk management"", the company said.The exit of Wirecard's chief executive Markus Braun on Friday came after auditor EY refused to sign off its 2019 accounts over the missing funds.Wirecard joined Germany's blue-chip Dax 30 share index two years ago. At the time, it was valued at €24bn, but its shares have crashed in recent days giving it a stock market valuation of less than €3bn.",22 June 2020,business
"'It makes me upset coming here, it's a ghost town'","""It makes me upset coming down here - it's like a ghost town.""Darren Labbett sadly surveys his warehouse.As the managing director of the 40-year-old wholesale business Woods Foodservice, he's used to a hive of activity.""Usually there would be five forklifts whizzing around, lorries unloading, a queue of lorries bringing in pallets of stock,"" he says. ""It was a 24/7 business with bodies everywhere.""The Uxbridge-based wholesaler supplies restaurants and pubs. When their businesses were shuttered, Woods lost almost all of its turnover.Now the company's fleet of vans sits idle outside. It has survived by furloughing its staff and selling food directly to households.But that only contributes a fraction of its previous income. Even those sales have dwindled as supermarket activity has returned to normal over the last few months. As pubs and restaurants start to think about opening up, wholesalers are concerned that there is still too much uncertainty to expect business to bounce back.Mr Labbett says the hospitality industry needs more time to prepare.""Many of our customers say they won't reopen until September, and that would be a disaster for us.""One of his customers is the Greene Oak pub in Windsor. They have started a village shop to keep them and their suppliers ticking over. But while there was an initial flurry of customers, that interest has died down.Landlord James Lyons-Shaw is expecting sales to drop to 30% when they open their doors again and he says things will be tough for everyone in the industry.""There are a lot of businesses behind bars and restaurants. If we're not doing well they're not doing well. All of us are dependent on customers coming back and with enthusiasm to spend money.""He is concerned that safety measures introduced to protect customers will ""take the fun"" out of eating out, and put people off going to the pub.  A major issue for wholesalers is paying for the large spaces they need to store their goods. Their customers - pubs and restaurants - were told they didn't have to pay business rates, a tax on their buildings, from March.Wholesalers, however, still do. The Federation of Wholesale Distributors says this is an anomaly and would like to see the government extend rates relief to those who supply the hospitality industry.Chief executive James Bielby says half of the members they spoke to in a recent survey said they think they will collapse by Christmas without help.""Wholesalers are being squeezed because outstanding customers aren't paying their bills, while suppliers at the other end still require payment. There'll be no profit until this time next year at the earliest.""While Darren Labbett from Woods Foodservice says that the government's job retention scheme has saved his company, he still feels it is unfair that his business rates are due.""We have a 30,000 sq ft warehouse which rent and rates need to be paid on and we haven't got any revenue coming in. I can't reduce the size of the warehouse.""Earlier this month, a group of cross-party MPs wrote to the government to warn that the sector is now in crisis and to ask them to extend business rates relief to wholesalers.They said that without more support, there could be an impact on the UK's food supply, businesses could collapse and jobs could be lost. In response, the government says there is already support in place for wholesalers in the shape of the furlough scheme and business loans, and that local authorities can choose to make grants to businesses if they feel there is a particular local need.

"'I used to hate road cycling, now I design biking gear'","The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Remi Clermont, co-founder and co-owner of cycling clothing company Cafe du Cycliste.When Remi Clermont was a teenager, he was embarrassed that his father liked going road cycling.By road cycling, he means riding around on the type of bike you see in the Tour de France - ""drop handlebars"" that sweep downwards, and thin tyres.Despite Remi being born and raised in the Alsace region of eastern France, and road biking being one of the country's most popular sports, his young self just didn't like it.""My friends and I, all the kids, were into mountain biking at the time (the early 1990s),"" says the 44-year-old. ""Road biking was seen as very boring. I was almost ashamed when I told friends that my dad was into it.""Little did teenage Remi know, he would go on to catch the Lycra and tarmac cycling bug himself in his 20s. And then, at the age of 33, launch what is today one of the fastest-growing road cycling clothing companies - Cafe du Cycliste.Founded in 2009, in Nice on the French Riviera, the firm says it now sells €4m (£3.6m; $4.5m) worth of jerseys, shorts and other clothing items per year, with 50% year-on-year growth.""You can certainly say I changed my mind,"" jokes Remi.However, before we return to cycling, we need to go to the world of competitive kayaking. Remi took up kayaking when he was nine, and went on to be a member of the French national team for six years in his 20s.""My speciality was white water kayaking,"" he says. ""Sadly the discipline is not an Olympic sport, so I never got to go to one of them, but it was great to represent France in international competitions.""And it was the reason I got into road biking. Because you couldn't kayak in the winter when it was too cold, I'd cycle to keep my fitness up.""Then when he retired from the water sport at the age of 28, he kept up the cycling. As he was not paid for his kayaking, Remi had also needed to hold down a full-time job in his 20s. After getting a business degree from the École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris, he worked in the sporting corporate hospitality sector. This included working at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.A year later he got a job in the marketing department of the European arm of a US IT firm.""I wasn't a great fit for the role as I knew nothing about IT,"" says Remi. ""But it had one massive thing going for it - it was based in Nice, which really is cycling paradise. The hills behind Nice [which lead up to the Alps] are just wonderful.""Remi was soon spending weekends cycling with a workmate called Andre Stewart. Then Andre quit to buy and run a cafe in a small village to the north west of Nice, naming it Cafe du Cycliste.More The Boss features:Two year later, in 2009, Remi also left the IT firm to join his friend at the cafe business. His plan was to design and launch a range of upmarket road cycling clothes that they could sell to all the riders who stopped for a drink and a bite to eat.Specifically, Remi wanted to produce the cycling jerseys that he says you couldn't buy in France at the time - plain and understated ones that wouldn't look out of place in a posh menswear store. ""The only cycling jerseys you could buy at the time in France were racing ones with big logos and sponsors, that made you look as if you were competing in the Tour de France,"" he says. ""I wanted to produce something completely different.""There was a catch, however, in that Remi had no knowledge of or experience in the clothing sector. But undeterred, he says he set to work.""I started to learn everything I could,"" he says. ""I had some friends in Paris who were working in clothing and fashion, so I got some tips and helpful mentoring from them.""And I started going to all the trade shows, and asking millions of questions, and contacting plenty of factories in Italy.""A few months later, a manufacturer in Italy agreed to make Remi's first design for a cycling jersey, and the fashion side of Cafe du Cycliste was up and running.Sales from the shop were stubbornly slow, however, so Remi launched a website to target online customers, especially from overseas. With little to no money for advertising, he would send free samples to cycling journalists in various countries.They would then write enthusiastic reviews, and sales quickly took off, particular in the UK and Japan. ""Cyclists in the UK and Japan were really open to what we are doing,"" says Remi. ""And that remains the case, still only 10 to 15% of our sales are in France. Many cyclists here still want to look as if they are taking part in a race all the time.""British cycling journalist and commentator Rebecca Charlton says that brands like Cafe du Cycliste and the UK's Rapha, Le Col and Assos have led the way over the past decade in offering upmarket, stylish cycling clothing. This has coincided with a big increase in the number of people taking up the sport, leading to booming sales at the firms.""The trends, cuts and designs of modern cycling kit are a far cry from the extremely limited options I had as a young girl,"" she says.""And the psychology isn't to be underestimated either - when you've got a new cycling outfit you feel that bit more motivated to get out of the door, and you feel good. When it flatters, and fits perfectly, the ride feels more comfortable, and it definitely adds morale.""Back at Cafe du Cycliste's head office in Nice, Remi says that recent sales have mirrored the industry-wide increase as a result of coronavirus, with more people taking up cycling either to get some exercise or avoid public transport.His dad is also a fan of the clothing, which Remi continues to design himself, and is manufactured in a number of European  factories. However, his father initially wasn't impressed back in 2009.""When I first started out, he wouldn't wear it, because it was too different to the race jerseys he was used to,"" says Remi.",22 June 2020,business
Have we become too reliant on Big Tech firms?,"""We wouldn't have survived without Amazon,"" says Keith Ingram, owner of vinyl records shop Assai Records.When lockdown hit on 23 March in the UK, Mr Ingram had to shut his shops in Edinburgh and Dundee, and sell his stock through Amazon Marketplace. Now, his sales are 40% higher than last year. ""Without Amazon, we would have had to furlough all employees for all of lockdown. Instead, we furloughed them for four weeks until we adjusted ourselves to the new normal, and then we could retrain staff to help us fulfil our online orders,"" he says.It's not just Amazon that has been used more during the pandemic. Apple and Android smartphones and tablets, Facebook's apps and Microsoft tools have provided crucial links with friends, family and colleagues.And that's certainly been great for investors and the billionaires behind these firms. Shares in Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft all hit all-time highs on the stock market in June.Between 18 March and 19 May, Amazon's Jeff Bezos saw his wealth swell by $34.6bn (£27.6bn) and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg's wealth rose by $25bn (£19.9bn), according to a recent report.But is this reliance on Big Tech getting out of control? ""Amazon have gone from being the dominant gatekeepers for online commerce to being the dominant gatekeeper for much of retail because of the lockdowns,"" says Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, the US organisation that challenges concentrated economic and political power.Meanwhile, this week the UK government announced that it would be using a coronavirus-tracing app based on technology from Apple and Google.Germany, Italy and Denmark are among other countries also using that system.Big Tech firms have been getting even bigger during the pandemic and their success means they have plenty of funds to snap up other businesses.For example, in May Facebook announced its second biggest deal - a plan to buy a 10% stake in India's Jio, a telecoms and digital services business.""All of them will be in the M&A [mergers and acquisitions] game if they're not already. Start-ups are more likely to sell out during the pandemic when they might struggle to meet their obligations and the buyout looks especially attractive - the pandemic is speeding up the buyout date in some cases,"" says Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director at the Open Markets Institute, a think-tank that studies corporate concentration.Before the pandemic, there had been scrutiny on Big Tech. The US House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee sent requests for information to Amazon, Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook in September 2019, with the government concerned that only a small number of companies hold such a big share of the digital market.Coronavirus may have delayed these investigations, but they will still be carried out.""Those focused on antitrust will renew their attention on big tech companies because we're in an election year [in the US] and both parties are going to want the attention on their efforts to regulate business,"" says Jonathan Osborne, a lawyer from Globalaw's law firm Gunster. Mr Vaheesan warns that in the US, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have not taken company acquisitions seriously enough - clearing the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp by Facebook, and YouTube by Google.He is not optimistic that the DoJ and the FTC will change their approach in the future.In the UK, Amazon's multi-million pound investment in Deliveroo was provisionally cleared by competition chiefs because the takeaway courier said it would collapse if it was blocked. A final ruling is due on 6 August. ""That was a one-off, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) looked at the market circumstances and saw them changing because of the pandemic, but the pandemic is not a reason for Big Tech companies to get away with scrutiny - absolutely not,"" says Jonathan Branton, head of competition at law firm DWF.The CMA has since announced it is investigating Facebook's acquisition of Giphy, the popular owner of a library of short animations and stickers used in social media.More Technology of BusinessBut is the current level of scrutiny enough, and will it change because of the pandemic?""It's hard to look into a crystal ball. I think Microsoft has taken a strong stance on trust, security and ethical use of AI, and while we've been focusing more on the crisis response in the short term, we still maintain and apply these principles and they will apply in the future. It's then about how public, industry and government look at that across the usage of Big Tech in the market,"" says Microsoft's Azure business lead Michael Wignall.Mr Vaheesan suggests that these major investigations into tech companies may not be what they seem.""It's too soon to say whether these are serious inquiries or whether they're merely a window dressing responding to the public and political concerns about the power of the big five tech companies.""In the US the picture is further complicated by President Trump's fraught relationship with Twitter.In May, for the first time, the company attached fact-check links to the President's tweets.That prompted a furious response from the White House with the President threatening to ""strongly regulate"" or even ""close down"" social media firms.Facebook has also been under pressure to remove comments made by the President, but has so far kept his posts up.To help protect their interests, the Big Tech firms have hundreds of lobbyists working in Washington.""When I meet with elected representatives in Washington DC, they're almost a bit bereft that there are more lobbyists than they have staffers to write this legislation,"" says Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at NYU Stern.""The budgets at DoJ and the FTC have been cut every year, so although there's more likely to be anti-trust action with a change in the White House, the question is whether the US government even has the resources anymore,"" says Mr Galloway. Mr Galloway believes that Europe is more likely to take the lead on tougher sanctions against Big Tech than the US. ""Europe gets all of the downside of big tech... but they get very little of the upside. In the US, these are tremendous economic engines, providing a lot of jobs and a source of pride - they create that ecosystem of other successful companies around them,"" he says.The European Commission announced two new antitrust investigations into Apple this week, while a recent Wall Street Journal report suggested that Amazon could be next on the EU's agenda, over its treatment of third party sellers.""It raises the question: why are we so dependent on a handful of large companies? Would we actually lose anything as a society if we had multiple online marketplaces? There's really nothing that compels us to accept the present structure of these markets,"" says Mr Vaheesan. Big tech may be getting stronger during the pandemic, but it may actually make things harder for them in the long term.Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Alphabet were asked for a response but declined to comment.

What Trump wants from global trade,"President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally. He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.  One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: ""We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible"". Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office. It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018. Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more. That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods. So a success for President Trump?  Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't. Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: ""If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.""President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods. There is an idea in economics known as the ""twin deficits hypothesis"", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services. It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.  So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.  That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an ""instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone"". But it's not true she says.Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers. ",28 November 2019,business
The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs,"US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.""It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war,"" says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.""When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive.""US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as ""dumping"".The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US ""at less than fair value"".As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.Mr Christopher likened it to ""playing whack-a-mole"", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.""Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,"" says Mr Christopher. ""So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.""Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.""We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,"" he says. ""It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.""To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.""Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,"" he says.""There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.""For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.""Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,"" adds Mr Vessey. ""But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.""Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.""They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,"" he says.""The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.""Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs ""are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game.""He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.""It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,"" says Mr Christopher.More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.""If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,"" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.""But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.""Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is ""not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief"".",21 November 2019,business
How China plans to lead the computer chip industry,"On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.""I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers,"" he says.His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm. In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware. ""Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power,"" says Mr Yue.""If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view,"" Mr Yue says.China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom. But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology. In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.""There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones,"" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.More Technology of Business""Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,"" Mr Scaruffi adds.Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies. Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.""To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features.  The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,"" says Mr Yue. He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.""You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has,"" says Mr Yue.Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs. ""We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers,"" he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. ""Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,"" says Mr Scaruffi. He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.""If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society,"" he says.

Is China gaining an edge in artificial intelligence?,"""China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing,"" says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead. The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies. It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.""What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era,"" said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for ""unfair"" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.Read more here.The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.""That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice,"" US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China. He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.""In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."" He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry. ""In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen.""Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans. In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.""Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them,"" he says. ""They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options.""More Technology of BusinessProf Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.""To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear.""While US concerns about technology theft have merit, ""I feel like we're over-reacting,"" says Prof Mitchell.""The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled,"" he says.American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.""Being hard on China is an easy political sell,"" he says, but warns that, ""I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways"".The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf. The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are ""de facto tools"" of the state's Communist Party, saying they ""have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally.""As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.""To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies,"" he says.For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

Former chancellor Sajid Javid warns against return to austerity,"Former chancellor Sajid Javid has warned against a return to austerity as the UK economy struggles with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. In a report by the Centre for Policy Studies, he called for low taxes on business to aid the UK's recovery.The conservative think tank, which was co-founded by Margaret Thatcher, said it should be based on ""a dynamic private sector and low taxes.""Labour has said the government should have offered more generous support.The report by the think tank said that a quick economic bounce back from the coronavirus crisis is is not likely.But it said coronavirus emergency spending measures should be stopped, if possible, by April 2021.It said that polls suggest the UK is ""not ready"" to return to austerity measures introduced by former chancellor George Osborne, ""necessary though they were"".Instead, the report calls for tax to shift away from profits and incomes and towards reformed property tax and tightening tax reliefs ""which unduly favour the wealthy"".National insurance should be given a ""significant temporary"" reduction to make it cheaper for employers to take on staff.The former cabinet minister, who resigned from the Treasury in February, said ""early hopes of a V-shaped recovery"" had ""proved optimistic"".He predicted that ""some long-term damage to the economy"" had become ""unavoidable"", with as many as 2.5 million people out of work due to the Covid-19 lockdown.But to speed up the rate of people re-entering employment, Mr Javid argued in the After The Virus report, published on Tuesday, that ministers must make it easier for businesses to hire workers.""If we want to support and stimulate employment, then axiomatically the best option is to cut the payroll tax - employer's National Insurance,"" Mr Javid said.""Tax employment less, and all other things being equal you will end up with more of it.""Other recommendations made in the report include temporarily cutting VAT and bringing forward ""shovel ready"" infrastructure projects, with Mr Javid arguing that the ""only way out of this crisis is growth"".He joins fellow former chancellor Alistair Darling in calling for an emergency VAT cut to boost consumer spending, a move undertaken by the Labour peer after the 2008 financial crisis.Mr Javid said: ""If we want to secure the strongest possible recovery, it's essential that no stone is left unturned.""The Labour Party, in a report in March on the economic effects of coronavirus, criticised the government for acting too slowly and said it should underwrite a bigger proportion of wages for those who lose their jobs",23 June 2020,business
Coronavirus: Pret a Manger job cut fears as sales plunge,"A leaked video revealing how sales have plunged at Pret a Manger during the coronavirus crisis has raised fears about job cuts at the sandwich chain. Boss Pano Christou told staff in a recent online meeting that an announcement about the ""job situation"" would be made on 8 July.He said Pret's global weekly takings had fallen to £3m, just 15% of what they would normally be.A Pret spokeswoman said staff would be the ""first to hear about any changes"".Pret stores in the UK, the US and France have been hit hard by lockdowns as office workers stayed in their homes.In May, Pret called in consultants to help renegotiate its rents as it attempted to avoid store closures, and said it was putting a ""clear plan"" in place to deal with reduced footfall.That plan could involve job cuts.In a recent video call to staff, which was leaked and shared on Twitter, Mr Christou discussed the ""job situation"":""What will be the case is, on 8 July, we'll be doing a broader communication to the teams, just talking through the initial work that's been done on this, so things will start to become clearer from 8 July,"" he said.A Pret spokeswoman said: ""As we have already confirmed, at the end of May we appointed advisers to help Pret develop a comprehensive transformation plan to adapt to the new retail environment.""""Transparency is very important in our business and we will make sure that Pret's team members are the first to hear about any changes. We will update our team members in early July once the plan has been finalised.""Restaurants and food chains have been hit hard by coronavirus lockdown measures.Last week bosses at restaurant and food chains including Wagamama and Pizza Hut warned Prime Minister Boris Johnson that the sector faces mass job cuts without more help.Although Pret has re-opened more than 300 stores in the UK, they are only offering takeaway or delivery services. The firm is trialling a click-and-collect service so customers can avoid queuing when demand returns. The video call indicated that sales were substantially down compared with normal figures, although improving as lockdown restrictions lift.When asked what sales Pret needed to make for the company to stop losing money, he said: ""I think globally we'll need our sales to get to about 60% [of pre-crisis levels] to break even.""""We're trying to aim to the month of September to get to that 60% but clearly there is a lot of work going into that from the team, but at the same time we're so dependent on footfall coming back into the cities to drive our sales up.""Mr Christou said the chain's US stores took close to $100,000 in sales in one week recently, a 98% drop from pre-crisis levels.In the same video, Pret's UK managing director, Clare Clough, said UK sales were down almost 90%.

Coronavirus: Energy firms permitted to chase unpaid bills again,"Energy companies have been given the go-ahead to chase unpaid energy bills again - although they have been warned not to be aggressive in their pursuit.Regulator Ofgem has told suppliers it is not in anyone's interests for an open-ended debt collection delay.Many households are benefitting from coronavirus-related payment holidays.But bailiffs have been banned from knocking on doors for another two months to collect other unpaid debts, such as parking fines or council tax.The government has said that the current restrictions on civil enforcement officers would continue until 24 August.Households struggling with their finances during the coronavirus outbreak have been able to negotiate help on their regular bills, such as mortgages, credit card repayments, and energy bills.Alongside this, energy companies paused their pursuit of any outstanding unpaid bills, but now the British energy regulator has said this could begin again assuming collection by companies or their agents is ""fair"".""We recognise that suppliers cannot extend unlimited credit to customers - nor is this in customers' interests overall - and we anticipate suppliers will begin to restart debt management activities that may have been paused during the immediate crisis,"" Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said in a letter to suppliers. He added that suppliers must take into account customers' ability to pay.""We will not tolerate sharp practice or aggressive debt collection and suppliers could face enforcement action where this is the case,"" he said.Wider debt collection still faces various restrictions, primarily through curbs on bailiffs.Councils, some of which suspended parking enforcement during lockdown, have returned to enforcing parking restrictions across much of the UK. Northern Ireland has traffic wardens back on the streets and fines will be issued again from 29 June.Meanwhile, a significant proportion of people making payments for unpaid taxes have continued to do so during lockdown.However, bailiffs - who are usually permitted to seize property or clamp vehicles to collect unpaid debts to local authorities - will see visits to people's homes restricted for another two months.The Civil Enforcement Association, which represents bailiffs, said it would comply with government regulations and ensure public health was not put at risk.However, it said a code of conduct for agents which had been drawn up in the expectation of an earlier return to work would probably need updating assuming further easing of restrictions such as social distancing.",22 June 2020,business
MPs to grill health officials on PPE spending,"MPs are to grill health officials on whether they overpaid for personal protective equipment to deal with coronavirus.The MP leading the inquiry says the crisis should not be an excuse for failing to achieve value for money.One focus of their interest could be a little-known pest control company which won a contract to supply PPE worth more than £100m.The government says it wants firms that can quickly provide a lot of PPE.PestFix, part of a company called Crisp Websites, signed the £109m contract with the government on 13 April to supply what were specified as ""urgently needed gloves, gowns and masks to the NHS supply chain.""The business operates from a unit by Littlehampton Marina on the West Sussex coast. Its accounts show that last year it had net assets of just £18,000.Yet officials sealed the deal with PestFix without putting the order out to other suppliers in a competitive tendering process, saying in the contract that because it was a matter of ""extreme urgency"" they were able to place the order ""without competing or advertising the requirement"".PestFix says it has delivered more than 67 million items of PPE into the NHS Supply Chain.""Our small, dedicated global team, spanning three continents, has worked non-stop for the past 70 days to support efforts of getting PPE to the front line involving an ongoing and herculean logistics operation,"" its director, Dan England, told BBC News.But the contract has added to concerns that in the scramble to get hold of vital equipment as the coronavirus situation deteriorated, the government may have paid too much.Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, would not comment on particular cases before taking evidence on Monday.But she said: ""Just getting numbers on its own isn't enough. You need to get value for money for the taxpayer, even in difficult times.""A hundred public sector contracts worth £342m had been signed for Covid-related PPE by the end of last month, according to the specialist data firm, Tussell.So nearly a third by value was accounted for by the single order to PestFix.One of the UK's most senior civil servants, the permanent secretary of the Cabinet Office, Alex Chisholm, told the committee last week that is was difficult to make value for money assessments in the current situation.""You'll find for PPE, ventilators and lots of other things we've purchased, that the per unit cost of buying things at great speed from multiple sources in a sellers' market has been higher than we would like to have paid,"" Mr Chisholm said.""So if you compared the average cost a year ago to what we've been paying now, it's been expensive"".But he said the spending was necessary and there was no alternative.The procurement process has been fraught with problems.A shipment in early May of more than 80 tonnes of protective gowns from Turkey was first delayed and then rejected by inspectors as faulty.Meg Hillier is incensed by the Turkish episode, saying ""We should not be paying money for old rope.""But small businesses say they have been doing their best to help in the country's hour of need.The next biggest contract for PPE, after PestFix, was granted to a marine supplies company near Salisbury, Ocean Footprint, which had been buying protective masks from China to sell to boatyards.Ocean Footprint agreed to supply the NHS with three million high grade masks for £5m. In the next few days it will have delivered more than a million of them.""I'm open about what we've done,"" says the managing director Peter Harrison, adding that it is easy to forget how anxious a time it was for health officials and suppliers as the deals were being struck.""It was desperate. It was all hands on deck. We hadn't even reached the peak.""The company knew that getting hold of enough masks in rivalry with other countries would be impossible, so it invested £100,000 in its own mask-making machine in order to be able to complete the order.The NHS could have bought similar masks much more cheaply before the crisis, Mr Harrison admits, but he says frantic worldwide demand, rising raw material costs and the need for air transport have sent prices spiralling upwards.He says that at the price he is selling to the government he could offload his entire stock to other buyers in a day.A not-for-profit campaign group, The Good Law Project, has announced that it will seek a judicial review of the decision to award PestFix with its PPE contract.The review would be to find out why there was no competition for the order and how the company was chosen.Dan England from PestFix says: ""We continue to work in close partnership with the NHS, MOD Procurement and DHSC Covid-19 procurement teams, who have all demonstrated incredible dedication in supporting PestFix to deliver this highly complex transaction.""A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""During this unprecedented global pandemic, we have been working around the clock to ensure PPE is delivered as quickly as possible to those on the frontline and we have delivered more than 1.7 billion items since the outbreak began.""We are prioritising companies that can provide large volumes of PPE at a fast pace, while ensuring all new PPE undergoes vigorous checks to ensure they meet the safety and quality required. We are grateful for all offers - some will be rejected based on these standards.""",21 June 2020,business
