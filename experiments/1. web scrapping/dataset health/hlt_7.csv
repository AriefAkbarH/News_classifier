Coronavirus vaccine: First evidence jab can train immune system,"The first hints that a vaccine can train people's immune system to fight coronavirus have been reported by a company in the US.Moderna said neutralising antibodies were found in the first eight people who took part in their safety trials. It also said the immune response was similar to that in people infected with the actual virus.Larger trials to see whether the jab protects against infection are expected to start in July.Work on a coronavirus vaccine has been taking place at unprecedented speed, with around 80 groups around the world working on them. Moderna was the first to test an experimental vaccine, called mRNA-1273, in people.  The vaccine is a small snippet of the coronavirus's genetic code, which is injected into the patient. It is not capable of causing an infection or the symptoms of Covid-19, but is enough to provoke a response from the immune system. The vaccine trials, run by the US government's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, showed the vaccine led to the production of antibodies which can neutralise the coronavirus.However, testing for these neutralising antibodies has only taken place on the first eight, out of 45, people on the trial. The people on the trial were taking either a low, middle or high dose. The highest dose was linked to most side-effects.However, Moderna said that even people taking the lowest dose had antibodies at the same levels seen in patients who recover from Covid-19.And antibodies ""significantly exceeded"" those in recovered patients for people on the middle dose.The study is known as a phase 1 trial as it is designed to test whether the vaccine is safe, rather then whether it is effective.It will take larger trials to see if people are protected against the virus. However, experiments on mice showed the vaccine could prevent the virus replicating in their lungs. ""These interim phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection,"" said Dr Tal Zaks, chief medical officer at Moderna.""These data substantiate our belief that mRNA-1273 has the potential to prevent Covid-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials.""Moderna said it was hoping to start a large-scale trial in July, and that it was already investigating how to manufacture the vaccine at scale.A vaccine pioneered by the University of Oxford is also being tested in people, but there are no results from those trials yet. However, concerns have been raised about the results of experiments in monkeys. Tests showed vaccinated animals had less severe symptoms and did not get pneumonia. However, they were not completely protected from the virus and signs of it were detected at the same level in the monkeys' noses as in unvaccinated animals.  Prof Eleanor Riley, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""If similar results were obtained in humans, the vaccine would likely provide partial protection against disease in the vaccine recipient but would be unlikely to reduce transmission in the wider community.""However, until human trials have been performed it is impossible to know how the vaccine will perform in people.

Coronavirus symptoms: UK adds loss of smell and taste to list,"Loss of smell or taste have been added to the UK's list of coronavirus symptoms that people should look out for and self-isolate with. Until now, only a fever and cough were triggers for people to shut themselves away in self-isolation in case they had and could spread the infection.  Ear, nose and throat doctors had been warning for weeks that more symptoms should be included. Scientific advisers told the government to update the advice. If you or someone you live with has any of these symptoms - a new, continuous cough, fever or loss of smell or taste (also called anosmia) - the advice is stay at home for seven days to stop the risk of giving coronavirus to others. Cough and loss of smell or taste can persist after seven days. You do not need to keep self-isolating after seven days, unless you have a high temperature or are unwell, says the advice. Loss of smell and taste may still be signs of other respiratory infections, such as the common cold. Experts say fever and cough remain important symptoms of coronavirus to look out for.Using an app, researchers at King's College London have gathered symptom information from over 1.5m people in the UK who believe they might have had coronavirus. They say there are even more symptoms - such as tiredness and stomach pain or diarrhoea - that could be included as possible coronavirus symptoms. Some other countries and the World Health Organization are already citing them.

Coronavirus: A third of hospital patients develop dangerous blood clots,"Up to 30% of patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus are developing dangerous blood clots, according to medical experts.They say the clots, also known as thrombosis, could be contributing to the number of people dying.Severe inflammation in the lungs - a natural response of the body to the virus - is behind their formation.Patients worldwide are being affected by many medical complications of the virus, some of which can be fatal.Back in March, as coronavirus was spreading across the globe, doctors started seeing far higher rates of clots in patients admitted to hospital than they would normally expect.And there have been other surprises, including the discovery of hundreds of micro-clots in the lungs of some patients.The virus has also increased cases of deep vein thrombosis - blood clots usually found in the leg - which can be life-threatening when fragments break off and move up the body into the lungs, blocking blood vessels.Artist Brian McClure was rushed to hospital last month suffering from the pneumonia brought on by coronavirus. But soon after he arrived, he had a scan showing he was in a bigger fight for his life. ""I went for a lung screening and that showed blood clots in the lungs. I was told that was very dangerous,"" he said. ""That was when I really started to get worried. I got the picture that if I didn't improve then I would be in serious trouble.""He is now continuing his recovery at home.""With a huge outpouring of data over the past few weeks I think it has become apparent that thrombosis is a major problem,"" says Roopen Arya, professor of thrombosis and haemostasis at King's College Hospital, London.""Particularly in severely affected Covid patients in critical care, where some of the more recent studies show that nearly half the patients have pulmonary embolism or blood clot on the lungs.""He believes the number of critically ill coronavirus patients developing blood clots could be significantly higher than the published data in Europe of up to 30%.The professor's blood sciences team in the hospital has been analysing samples from patients showing how coronavirus is changing their blood making it much more sticky. And sticky blood can lead to blood clots.This change in the blood is the result of severe inflammation in the lungs, a natural response of the body to the virus. ""In severely affected patients we are seeing an outpouring of chemicals in the blood and this has a knock-on effect of activating the blood clotting,"" says Prof Arya.And all this ultimately causes a patient's condition to deteriorate.According to thrombosis expert Prof Beverley Hunt, sticky blood is having wider repercussions than just blood clots - it's also leading to higher rates of strokes and heart attacks.""And yes sticky blood is contributing to high mortality rates,"" she says.To add to all these medical challenges, there are studies showing that the blood thinners currently being used to treat the blood clots are not always working. And ramping up doses to much higher levels risks patients suffering major bleeding which can be fatal.The balance between treating the thrombosis and causing bleeds is ""a precarious one"", according to Prof Arya.But there is now a big push to get medical teams from around the world to co-operate in finding the safest and most effective way of tackling the blood clot problem thrown up by the virus.Trials are under way to find a standard dosage of blood thinners to be used in all countries.However, some experts believe there could be another solution: finding a way to reduce the acute inflammation in the lungs which leads to the creation of sticky blood, the source of the problem.",16 May 2020,health
Coronavirus: Children affected by rare Kawasaki-like disease,"Scores of UK and US children have been affected by a rare inflammatory disease linked to coronavirus.In a tiny number of children it can cause serious complications, with some needing intensive care.Up to 100 children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in children elsewhere in Europe.It is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease.In April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children.This was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London, including a 14-year-old who died.They all had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain.Most of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues.Doctors are describing it as a ""new phenomenon"" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips.But this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications.Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked.""You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon,"" she said.This means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home.The syndrome is ""exceptionally rare"", he said.""This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown,"" Prof Viner added.He said understanding more about the inflammatory disease ""might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic"".Children are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital.Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies.""So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus,"" he said.However Prof Levin said there was ""a vast amount to learn"" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks.Children appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases.There have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands.At least 15 US states are looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo.Out of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week.Meanwhile, according to a study by doctors in northern Italy, 10 children have been affected by the disease.All 10 of the children in the study were admitted to a hospital in Bergamo - the city at the centre of the worst outbreak in Italy - between mid-February and mid-April, and recovered.The children, who had an average age of seven, tended to have severe symptoms such as heart complications and signs of toxic shock syndrome. They also needed additional treatment with steroids.In antibody tests on the children, eight appeared to have already had the coronavirus while the other two had not. But the researchers said the tests were not 100% accurate. Swab tests to detect the virus are not thought to be useful because the reaction tends to occur many weeks after infection.Dr Lucio Verdoni, report author and doctor at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, said: ""Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children.""Child health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children.They are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).

""In severely affected patients we are seeing an outpouring of chemicals in the blood and this has a knock-on effect of activating the blood clotting,"" says Prof Arya.And all this ultimately causes a patient's condition to deteriorate.According to thrombosis expert Prof Beverley Hunt, sticky blood is having wider repercussions than just blood clots - it's also leading to higher rates of strokes and heart attacks.""And yes sticky blood is contributing to high mortality rates,"" she says.To add to all these medical challenges, there are studies showing that the blood thinners currently being used to treat the blood clots are not always working.

Coronavirus: Children affected by rare Kawasaki-like disease,"Scores of UK and US children have been affected by a rare inflammatory disease linked to coronavirus.In a tiny number of children it can cause serious complications, with some needing intensive care.Up to 100 children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in children elsewhere in Europe.It is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease.In April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children.This was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London, including a 14-year-old who died.They all had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain.Most of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues.Doctors are describing it as a ""new phenomenon"" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips.But this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications.Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked.""You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon,"" she said.This means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home.The syndrome is ""exceptionally rare"", he said.""This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown,"" Prof Viner added.He said understanding more about the inflammatory disease ""might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic"".Children are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital.Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies.""So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus,"" he said.However Prof Levin said there was ""a vast amount to learn"" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks.Children appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases.There have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands.At least 15 US states are looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo.Out of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week.Meanwhile, according to a study by doctors in northern Italy, 10 children have been affected by the disease.All 10 of the children in the study were admitted to a hospital in Bergamo - the city at the centre of the worst outbreak in Italy - between mid-February and mid-April, and recovered.The children, who had an average age of seven, tended to have severe symptoms such as heart complications and signs of toxic shock syndrome. They also needed additional treatment with steroids.In antibody tests on the children, eight appeared to have already had the coronavirus while the other two had not. But the researchers said the tests were not 100% accurate. Swab tests to detect the virus are not thought to be useful because the reaction tends to occur many weeks after infection.Dr Lucio Verdoni, report author and doctor at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, said: ""Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children.""Child health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children.They are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).

Coronavirus symptoms: UK adds loss of smell and taste to list,"Loss of smell or taste have been added to the UK's list of coronavirus symptoms that people should look out for and self-isolate with. Until now, only a fever and cough were triggers for people to shut themselves away in self-isolation in case they had and could spread the infection.  Ear, nose and throat doctors had been warning for weeks that more symptoms should be included. Scientific advisers told the government to update the advice. If you or someone you live with has any of these symptoms - a new, continuous cough, fever or loss of smell or taste (also called anosmia) - the advice is stay at home for seven days to stop the risk of giving coronavirus to others. Cough and loss of smell or taste can persist after seven days. You do not need to keep self-isolating after seven days, unless you have a high temperature or are unwell, says the advice. Loss of smell and taste may still be signs of other respiratory infections, such as the common cold. Experts say fever and cough remain important symptoms of coronavirus to look out for.Using an app, researchers at King's College London have gathered symptom information from over 1.5m people in the UK who believe they might have had coronavirus. They say there are even more symptoms - such as tiredness and stomach pain or diarrhoea - that could be included as possible coronavirus symptoms. Some other countries and the World Health Organization are already citing them. Lead researcher Prof Tim Spector said: ""We list about 14 symptoms which we know are related to having a positive swab test.""These are not being picked up by the NHS. This country is missing them all and not only underestimating cases but also putting people at risk and continuing the epidemic.""There's no point telling people to be alert if they don't know the symptoms.""Prof Nirmal Kumar from ENT UK, the body that represents ear, nose and throat doctors, said the change was ""better late than never"". ""We had been asking for this almost eight weeks ago. The delay has not helped at all. Many, many people have contacted us with concerns about loss of smell and taste and whether these are symptoms they should act upon.""England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said it was important to update advice at the right time ""when we think it's going to make a difference moving forwards to how we pick up cases"".Downing Street said the UK's chief medical officers were continually reviewing symptoms of the virus based on advice from experts.""They are now confident that encouraging self-isolation with a loss of sense of smell or taste will pick up slightly more cases and help to further control the spread of the virus,"" the prime minister's official spokesman said.The World Health Organization says along with the most common symptoms of fever, cough and tiredness, people may have: On Monday, the Department for Health and Social Care announced 160 new deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19. The overall UK death toll remains the highest in Europe, and was at 34,796 as of 17:00 BST on Sunday.In other developments:",18 May 2020,health
Coronavirus: Trump accuses WHO of being a 'puppet of China',"President Donald Trump has lashed out again at the UN's health body by labelling it a ""puppet of China"".The comment came hours after the US said the World Health Organization (WHO) had let Covid-19 spin ""out of control"" at the cost of ""many lives"".""There was a failure by this organisation to obtain the information that the world needed,"" US Health Secretary Alex Azar said on Monday.Mr Azar made the comments in an address to the UN's World Health Assembly.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus earlier agreed to a review over the agency's handling of the pandemic.Dr Tedros said an independent evaluation, which would look at what lessons could be learned and put forward any recommendations, would take place ""at the earliest opportunity"".The two-day assembly - an annual meeting involving 194 member states of the WHO that reviews the work of the UN's health agency - comes amid recriminations between the US and China over the virus.US President Donald Trump, who faces re-election this year and has been criticised for his handling of the pandemic, has blamed China for trying to cover up the outbreak and has accused the WHO of failing to hold Beijing to account.""I chose not to make a statement today,"" Mr Trump said on Monday about the event, while describing the body as ""China-centric"" and ""a puppet of China"".He said the WHO had ""gave us a lot of very bad advice, terrible advice"" and were ""wrong so much and always on the side of China"". The president later shared a letter he sent to Dr Tedros, outlining specific issues the US has regarding the WHO's response.The detailed correspondence sets out a limit of 30 days for the body to commit to ""substantive improvements"" or risk Mr Trump's temporary freeze of US funding becoming permanent.Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has defended China's actions during the outbreak, said at Monday's virtual meeting that his country had acted ""with openness and transparency"" and insisted that any investigation should happen after the pandemic was brought under control. He added that China would provide $2bn (£1.6bn; €1.8bn) over two years in aid to nations around the world in the wake of the pandemic and offered to share any vaccine as soon as one became available. White House National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot described the move as ""a token to distract from calls... demanding accountability for the Chinese government's failure to meet its obligations"". Meanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the WHO must be given more legal powers to ensure that countries report outbreaks and share data.""A novel infectious disease could emerge at any time and we must be able to respond more quickly and effectively,"" he said. More than 4.5 million people have been infected and more than 300,000 have died since the virus emerged in China in December.Analysis by Tulip Mazumdar, BBC global health correspondentAfter a good four hours of countries pledging their support for the WHO, the US took just three minutes to launch a scathing attack on the UN's health agency. The US didn't specifically name China, but talked about ""at least one member state's apparent attempt"" to ""conceal this outbreak"", and said the WHO ""must become far more transparent and far more accountable"". Meanwhile, South Korea and Australia said the assembly should consider giving the WHO more powers, with Australia specifically pointing to greater ""inspection powers"". There have been calls for the agency to be mandated to go into countries very early in outbreaks, to carry out independent investigations.  China has said it supports a ""comprehensive evaluation"" of the global response, but only after the virus is contained. That could take months - or even years.The European Union, alongside countries including the UK, Australia and New Zealand, has been pushing for an inquiry into how the pandemic has been handled and what lessons can be learned.EU spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson said several key questions needed to be answered as part of any review.""How did this pandemic spread? What is the epidemiology behind it? All this is absolutely crucial for us going forward to avoid another pandemic of this kind,"" she said.However, she added that now was not the time for ""any sort of blame game"". A draft resolution calling for a review, to be put to a vote on Tuesday, requires a two-thirds majority to pass.Last month, an EU report accused China of spreading disinformation about the crisis.The bloc's External Action Service said Russia, and to a lesser extent China, had promoted ""conspiracy narratives"".Separately, member states agreed on Monday to delay discussions over granting Taiwan observer status for assembly meetings, with Taipei saying that it would defer its demand until later in the year.China, which says Taiwan is part of its territory, has blocked Taiwan's attendance since 2016. In recent weeks, the US, EU, Japan and several other nations have backed Taiwan's bid to attend the meeting.During Monday's talks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said excluding Taiwan ""further damages"" the credibility of the WHO.The outbreak first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and was widely reported to have originated in a food market.Since then, however, some senior US politicians have suggested that the source was a research facility in Wuhan that had been carrying out research on bat coronaviruses. China has dismissed the idea.Mr Pompeo said earlier this month that there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the virus came from a laboratory in Wuhan. However, in a TV interview with Breitbart on Saturday he appeared to step back, saying ""we know it began in Wuhan, but we don't know from where or from whom"".The draft resolution mentions identifying ""the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts"".Last month, senior Chinese diplomat Chen Wen told the BBC that demands for an investigation were politically motivated and that such a move would only divert attention and resources away from fighting the virus.",19 May 2020,health
Coronavirus: A third of hospital patients develop dangerous blood clots,"Up to 30% of patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus are developing dangerous blood clots, according to medical experts.They say the clots, also known as thrombosis, could be contributing to the number of people dying.Severe inflammation in the lungs - a natural response of the body to the virus - is behind their formation.Patients worldwide are being affected by many medical complications of the virus, some of which can be fatal.Back in March, as coronavirus was spreading across the globe, doctors started seeing far higher rates of clots in patients admitted to hospital than they would normally expect.And there have been other surprises, including the discovery of hundreds of micro-clots in the lungs of some patients.The virus has also increased cases of deep vein thrombosis - blood clots usually found in the leg - which can be life-threatening when fragments break off and move up the body into the lungs, blocking blood vessels.Artist Brian McClure was rushed to hospital last month suffering from the pneumonia brought on by coronavirus. But soon after he arrived, he had a scan showing he was in a bigger fight for his life. ""I went for a lung screening and that showed blood clots in the lungs. I was told that was very dangerous,"" he said. ""That was when I really started to get worried.

Coronavirus: Diabetic people offered support,"People with diabetes are being offered help and support as a study reveals some people with the condition may be at higher risk if they catch coronavirus. Although the threat of coronavirus is still low for most diabetic people, diabetes was linked to a third of virus deaths in England from 1 March to 11 May, NHS England research shows.  High blood sugar levels and obesity add to the risk. But age is a bigger risk factor.People with type 1 or 2 diabetes are strongly advised to follow the government's coronavirus advice. Diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home, although some may be advised to shield if they are at significant risk due to a combination of health factors.There is a helpline and online advice which people with diabetes can use to help manage their condition during the coronavirus outbreak. Assessing individual coronavirus risk is important. Someone might have underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, and still be very fit and only experience mild symptoms if they catch coronavirus. Research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 diabetes is very low.Some people may have other risk factors - such as heart disease or high blood pressure and obesity as well as diabetes - which would put them at much higher risk of complications. Age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus, say experts. Data shows: Prof Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity and lead author of the study said: ""This can be worrying news but we would like to reassure people that the NHS is here for anyone with concerns about diabetes - and has put extra measures in place to help people and keep them safe.""Bridget Turner from Diabetes UK said: ""This new data sheds much-needed light on which groups of people with diabetes are more likely to experience poor outcomes if they catch coronavirus. ""It's very important to remember that the risk of dying from coronavirus - for people with and without diabetes - remains very low, and that as cases of coronavirus decline, the risk to everyone of catching the disease will reduce in turn. ""The most important thing anyone with diabetes can do is try their best to manage their condition carefully, keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible. All people with diabetes should also follow stringent social distancing measures to reduce their chances of catching the virus altogether.""

Coronavirus: Cancer surgery delays risk 'thousands' of deaths,"The NHS must ensure cancer-surgery delays do not cost more lives than the number of Covid-19 patients saved, the Institute of Cancer Research says.In some cancers, a three-month delay could make the difference between a tumour being curable or not, Prof Clare Turnbull said.And her modelling suggested delaying surgery risked thousands of additional deaths. NHS England is already urging people to seek help for worrying symptoms.Cancer doctors have told BBC News of having to make difficult decisions to postpone some patients' care during the coronavirus crisis.But by the end of April, cancer referrals had dropped by an estimated 70%.And as normal service resumed, the NHS should prioritise ""certain cancer types in particular"", Prof Turnbull said.Lung and colorectal cancers, for example, were particularly fast moving.But for others, such as prostate and certain breast cancers, treatment could more safely be delayed.For every 10 Covid-19 patients whose lives were saved in hospital, four cancer patients could die, according to the ICR study, if all tumour-removal surgeries are delayed by six months. Every year, there are 95,000 operations to remove common cancers in adults in England.And more than 80,000 of these patients go on to survive for at least five years. But a three-month delay would lead to almost 5,000 excess deaths. And a six month delay could lead to almost 11,000. Trusts have been told all essential cancer treatments must continue despite the NHS focus on coronavirus.An NHS England official said: ""Vital tests and treatments are going ahead in a safe way for thousands of patients, including by introducing Covid-protected cancer hubs.""The NHS has now set out guidance so that hospitals can further increase the number of cancer tests and treatments they carry out, as well as having the extra capacity to treat future coronavirus patients.""So our message to anyone worried about symptoms is, 'Help us help you, and seek help as you always would.'"" But cancer charity Macmillan said some planned treatment may have to be delayed or moved to a different hospital.And some patients would be given chemotherapy or hormonal therapy instead of surgery for an interim period.Follow Rachel on Twitter",20 May 2020,health
