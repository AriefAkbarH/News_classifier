Coronavirus: South Asian people most likely to die in hospital,"South Asian people are the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital in Great Britain, major analysis shows. It is the only ethnic group to have a raised risk of death in hospital and is partly due to high levels of diabetes. The study is hugely significant as it assessed data from four-in-10 of all hospital patients with Covid-19.The researchers said policies such as protecting people at work and who gets a vaccine may now need to change.Twenty-seven institutions across the UK,  including universities and public health bodies, as well as 260 hospitals, were involved in the study.The findings have been made public online ahead of being formally published in a medical journal. However, the results were passed onto the UK government's scientific advisory group - Sage - more than a month ago.The study tells us only what happens once somebody is admitted to hospital, not whether they were more likely to catch the virus.It looked at nearly 35,000 Covid-19 patients in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales up until the middle of May.""South Asians are definitely more likely to die from Covid-19 in hospital, but we don't see a strong effect in the black group,"" Prof Ewen Harrison, from the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC. People from South Asian backgrounds were 20% more likely to die than white people. Other minority ethnic groups did not have a higher death rate. The study, the largest of its type in the world, shows:The study also reveals profound differences in who is needing hospital care based on ethnicity. ""The South Asian population in hospital looks completely different to the white population,"" Prof Harrison said.He added: ""They're 12 years younger on average, that's a massive difference, and they tend not to have dementia, obesity or lung disease, but very high levels of diabetes."" Around 40% of South Asian patients had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes compared with 25% of white groups.Diabetes has a dual effect of increasing the risk of infection and damaging the body's organs, which may affect the ability to survive a coronavirus infection. This is thought to be a major factor in increasing the death rate in people of South Asian ethnicity, but the full picture has not yet been uncovered.Other explanations could include poverty or subtle genetic differences that increase the risk of serious infection, the researchers say.The report says ethnicity may now need to be considered alongside age and other health issues when deciding who gets a vaccine if one becomes available. The same issue crops up in deciding who should be shielding and whether some people need extra protection in the workplace. ""It does have far-reaching implications that are difficult to grapple with,"" Prof Harrison told the BBC.""Should there be a different policy for a frontline South Asian nurse to a white nurse - that's what's really tricky.""The study showed all ethnic minorities were more likely to need intensive care than people from white backgrounds. This may be partly due to the disease becoming more severe. However, another factor is white people were older and sicker so ventilation in intensive care may not be an option. The differences, however, were not about access to healthcare.The report showed that all ethnicities arrived in hospital in roughly the same stage of Covid-19 suggesting there is no delay in getting help between ethnicities.Earlier work by Public Health England showed people of Bangladeshi heritage were dying at twice the rate of white people, while other black, Asian and minority ethnic groups had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death. Although that did not account for other factors such as occupation, health problems and obesity.Meanwhile, work by Queen Mary University of London has suggested heart disease and vitamin D levels do not explain the increased risk of coronavirus in black, Asian and minority ethnic people. Both had been suggested as potential explanations for the greater risk in some groups.The researchers used data from the UK Biobank study. It is following people throughout their lives, including during the pandemic, and has detailed personal and medical information on people taking part.It did not look at deaths, rather who was testing positive for the virus in hospital. Their study, published in the Journal of Public Health, showed weight, poverty and crowded homes all contributed to a higher chance of having the virus. Researchers Dr Zahra Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Steffen Petersen told the BBC: ""Although some of the factors we studied appeared important, none of them adequately explained the ethnicity differences."" Even after taking them into account, people from ethnic minorities were still 59% more likely to test positive than those from white backgrounds and the reason remains unknown.Dr Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Petersen added: ""This is a really important question and one that we need to address urgently. ""There are a wide range of possible explanations including sociological, economic, occupational and other biological factors such as different genetic susceptibilities that need to be considered.""

Coronavirus: Dexamethasone proves first life-saving drug,"A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus.The low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone is a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly virus, UK experts say. The drug is part of the world's biggest trial testing existing treatments to see if they also work for coronavirus. It cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth.Had the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say.And it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients.The UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate ""a remarkable British scientific achievement"", adding: ""We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak.""Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world.About 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. Of those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. And these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. The drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions.And it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. This over-reaction, a cytokine storm, can be deadly. In the trial, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. For patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. For patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%.Chief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: ""This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough.""Lead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for:""There is a clear, clear benefit,"" he said.""The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about £5 per patient. ""So essentially it costs £35 to save a life. ""This is a drug that is globally available.""When appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said.But people should not go out and buy it to take at home. Dexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. The Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently been ditched amid concerns it increases fatalities and heart problems. The antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is already being made available on the NHS. The first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid.  That is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. And that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. Dexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.Half of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact.  The drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. So far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola.  That has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11.But the evidence was not strong enough to show whether it reduced mortality. Unlike dexamethasone, remdesivir is a new drug with limited supplies and a price has yet to be announced.  ",16 June 2020,health
Flushing 'can propel viral infection 3ft into air',"Flushing the toilet with the lid up creates a cloud of spray that can be breathed in and may spread infection, such as coronavirus, say researchers.Chinese scientists calculate that flushing can propel a plume of spray up and out of the toilet bowl, reaching head height and beyond. Droplets can travel up to 3ft - or 91cm - from ground level, according to the computer model used by the scientists from Yangzhou University. Shutting the lid would avoid this.The work is published in the journal Physics of Fluids. Coronavirus is spread through airborne droplets from coughs and sneezes, or objects that are contaminated with them. People who are infected can also have traces of the virus in their faeces, although it is not yet clear whether this might be another way to pass the disease on to others. Scientists around the world are testing sewage and wastewater to determine how some people might have become infected with coronavirus.Other viruses can be spread by poor toilet hygiene, known as faecal-oral transmission. As water pours into the toilet bowl during a flush, it strikes the side, creating turbulence and droplets. The droplets are so small they typically float in the air for more than a minute, according to study author Ji-Xiang Wang and colleagues from Yangzhou University, China. Dr Bryan Bzdek, from the Bristol Aerosol Research Centre at the University of Bristol, said although there was no clear evidence that coronavirus might spread in this way, it made sense to take precautions.""The study authors suggest that, whenever possible, we should keep the toilet seat down when we flush, clean the toilet seat and any other contact areas frequently, and wash our hands after using the toilet. ""While this study is unable to demonstrate that these measures will reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many other viruses are transmitted though the faecal-oral route, so these are good hygiene practices to have anyway.""",16 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: Blood clots targeted in treatment trial,"Scientists are to test whether an experimental drug can prevent potentially deadly blood clots associated with Covid-19.The trial, funded by the British Heart Foundation, will test the theory the clots are caused by a hormone imbalance triggered by coronavirus infection.It will become one of several drugs currently being trialled to prevent the disease's worst effects.  A third of hospitalised coronavirus patients develop dangerous blood clots. The drug, TRV027, works to rebalance hormones involved in blood pressure, water and salt. Scientists from Imperial College London, involved in the trial, think that when the virus enters the body, it uses an enzyme as a ""handle"" to enter the cells. But this disables the enzyme, which plays an important role in balancing the key hormones. When out of balance, the blood can become sticky, leading to clots.They theorise that TRV027 - which won its creator a Nobel Prize in 2012 - can step in to play this rebalancing role.Many of the treatments being trialled to treat Covid-19 focus on the body's inflammatory response. But the hormonal imbalance is a ""quite distinct problem"" which may provide clues to the question of why some people get severely ill why others do not, says Dr David Owen, one of the study's leads.Blood clotting could also explain why Covid-19 seems to particularly affect people who already have cardiovascular disease despite being a respiratory illness, according to the British Heart Foundation.Since Covid-19 is such a complex disease which effects many of the body's systems, this treatment could be used in combination with other drugs says Dr Kat Pollock, a joint lead on the study. About 60 patients will be given either the new experimental drug, or a placebo, starting next month. It has been shown to be safe in patients with acute heart failure, although it was not effective as a treatment for this condition.  TRV027 is just one of several different drugs being trialled to ease the disease's worst effects or help the body fight it off. At least 10 different antiviral drugs including HIV treatment lopinavir/ritonavir are being, or have been trialled to see if they can help fight off the disease.None has yet been shown to be effective on its own, although there is still hope several could be used together to shorten patients' illnesses. Remdesivir, a drug that has shown promising effects, works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs in order to replicate inside body cells.Meanwhile plasma - the liquid part of blood - taken from people who have recovered from coronavirus might also help, by giving sick people who haven't recovered the right antibodies to fight it off. And a number of other treatments are focusing on the body's dangerous inflammatory response to fighting Covid-19, known as cytokine release syndrome. Follow Rachel on Twitter",15 June 2020,health

The differences, however, were not about access to healthcare.The report showed that all ethnicities arrived in hospital in roughly the same stage of Covid-19 suggesting there is no delay in getting help between ethnicities.Earlier work by Public Health England showed people of Bangladeshi heritage were dying at twice the rate of white people, while other black, Asian and minority ethnic groups had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death. Although that did not account for other factors such as occupation, health problems and obesity.Meanwhile, work by Queen Mary University of London has suggested heart disease and vitamin D levels do not explain the increased risk of coronavirus in black, Asian and minority ethnic people. Both had been suggested as potential explanations for the greater risk in some groups.The researchers used data from the UK Biobank study. It is following people throughout their lives, including during the pandemic, and has detailed personal and medical information on people taking part.It did not look at deaths, rather who was testing positive for the virus in hospital. Their study, published in the Journal of Public Health, showed weight, poverty and crowded homes all contributed to a higher chance of having the virus. Researchers Dr Zahra Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Steffen Petersen told the BBC: ""Although some of the factors we studied appeared important, none of them adequately explained the ethnicity differences."" Even after taking them into account, people from ethnic minorities were still 59% more likely to test positive than those from white backgrounds and the reason remains unknown.Dr Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Petersen added: ""This is a really important question and one that we need to address urgently. ""There are a wide range of possible explanations including sociological, economic, occupational and other biological factors such as different genetic susceptibilities that need to be considered.""

Coronavirus: Dexamethasone proves first life-saving drug,"A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus.The low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone is a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly virus, UK experts say. The drug is part of the world's biggest trial testing existing treatments to see if they also work for coronavirus. It cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth.Had the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say.And it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients.The UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate ""a remarkable British scientific achievement"", adding: ""We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak.""Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world.About 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. Of those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. And these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. The drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions.And it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. This over-reaction, a cytokine storm, can be deadly. In the trial, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. For patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. For patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%.Chief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: ""This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough.""Lead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for:""There is a clear, clear benefit,"" he said.""The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about £5 per patient. ""So essentially it costs £35 to save a life. ""This is a drug that is globally available.""When appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said.But people should not go out and buy it to take at home. Dexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. The Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently been ditched amid concerns it increases fatalities and heart problems. The antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is already being made available on the NHS. The first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid.  That is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. And that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. Dexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.Half of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact.  The drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. So far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola.  That has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11.But the evidence was not strong enough to show whether it reduced mortality. Unlike dexamethasone, remdesivir is a new drug with limited supplies and a price has yet to be announced.  ",16 June 2020,health
Flushing 'can propel viral infection 3ft into air',"Flushing the toilet with the lid up creates a cloud of spray that can be breathed in and may spread infection, such as coronavirus, say researchers.Chinese scientists calculate that flushing can propel a plume of spray up and out of the toilet bowl, reaching head height and beyond. Droplets can travel up to 3ft - or 91cm - from ground level, according to the computer model used by the scientists from Yangzhou University. Shutting the lid would avoid this.The work is published in the journal Physics of Fluids. Coronavirus is spread through airborne droplets from coughs and sneezes, or objects that are contaminated with them. People who are infected can also have traces of the virus in their faeces, although it is not yet clear whether this might be another way to pass the disease on to others. Scientists around the world are testing sewage and wastewater to determine how some people might have become infected with coronavirus.Other viruses can be spread by poor toilet hygiene, known as faecal-oral transmission. As water pours into the toilet bowl during a flush, it strikes the side, creating turbulence and droplets. The droplets are so small they typically float in the air for more than a minute, according to study author Ji-Xiang Wang and colleagues from Yangzhou University, China. Dr Bryan Bzdek, from the Bristol Aerosol Research Centre at the University of Bristol, said although there was no clear evidence that coronavirus might spread in this way, it made sense to take precautions.""The study authors suggest that, whenever possible, we should keep the toilet seat down when we flush, clean the toilet seat and any other contact areas frequently, and wash our hands after using the toilet. ""While this study is unable to demonstrate that these measures will reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many other viruses are transmitted though the faecal-oral route, so these are good hygiene practices to have anyway.""",16 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: Blood clots targeted in treatment trial,"Scientists are to test whether an experimental drug can prevent potentially deadly blood clots associated with Covid-19.The trial, funded by the British Heart Foundation, will test the theory the clots are caused by a hormone imbalance triggered by coronavirus infection.It will become one of several drugs currently being trialled to prevent the disease's worst effects.  A third of hospitalised coronavirus patients develop dangerous blood clots. The drug, TRV027, works to rebalance hormones involved in blood pressure, water and salt. Scientists from Imperial College London, involved in the trial, think that when the virus enters the body, it uses an enzyme as a ""handle"" to enter the cells. But this disables the enzyme, which plays an important role in balancing the key hormones. When out of balance, the blood can become sticky, leading to clots.They theorise that TRV027 - which won its creator a Nobel Prize in 2012 - can step in to play this rebalancing role.Many of the treatments being trialled to treat Covid-19 focus on the body's inflammatory response. But the hormonal imbalance is a ""quite distinct problem"" which may provide clues to the question of why some people get severely ill why others do not, says Dr David Owen, one of the study's leads.Blood clotting could also explain why Covid-19 seems to particularly affect people who already have cardiovascular disease despite being a respiratory illness, according to the British Heart Foundation.Since Covid-19 is such a complex disease which effects many of the body's systems, this treatment could be used in combination with other drugs says Dr Kat Pollock, a joint lead on the study. About 60 patients will be given either the new experimental drug, or a placebo, starting next month. It has been shown to be safe in patients with acute heart failure, although it was not effective as a treatment for this condition.  TRV027 is just one of several different drugs being trialled to ease the disease's worst effects or help the body fight it off. At least 10 different antiviral drugs including HIV treatment lopinavir/ritonavir are being, or have been trialled to see if they can help fight off the disease.None has yet been shown to be effective on its own, although there is still hope several could be used together to shorten patients' illnesses. Remdesivir, a drug that has shown promising effects, works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs in order to replicate inside body cells.Meanwhile plasma - the liquid part of blood - taken from people who have recovered from coronavirus might also help, by giving sick people who haven't recovered the right antibodies to fight it off. And a number of other treatments are focusing on the body's dangerous inflammatory response to fighting Covid-19, known as cytokine release syndrome. Follow Rachel on Twitter",15 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: What is dexamethasone and how does it work?,"An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19.  A UK trial showed the drug could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and it can be used in the NHS immediately. Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. This drug works by dampening down the body's immune system.Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off.  But sometimes the immune system goes into overdrive and it's this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body's own cells.Dexamethasone calms this effect. It's only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell.The drug does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford.It's testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19.About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days.Their progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment.Scientists hope dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further.It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply.The UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial.The drug costs from £5.40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. It was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it's been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make the drug and it is widely available around the world. The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to the government's parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms.The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too.In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars.In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, the government has already been advised to use it to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support.Data from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions.The drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.Common side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention.Rarer side effects include eye disorders, blurred vision and haemorrhage.However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were ""no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population"".Prof Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. Trials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus-  were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not. ""It's been a huge ongoing debate,"" says Prof Horby.Scientists are trialling other steroids, such as methylprednisolone, in coronavirus patients with some promising early results.",18 June 2020,health
