Coronavirus: Hydroxychloroquine trial begins in the UK,"A trial to see whether two anti-malarial drugs could prevent Covid-19 has begun in Brighton and Oxford.Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or a placebo will be given to more than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.All the participants are staff who are in contact with Covid-19 patients.US President Donald Trump was criticised this week after he said he had been taking hydroxychloroquine, despite warnings it might be unsafe.The first UK participants in the global trial are being enrolled on Thursday at the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals and the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.  They will be given either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo for three months. At sites in Asia, participants will be given chloroquine or a placebo.These are the first of a planned 25 UK sites, with results expected by the end of the year. The trial is open to anyone delivering direct care to coronavirus patients in the UK, as long as they have not been diagnosed with Covid-19. It will test whether the drugs can prevent healthcare workers exposed to the virus from contracting it. One of the study's leaders, Prof Nicholas White at the University of Oxford said: ""We really do not know if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are beneficial or harmful against Covid-19.""But, he said, a randomised controlled trial such as this one, where neither the participant nor the researchers know who has been given the drug or a placebo, was the best way to find out. ""A widely available, safe and effective vaccine may be a long way off,"" said Prof Martin Llewelyn from Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who is also leading the study.  ""If drugs as well-tolerated as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could reduce the chances of catching Covid-19, this would be incredibly valuable."" The drugs can reduce fever and inflammation and are used as both a prevention and a treatment for malaria. Hydroxychloroquine regulates the body's immune response and is also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Lupus - an inflammatory disease caused by an overactive immune system. Lupus charities in the UK and US have raised concerns that demand for the drug associated with coronavirus could threaten the supply for patients who already rely on it. The drug gained attention after US President Donald Trump suggested it may be beneficial, and this week said he was taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus.The US Food and Drug Administration warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases, or clinical trials.While the University of Oxford trial is taking place in a controlled clinical environment, the World Health Organization has warned that some individuals were self-medicating and risked causing themselves serious harm.It has not yet been shown to be safe and effective in the prevention or treatment of coronavirus and can cause dangerous heart arrhythmias. The trial also involves researchers from the UK, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Italy. ",21 May 2020,health
Coronavirus vaccine: First evidence jab can train immune system,"The first hints that a vaccine can train people's immune system to fight coronavirus have been reported by a company in the US.Moderna said neutralising antibodies were found in the first eight people who took part in their safety trials. It also said the immune response was similar to that in people infected with the actual virus.Larger trials to see whether the jab protects against infection are expected to start in July.Work on a coronavirus vaccine has been taking place at unprecedented speed, with around 80 groups around the world working on them. Moderna was the first to test an experimental vaccine, called mRNA-1273, in people.  The vaccine is a small snippet of the coronavirus's genetic code, which is injected into the patient. It is not capable of causing an infection or the symptoms of Covid-19, but is enough to provoke a response from the immune system. The vaccine trials, run by the US government's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, showed the vaccine led to the production of antibodies which can neutralise the coronavirus.However, testing for these neutralising antibodies has only taken place on the first eight, out of 45, people on the trial. The people on the trial were taking either a low, middle or high dose. The highest dose was linked to most side-effects.However, Moderna said that even people taking the lowest dose had antibodies at the same levels seen in patients who recover from Covid-19.And antibodies ""significantly exceeded"" those in recovered patients for people on the middle dose.The study is known as a phase 1 trial as it is designed to test whether the vaccine is safe, rather then whether it is effective.It will take larger trials to see if people are protected against the virus. However, experiments on mice showed the vaccine could prevent the virus replicating in their lungs. ""These interim phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection,"" said Dr Tal Zaks, chief medical officer at Moderna.""These data substantiate our belief that mRNA-1273 has the potential to prevent Covid-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials.""Moderna said it was hoping to start a large-scale trial in July, and that it was already investigating how to manufacture the vaccine at scale.A vaccine pioneered by the University of Oxford is also being tested in people, but there are no results from those trials yet. However, concerns have been raised about the results of experiments in monkeys. Tests showed vaccinated animals had less severe symptoms and did not get pneumonia. However, they were not completely protected from the virus and signs of it were detected at the same level in the monkeys' noses as in unvaccinated animals.  Prof Eleanor Riley, from the University of Edinburgh, said: ""If similar results were obtained in humans, the vaccine would likely provide partial protection against disease in the vaccine recipient but would be unlikely to reduce transmission in the wider community.""However, until human trials have been performed it is impossible to know how the vaccine will perform in people.
