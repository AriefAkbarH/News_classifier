Coronavirus: Does the UK have the pandemic under control?,"Society is reopening. The long national hibernation - to quote Prime Minister Boris Johnson - is coming to an end with the biggest lifting of restrictions so far due to take place in England at the start of July. Lockdowns are also being eased in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, albeit at slightly different paces.It is a massive moment - and one certainly not without risk. There have been warnings it could lead to a second peak in infections. So how tight a grip does the UK have on coronavirus?Restrictions have to be lifted at some point. The big question is whether the UK is moving too soon.The number of infections has fallen dramatically. There are now just over 1,000 new cases a day on average. That compares with an estimated 100,000 at the peak at the end of March - we don't know the exact figure because there was only limited testing in place.Huge progress has, therefore, been made. But the number of infections is still significantly higher than in other countries. This certainly leaves the UK at higher risk of a second peak - and it is why there are plenty of experts, including former government chief scientific adviser Sir David King, voicing concern that restrictions are being eased too quickly. There are two factors that determine how quickly it will spread - the steps we take to reduce the risk of transmission and the ability of the test and trace system to contain local flare-ups.While restrictions are easing, there are still many measures being taken to disrupt the spread of the virus.Most are focused on continued social distancing and creating barriers between people whether that is via wearing face-coverings on public transport, stopping face-to-face seating in workplaces and introducing screens in shops.An unknown factor in reducing the risk of transmission is how quickly the public will embrace the new freedoms.Prof Lucy Yardley, an expert in public health psychology at the University of Bristol, believes people will be ""naturally cautious"", particularly those at higher risk.Where local outbreaks happen - and they certainly will - the ability of the test and trace systems to get a handle on the spread of infections will be crucial.There are separate systems in place in the four UK nations, although the basic principles are the same - a central team of call handlers and contact tracers, supported by local teams who can specialise in handling complex local cases and clusters.The prime minister promised a ""world-beating"" system. But it is clear we are not there yet despite a huge increase in testing and the launch of a contact tracing system in a pretty short period of time. Even Baroness Harding, the head of the service in England, admits it is not yet ""gold standard"" - for one thing the contact tracing app that complements the contact tracers is not ready and won't be for months.But the key question is whether it is good enough to contain outbreaks from now on.These systems are only a few weeks old, but have already been busy, tracing nearly 90,000 contacts in England alone. What is interesting is just how much contact tracing work gets devolved to local teams. The overwhelming majority of the contacts traced in England during the first two weeks were dealt with by councils and local Public Health England teams.An example of how this has worked can be seen in the West Yorkshire town of Cleckheaton.The system was alerted to a cluster of cases, which were then linked to a meat-packing factory in the town.Officials from Public Health England and the local council got involved, the factory was closed down and a mobile testing unit was dispatched to the area. Hundreds of staff at the factory are being tested - and only those who are negative are being allowed back as it reopens. Close contacts of those who have tested positive have been asked to isolate.Additional measures, including temperature checking and extra social distancing at work, are being introduced.All the signs are this flare-up was caught early - and there is real hope the measures taken have stopped the spread in its tracks.But the big risk in the future is what happens if these sort of measures do not work or if they are taken too late.A return to full lockdowns for local areas has been suggested. Germany, which has a much stronger track record of containing the virus than the UK, has just announced this for two districts.The UK would be very lucky if it did not have to take this step somewhere. In fact, there is already talk of a local lockdown in Anglesey after a spike in cases.The Association of Directors of Public Health, which represents council public health directors who are in charge of contact tracing at a local level, says this should be seen as part of a normal process of controlling the virus. The important thing is to avoid a big spike where the virus gets out of control.The ADPH would like to see better sharing of information by the national teams so they can keep an eye on who is testing positive and put more testing in place, particularly around care homes so staff and residents can get weekly testing.But if the system works as it should and continues to improve, a second runaway peak should be avoided, but only with the help of the public.Public adherence to the social distancing measures still in place and a willingness to co-operate with the contact tracing system - figures suggest one in four people who test positive do not engage with it - will be essential.The message is clear - we all have a role to play.Follow Nick on TwitterRead more from Nick",24 June 2020,health
Cancer drug: New treatment halts tumour growth,"A drug that could stop cancer cells repairing themselves has shown early signs of working. More than half of the 40 patients given berzosertib had the growth of their tumours halted.Berzosertib was even more effective when given alongside chemotherapy, the trial run by the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the Royal Marsden NHS Trust suggested.The trial was designed to test the safety of the drug.The drug is the first to be trialled of a new family of treatments, which block a protein involved in DNA repair.Blocking this protein prevents cancers from mending damage to their cells. It's part of a branch of treatment known as ""precision medicine"", which targets specific genes or genetic changes. The study involved patients with very advanced tumours, for whom no other treatment had worked. This was what is known as a ""phase one"" trial, which is only designed to test the safety of a treatment. But the ICR said the researchers did find some early indications that berzosertib could stop tumours growing.One of the study's authors, Prof Chris Lord, a professor of cancer genomics at the ICR, said these early signs were ""very promising"", adding that it was unusual in phase one trials to see a clinical response. Further trials will be needed to demonstrate the drug's effectiveness, though.  ""This study involved only small numbers of patients...Therefore, it is too early to consider berzosertib a game changer in cancer treatment,"" said Dr Darius Widera at the University of Reading.""Nevertheless, the unusually strong effects of berzosertib, especially in combination with conventional chemotherapy, give reasons to be optimistic regarding the outcomes of follow-up studies.""Philip Malling, a 62-year-old who was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2012, was enrolled on the trial after two years of unsuccessful chemotherapy. ""I was told 'there's nothing more we can do for you',"" he said. ""In April 2014, I was told 'you'll probably be dead by Christmas'"". He has now been receiving berzosertib treatment for six years, his tumours have shrunk and his condition is stable. ""It means everything,"" Mr Malling told the BBC. Another patient, whose ovarian cancer returned following a different course of treatment, saw her tumours shrink after combination treatment with the drug and chemotherapy.Chemotherapy works by damaging cancer cells' DNA, so using it in conjunction with this new treatment, which stops the cells from repairing themselves, appears to give an even greater benefit. And berzosertib is able to target tumour cells without affecting other healthy cells, Prof Lord said. ""Our new clinical trial is the first to test the safety of a brand-new family of targeted cancer drugs in people, and it's encouraging to see some clinical responses even in at this early stage,"" said Professor Johann de Bono, head of drug development at the ICR and the Royal Marsden.In the future, these drugs could be used to ""boost the effect of treatments like chemotherapy"" and tackle resistance that could develop to other targeted treatments, he added. Whereas the traditional approach to cancer treatment has been to categorise it by tumour site - breast cancer, lung cancer and so on - the precision-medicine approach targets the genetic abnormality in the tumour, regardless of where it is. Precision approaches are already used, for example in prostate cancers to block the effect of the testosterone hormone involved in the tumour's growth. If used alone this could provide a less aggressive option than chemotherapy, which attacks cells indiscriminately. The next phase of trialling berzosertib is already under way.

Coronavirus: What is dexamethasone and how does it work?,"An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19.  A UK trial showed the drug could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and it can be used in the NHS immediately. Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. This drug works by dampening down the body's immune system.Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off.  But sometimes the immune system goes into overdrive and it's this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body's own cells.Dexamethasone calms this effect. It's only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell.The drug does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford.It's testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19.About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days.Their progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment.Scientists hope dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further.It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply.The UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial.The drug costs from £5.40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. It was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it's been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make the drug and it is widely available around the world. The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to the government's parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms.The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too.In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars.In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, the government has already been advised to use it to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support.Data from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions.The drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.Common side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention.Rarer side effects include eye disorders, blurred vision and haemorrhage.However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were ""no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population"".Prof Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. Trials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus-  were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not. ""It's been a huge ongoing debate,"" says Prof Horby.Scientists are trialling other steroids, such as methylprednisolone, in coronavirus patients with some promising early results.",18 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: More than half wait too long for non-Covid tests,"The number of people in England waiting longer than six weeks for tests and scans increased five-fold between March and April. The Labour Party is calling for a plan to deal with this backlog in non-Covid services.NHS England's constitution says patients should wait no longer than six weeks for diagnostic tests. The government said new scanners and equipment had been provided as part of its coronavirus response. Figures published by NHS England this month showed almost 470,000 people had been waiting longer than six weeks for tests, including for cancer, at the end of April.That's five times as many as were waiting at the end of March.In February, before coronavirus took hold in the UK, fewer than 3% of people waited longer than six weeks.By April, more than half of people were waiting past the promised six-week cut off.Labour's Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth will bring forward a vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday, demanding a plan to deal with the built-up demand for care. ""A vital component would be the introduction of weekly routine testing of all NHS staff to keep them and patients safe from Covid-19 while receiving treatment,"" Mr Ashworth said.The increase in long waits varied by procedure.At the end of April, almost eight times as many people were waiting longer than six weeks for non-obstetric ultrasounds, compared with the end of March.Seven times as many people were waiting longer than recommended for a procedure used to detect bowel cancer, and six times as many for an ECG test, used to check heart rhythm.And long waits for CT and MRI scans, used in detecting a range of conditions including tumours, increased five-fold.Cancer Research has previously said more than two million people are now overdue for cancer screening, tests or treatment,  resulting in a potential 23,000 cancers having gone undiagnosed during lockdown.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We recognise the impact this global pandemic has had on NHS services and the challenges faced as we start to restore them in a safe way.""We will continue to ensure the NHS has everything it needs to provide the high quality care the public expect and we have already provided a significant number of new CT scanners, x-ray machines and portable ultrasounds as part of the response to Covid-19"". At the end of April the health service produced guidance on getting non-Covid services back up and running over a six-week period. That included steps like testing all patients having planned treatment before admission, and separating Covid and non-Covid patients into different areas. But at the beginning of June, health bosses warned it would not be possible to simply ""switch on"" NHS services immediately.The Royal College of Surgeons president Prof Derek Alderson last week told MPs ""Covid-light"" sites needed to be set up to allow other services to resume. That will involve testing all patients, and testing staff for coronavirus as often as twice as week, he said. ",24 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: What is a second wave and is one coming?,"Coronavirus is far from over. Some countries are still dealing with large epidemics, but even those currently controlling the virus fear ""the second wave"".In the UK, health experts are warning ministers to prepare for one following the decision to further ease restrictions in England from early July.The second phase of Spanish flu a century ago was deadlier than the first. So, is a second wave inevitable? And how bad could it be?You can think of it like waves on the sea. The number of infections goes up and then comes back down again - each cycle is one ""wave"" of coronavirus.Yet there is no formal definition.""It's not particularly scientific: how you define a wave is arbitrary,"" Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick, told the BBC. Some describe any rise as a second wave, but it is often a bumpy first wave. This is happening in some US states. In order to say one wave has ended, the virus would have been brought under control and cases fallen substantially.For a second wave to start you would need a sustained rise in infections. New Zealand, which has its first cases after 24 days without coronavirus, and Beijing, which is facing an outbreak after 50 virus-free days, are not in this position. But some scientists argue Iran may be starting to meet the criteria for a second wave.The answer lies almost entirely with the decisions we make, so it could go either way. ""I really think at the moment there's huge uncertainty... but to be honest it's something I'm very concerned about,"" says Dr Tildesley.The potential is clearly there - the virus is still around and it is no less deadly or infectious than at the start of 2020.Only around 5% of people in the UK are thought to have been infected and there is no guarantee they are all immune.""The evidence is the vast majority of people are still susceptible. In essence, if we lift all measures, we're back to where we were in February,"" says Dr Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.""It's almost like starting from scratch again.""Lifting lockdown restrictions too far.Lockdowns have caused massive disruption around the world - destroying jobs, affecting people's health and taking children out of school - but they have controlled the virus.""The ultimate puzzle is how to maintain control, while minimising daily disruption,"" says Dr Kucharski. Nobody is 100% sure how far we can go. That is why measures are being lifted in stages and new ways of controlling coronavirus are being introduced, such as contact tracing or face coverings. ""In the UK and neighbouring countries, flare-ups could happen quite quickly if measures are lifted beyond the point transmission is controlled,"" says Dr Kucharski. This is already starting in Germany, where hundreds of people have tested positive for the virus after an outbreak at an abattoir.It is not a major problem if clusters can be rapidly identified, local lockdowns introduced and spread of the virus stopped.Otherwise, they contribute to a second wave.South Korea, which has been widely praised for its handling of the coronavirus, has had to reimpose some restrictions because of such clusters. Something will have gone seriously wrong if it is. The value of R - the number of people each infected person passed the virus to on average - was 3 at the start of the pandemic.It meant the virus was spreading fast, but our behaviour has changed, we're social distancing, and it's hard to see how R will get that high again. Dr Kucharski told the BBC: ""No country is going to just lift everything and go back to normal.""Even countries without control of coronavirus - like Brazil and India - don't have an R of 3.0.""If cases did start to grow again, it is likely to be relatively slow. However, a second wave could, theoretically, still end up bigger than the first because so many people are still susceptible.""[But] if cases climb again, we can reintroduce lockdown to suppress a second wave. That's always an option available to us,"" says Dr Tildesley. Dr Kurcharski says local flare-ups could be seen in ""even the coming weeks or months"" as measures are lifted.But that does not mean a guaranteed second wave.Dr Tildesley says: ""If measures are relaxed significantly, we may end up with a second wave in late August or early September.""Winter may be a crucial time as other coronaviruses do spread more readily then. If we were only just controlling the virus, even a small seasonal boost could lead to the virus spreading.""Spring undoubtedly helped us,"" Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, says.""A second wave is almost inevitable, particularly as we go towards the winter months.""The challenge for government is to ensure the peak isn't so much that it overburdens the healthcare system.""One argument against a deadly second wave is that viruses become less dangerous as they evolve, to better infect people. Even HIV seems to be getting milder. The theory goes that viruses will spread further if they don't kill their host and so become milder.""But it's not guaranteed. It's a bit of a lazy thing some virologists trot out,"" says Prof Ball. It is also something that takes place over long periods of time. More than six months into the pandemic there is no clear evidence the virus has mutated to spread more easily or be less deadly. Prof Ball adds: ""I think the virus is doing very well at the minute. People often have very mild or symptomless infection. If they can transmit, then there is no reason to imagine coronavirus needs to become milder.""Follow James on Twitter",24 June 2020,health
