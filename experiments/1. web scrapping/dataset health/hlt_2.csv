Coronavirus: Children affected by rare Kawasaki-like disease,"Scores of UK and US children have been affected by a rare inflammatory disease linked to coronavirus.In a tiny number of children it can cause serious complications, with some needing intensive care.Up to 100 children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in children elsewhere in Europe.It is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease.In April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children.This was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London, including a 14-year-old who died.They all had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain.Most of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues.Doctors are describing it as a ""new phenomenon"" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips.But this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications.Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked.""You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon,"" she said.This means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home.The syndrome is ""exceptionally rare"", he said.""This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown,"" Prof Viner added.He said understanding more about the inflammatory disease ""might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic"".Children are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital.Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies.""So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus,"" he said.However Prof Levin said there was ""a vast amount to learn"" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks.Children appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases.There have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands.At least 15 US states are looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo.Out of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week.Meanwhile, according to a study by doctors in northern Italy, 10 children have been affected by the disease.All 10 of the children in the study were admitted to a hospital in Bergamo - the city at the centre of the worst outbreak in Italy - between mid-February and mid-April, and recovered.The children, who had an average age of seven, tended to have severe symptoms such as heart complications and signs of toxic shock syndrome. They also needed additional treatment with steroids.In antibody tests on the children, eight appeared to have already had the coronavirus while the other two had not. But the researchers said the tests were not 100% accurate. Swab tests to detect the virus are not thought to be useful because the reaction tends to occur many weeks after infection.Dr Lucio Verdoni, report author and doctor at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, said: ""Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children.""Child health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children.They are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).

Coronavirus: Mental health of NHS staff at long-term risk,"NHS staff are at risk of high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder if they don't get the right support as the coronavirus outbreak subsides, health service adviser Prof Neil Greenberg has said.For now there's a national focus on health and care workers.Public billboards praise them, millions turn out on the street for a weekly round of applause and volunteers have been rushing to help in any way they can.  But the height of the crisis is when many staff will be in coping mode. It's when things slow down - and the clapping stops - that, psychologists believe, the real risk of difficulties will arise. People may need months or even years of ""active monitoring"" of their mental health after things return to some semblance of normality, according to Prof Greenberg, a world-leading expert in trauma.The NHS in England is providing crisis support to its staff. But it hasn't produced a formal long-term plan to offer extra psychological services in the aftermath of the pandemic.  As the crisis passes its peak, there is an ""urgent"" need to work out how staff calling new NHS mental health hotlines can be referred on to specialist services, says Dr Michael Bloomfield who runs a traumatic stress clinic at University College London (UCL). The clinic was set up as a result of the King's Cross Station fire in 1987, which killed 31 people and injured 100, and specialises in helping people following events like terror attacks.Studies after the Sars outbreak found about 10% of health staff had PTSD, and many more had other signs of psychological distress. The British Psychological Society (BPS) points out that health workers are highly resilient people who are used to dealing with difficult and sometimes traumatic situations. But this current crisis has particular risk factors - including fear for staff's own and their families' health and the loss of informal support networks because of social distancing and working outside their usual teams. Dr Rony Berrebi, an intensive care consultant in London, says: ""People are scared. I think the fear factor is massive.""""Imagine going to work every day and coming back home knowing the virus could be in your hair, your clothes, your shoes, or you might be brewing it,"" he says. It's what happens after the trauma that is ""most predictive of what people will be like in terms of their mental health"",  according to Prof Greenberg. How well people are supported and how much stress they're put under as they try to recover can make or break whether someone manages well or develops far more serious difficulties including PTSD.""If we muck it up then that's going to make the trauma they've already had much more difficult to deal with,"" he says.At the height of the crisis, evidence suggests good leadership from managers and support from peers are the most helpful things. Psychologists expect the real demand for more structured mental health support to come later.Dr Julie Highfield, a clinical psychologist in an intensive care unit who is involved in putting together national guidance through the BPS, says she doesn't expect the NHS hotline to be used very much during the ""active period when everyone's just trying to cope moment to moment"". She is concerned to stress the NHS shouldn't see this lack of demand as a general lack of need.""What's really needed long-term is an 18-month to two-year recovery period,"" with access to counselling and trauma-focused therapy, she says. Some therapy can be accessed now through in-house psychological services - but provision across the UK is ""patchy"", says Dr Highfield. She would like the NHS to commit to a shared ""minimum response"".  Dr Berrebi says his hospital has in-house psychologists but thinks some of his colleagues are not aware that it's available or how to access it. He's made a music video to raise funds for counselling for front-line workers. Some resist comparing intensive care units to the battlefield. But Prof Greenberg, who has worked for decades with the military on the mental health of personnel, says NHS staff should be treated like soldiers after tours - with time off and a gradual return to normal work. National mental health director Claire Murdoch said NHS England is offering mental health care and support ""within trusts, and new text, online and telephone support services"".The Scottish government has launched a ""national wellbeing hub"" where staff can access online resources, which it says has been created by ""trauma and other specialists"". This is designed to ""respond to the current pandemic and to help provide long-term support to staff,"" a spokesperson said. Northern Ireland's plan outlines support for both the ""active"" phase and the ""recovery"" phase, including access to ""evidenced-based psychological therapies for those with ongoing difficulties"" and team-based reflection. While in Wales, £1m has been put aside to provide support services including for PTSD. A number of voluntary schemes have also been set up to provide therapy for NHS staff, in an attempt to fill the gaps. Some, like Project 5 and Frontline-19, require volunteers to be accredited, highly vetted and commit to a minimum number of sessions.But this commitment varies. Prof Greenberg says some voluntary schemes are really good, but the quality varies: ""Some follow evidence-based guidelines, but some are, to be fair very well-intentioned, but often not very well put together.""It would be quite dangerous to allow a proliferation of well-meaning charities, which might distract or detract people from going and getting the right care.""And people may not want to access these services now, but later - at which point well-meaning volunteers may well have had to return to their day jobs.Kate Perry, a psychologist volunteering for Frontline-19, says she is committed to providing free care in the longer-term: ""It's very clear - you take someone into practice and treat them as you would a paying client, for as long as they need it.""   Trauma experts are particularly concerned about schemes that offer just one session or those that do not carefully vet volunteers' qualifications. This would be a concern, Dr Bloomfield says, because ""some interventions can interfere with the natural healing process and make PTSD more likely"".Follow Rachel on Twitter",15 May 2020,health
