Coronavirus: A third of hospital patients develop dangerous blood clots,"Up to 30% of patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus are developing dangerous blood clots, according to medical experts.They say the clots, also known as thrombosis, could be contributing to the number of people dying.Severe inflammation in the lungs - a natural response of the body to the virus - is behind their formation.Patients worldwide are being affected by many medical complications of the virus, some of which can be fatal.Back in March, as coronavirus was spreading across the globe, doctors started seeing far higher rates of clots in patients admitted to hospital than they would normally expect.And there have been other surprises, including the discovery of hundreds of micro-clots in the lungs of some patients.The virus has also increased cases of deep vein thrombosis - blood clots usually found in the leg - which can be life-threatening when fragments break off and move up the body into the lungs, blocking blood vessels.Artist Brian McClure was rushed to hospital last month suffering from the pneumonia brought on by coronavirus. But soon after he arrived, he had a scan showing he was in a bigger fight for his life. ""I went for a lung screening and that showed blood clots in the lungs. I was told that was very dangerous,"" he said. ""That was when I really started to get worried. I got the picture that if I didn't improve then I would be in serious trouble.""He is now continuing his recovery at home.""With a huge outpouring of data over the past few weeks I think it has become apparent that thrombosis is a major problem,"" says Roopen Arya, professor of thrombosis and haemostasis at King's College Hospital, London.""Particularly in severely affected Covid patients in critical care, where some of the more recent studies show that nearly half the patients have pulmonary embolism or blood clot on the lungs.""He believes the number of critically ill coronavirus patients developing blood clots could be significantly higher than the published data in Europe of up to 30%.The professor's blood sciences team in the hospital has been analysing samples from patients showing how coronavirus is changing their blood making it much more sticky. And sticky blood can lead to blood clots.This change in the blood is the result of severe inflammation in the lungs, a natural response of the body to the virus. ""In severely affected patients we are seeing an outpouring of chemicals in the blood and this has a knock-on effect of activating the blood clotting,"" says Prof Arya.And all this ultimately causes a patient's condition to deteriorate.According to thrombosis expert Prof Beverley Hunt, sticky blood is having wider repercussions than just blood clots - it's also leading to higher rates of strokes and heart attacks.""And yes sticky blood is contributing to high mortality rates,"" she says.To add to all these medical challenges, there are studies showing that the blood thinners currently being used to treat the blood clots are not always working. And ramping up doses to much higher levels risks patients suffering major bleeding which can be fatal.The balance between treating the thrombosis and causing bleeds is ""a precarious one"", according to Prof Arya.But there is now a big push to get medical teams from around the world to co-operate in finding the safest and most effective way of tackling the blood clot problem thrown up by the virus.Trials are under way to find a standard dosage of blood thinners to be used in all countries.However, some experts believe there could be another solution: finding a way to reduce the acute inflammation in the lungs which leads to the creation of sticky blood, the source of the problem.",16 May 2020,health
Coronavirus: Children affected by rare Kawasaki-like disease,"Scores of UK and US children have been affected by a rare inflammatory disease linked to coronavirus.In a tiny number of children it can cause serious complications, with some needing intensive care.Up to 100 children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in children elsewhere in Europe.It is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease.In April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children.This was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London, including a 14-year-old who died.They all had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain.Most of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues.Doctors are describing it as a ""new phenomenon"" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips.But this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications.Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked.""You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon,"" she said.This means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home.The syndrome is ""exceptionally rare"", he said.""This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown,"" Prof Viner added.He said understanding more about the inflammatory disease ""might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic"".Children are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital.Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies.""So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus,"" he said.However Prof Levin said there was ""a vast amount to learn"" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks.Children appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases.There have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands.At least 15 US states are looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo.Out of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week.Meanwhile, according to a study by doctors in northern Italy, 10 children have been affected by the disease.All 10 of the children in the study were admitted to a hospital in Bergamo - the city at the centre of the worst outbreak in Italy - between mid-February and mid-April, and recovered.The children, who had an average age of seven, tended to have severe symptoms such as heart complications and signs of toxic shock syndrome. They also needed additional treatment with steroids.In antibody tests on the children, eight appeared to have already had the coronavirus while the other two had not. But the researchers said the tests were not 100% accurate. Swab tests to detect the virus are not thought to be useful because the reaction tends to occur many weeks after infection.Dr Lucio Verdoni, report author and doctor at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, said: ""Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children.""Child health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children.They are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).

Coronavirus doctor's diary: A super-spreading funeral that led to three deaths,"In March, before the lockdown began, the Hussain family held a big funeral in Bradford's central mosque. Tragically, many mourners fell ill with Covid-19, including the dead man's son, Mohammed. But while three family members died, Mohammed eventually pulled through, writes Dr John Wright of the Bradford Royal Infirmary.Being intubated and ventilated in intensive care turns out to be a long, rocky road. In Bradford, of the 49 Covid patients who have been admitted to our ICU so far, most have been placed on intubated ventilators. So far seven of these patients have come off ventilation. Mohammed Hussain, a criminal lawyer from Bradford, was one of the first. He is one of our success stories. The 51-year-old was unconscious for five weeks and was very disconcerted when he woke up in what looked like a science fiction film with everybody wearing visors and masks and gowns - he couldn't remember how he got there. He had entirely missed the month of April.""I remember them asking me to go on the Recovery trial to try certain drugs and I said 'Yes.' But that's my last memory until I was waking up weeks later,"" Mohammed told me.While under sedation, he dreamed that his family had experienced a terrorist attack. And when he came round he remained uneasy. ""There was some paranoia to begin with. I thought, 'These people are trying to trick me. What's going on, what's all this about?'""This kind of delirium is quite normal for patients who wake up from critical care, says ICU consultant Dr Debbie Horner, clinical director for the anaesthetics and intensive care department. ""It's common for patients to feel very suspicious and anxious about what's going on around them. You can understand it, people are telling you that it's more than a month later and everyone's wearing really strange clothes."" Usually it's possible to give people advance warning before they get intubated, but Mohammed deteriorated quickly. He fell ill in March, following the funeral of his father, Noor, who was in his 90s.  Noor Hussain had come over from Pakistan in the 1960s to work in the mills in Bradford. He raised his family here, but it was always his wish to be buried in Mirpur. ""He was an old soldier who fought in the Second World War, in Burma, and he was a very determined man. He wanted to be buried next to his brother in Pakistan and I honoured that wish for him,"" Mohammed told me. Noor Hussain died on 10 March. The funeral gathering started that afternoon. It is a very large and respected family, so people travelled from across the UK - about 600 came to pay tribute at Bradford's Central Mosque on the first day. The following day Mohammed flew to Pakistan with his father's body - his mum and his wife went with him. But back in Bradford, the funeral continued for another two days. On Thursday 12 March, 500 mourners came and shared a meal.About a week later, people began to fall ill with Covid-19. The first was Mohammed's cousin's 24-year-old son - one of the first Covid patients in Bradford to be admitted to ICU. Three further members of that household also developed symptoms, one of them also going to hospital. And other relatives were hospitalised too, both in Bradford and Oldham.It seems clear that someone at the funeral - possibly one of the mourners from Bradford, possibly one of the visitors from further afield - was infected with the coronavirus and that many people contracted it there.""If you start looking at the number of cases that have come from that funeral, it's easy to see how quickly it spread,"" says Mohammed's son, Haroon, a radiologist.. ""At the funeral you shake each other's hand and talk to people, you're very close. ""The country went into lockdown shortly after, and the reports are coming out now that coronavirus was in the population for a significant period of time before we realised. So if you've got a gathering of people, it increases the chances that maybe one of them has it.""Haroon can list eight family members who were hospitalised and three who died.We have seen other patients who became ill after funerals and family gatherings in this same period, just before the lockdown. It's the close physical contact - hugging and shaking hands - that seems to create such a high rate of transmission. For the same reason, weddings and parties are also super-spreading events.By the time Mohammed returned home from Pakistan on 18 March, Haroon and his brother, who live with their parents, had symptoms too. ""We tried to distance ourselves,"" says Haroon. ""But when you're living in one household that's nigh-on impossible - there's only a certain number of bathrooms, there's only one fridge, one kitchen.""Mohammed was concerned about catching the virus because he is asthmatic, but that Saturday he developed symptoms. He stayed home for nine days, getting progressively worse, until his sons called 999. ""We walked him into the ambulance,"" says Haroon. ""That was a very emotional moment as we couldn't go with him and we didn't know when we would see him again.""When Mohammed arrived at Bradford Royal Infirmary, he saw his uncle in the waiting room, also wearing an oxygen mask. Sadly, he has since died.Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio.Mohammed was intubated and put on a ventilator. ""During that time, people are deeply sedated and their muscles are paralysed with medicines to allow the oxygen to get into the body,"" says Debbie Horner. Twice a day, Mohammed was proned, turned from front to back, to try and get as much oxygen into his body as possible by stimulating different bits of the lungs. This was done by a team of radiologists who volunteer to do this - they call themselves the Ratters - the Radiology Turning Team. At the start of this crisis, Covid-19 was thought to be primarily a lung disease where the life-saving treatment would be intubated ventilation, with patients sedated in intensive care. As the weeks have passed, clinicians have increasingly turned to less invasive ventilators called CPAP machines, which blow oxygen into the lungs, keeping them inflated - at Bradford we were using them from an early stage of the epidemic and putting patients on them at an earlier stage of their illness than some other hospitals.Predictions in March were that 30% of patients would be on ventilators in intensive care units. As it's turned out, it's less than 20% nationally and less than 10% in Bradford, suggesting that this early and less invasive treatment is effective.""I genuinely believe we've managed to pitch it right here,"" says Dr Tom Lawton, a consultant in critical care. ""By using simple machines that are designed to make it all as easy as possible, and having brilliant staff that are prepared to jump in and do everything - even care that they're not used to delivering in that kind of environment - we haven't brought as many people to intensive care as we thought we would. And yet, our patients don't seem to have suffered as a result."" Preliminary data shows the death rate of Bradford Royal Infirmary is 23%, that's lower than national figures. However in ICU the death rate is 50%, in line with other ICU rates.Once out of intensive care, Mohammed Hussain began a slow process of rehabilitation on a stroke ward.His shoulder was damaged during proning and he needed additional physio - he couldn't move his right arm much and so it was difficult for him to feed himself.He is full of gratitude. ""Believe me, the people who work in ICU, in this crisis, putting themselves at risk, they are the most amazing people,"" he says. ""It's not just the medical treatment, but it's the human touch. It's the depth of the conversations, the genuine interest and how you develop relationships. It contributes massively towards you getting better. ""I remember when I was first taken upstairs on the ward, this poor doctor was running various tests and he went to get me a drink - he brought me pineapple juice. It was like a drink from heaven. ""Sometimes the enormity of what we've been through affects me and makes me emotional.""During the five weeks that his dad was unconscious, Haroon kept everyone updated via Whatsapp. ""There were so many people worried about him,"" he says. ""My dad is incredibly well-known in the community and the messages were going to hundreds of people throughout the world. Everywhere you go, you meet people who my dad has helped."" Looking through the replies from his hospital bed, Mohammed spotted a theme: ""Oh, he's too stubborn, he's too tough, he'll be all right…""""I didn't know that's how I was viewed by people,"" he says. But Haroon isn't having it. ""You did know that, that's a lie!"" Mohammed finally left hospital on Tuesday, to a standing ovation from ward staff. I think one of one of the things that we didn't really do right at the start was celebrate those successes of patients leaving the ward - you tend to focus on the more tragic cases. So we have got better at that, and every patient that is discharged now, is a source of great joy. A couple of days ago Haroon updated us on what happened next. ""When I went to collect him from the hospital I didn't tell the rest of the family. I called them all down saying I needed to speak to them, and there was Dad sitting in his armchair. It was an amazing moment, just phenomenal, to have him home.""He's just been out in the garden for the first time today and he was elated. He gets very tired very quickly so it's a slow process, but he's surrounded by love.""And Haroon's mum has now returned from Pakistan, so the family is together again. They're overjoyed.Follow @docjohnwright and radio producer @SueM1tchell on TwitterGovernment advisers have been considering since March whether to include loss of smell among the criteria for deciding whether someone has Covid-19.

Coronavirus: Imaging equipment ‘woefully underfunded’,"Radiologists say they are ""very concerned"" patients may not be cured of serious illnesses when demand for services increases, due to a lack of imaging equipment in the UK. The president of the Royal College of Radiologists has warned the service had been ""woefully underfunded"". She said cleaning requirements because of coronavirus would reduce capacity.The Department of Health and Social Care in England said it was investing £200m on imaging equipment.""Radiology is one of those services that people use all the time, but don't really often think about, it's not sexy like surgery"", said Dr Jeanette Dickson, president of the Royal College of Radiologists.""Imaging touches on virtually every patient who comes into a hospital.""If you look at us on a European-wide average, we are certainly one of the countries that have the fewest number of scanners a head of the population.""A comparison by the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in 2014 - the last set of comparable figures - showed there were just 9.5 scanners per million head of the population, far below figures for Spain, Germany, France and Italy. The BBC has been told some trusts just had a single CT scanner in operation in the UK.Dr Dickson said normal service before the outbreak was ""woefully underfunded and under-resourced"" and that they were ""coping but barely"".She said the whole of imaging was very much understaffed prior to the Covid-19 crisis. The latest figures form the Royal College of Radiologists show 11% of funded posts for radiologists across the UK were vacant.In April, Cancer Research said a drop-off in screening and referrals meant roughly 2,700 fewer people were being diagnosed every week.Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK's director of early diagnosis said CT scanners for diagnosing cancer ""were already at breaking point before the pandemic"".The BBC understands that more than 30 CT scanners have been obtained from the independent sector during the coronavirus crisis, with at least 35 more ordered.""Capacity will be much, much less than demand"" even with the equipment that has been ordered, Dr Dickson said.She warned even when all imaging resumes, and the NHS gets back to operating fully, it would take ""at least  30-45 minutes"" to deep clean scanners after Covid-19 patients and ""more attention"" was being paid to cleaning equipment between all patients. Patients have to socially distance in the waiting room.""I am very concerned that we may find that patients are suffering unnecessary treatments or unnecessarily damaging treatments and losing the opportunity for a cure of cancer or another serious illness, because of the lack of imaging,"" Dr Dickson said.Sara Hiom added: ""The government needs to invest in the necessary equipment, employing and training more staff to enable the NHS to cope with the backlog of patients waiting for cancer care. ""Prompt diagnosis and treatment remain crucial to give patients the greatest chances of survival.""The Department of Health and Social Care in England said in a statement it is ""committed to increasing our capacity for earlier cancer diagnosis and have provided £200m for new state of the art diagnostic machines to improve the quality and speed of diagnosis and replace any outdated machines"".It added that cancer services would be ""among the first of many NHS services to be returning to normal"" during the coronavirus outbreak.A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""Increased cleaning of CT scanners and additional infection control measures are in place throughout the pandemic to protect staff and patients. ""The NHS is making full use of the additional scanning capacity in the independent sector as well as buying additional scanners so that tests can go ahead as normal.""  The Welsh government said it was ""increasing diagnostic capacity in radiology, including a new National Imaging Academy, and doubling the radiology training programme"".Meanwhile, the Scottish government said it expected all health boards to ""continue to prioritise radiology capacity for those patients referred with an urgent suspicion of cancer throughout and beyond the Covid-19 outbreak"".""The majority of cancer radiology diagnostics and treatments have continued, however some patient's treatment plans will change to minimise their individual risk,"" it added.",17 May 2020,health
