"Coronavirus came to UK 'on at least 1,300 separate occasions'","Coronavirus was brought into the UK on at least 1,300 separate occasions, a major analysis of the genetics of the virus shows.The study, by the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium (Cog-UK), completely quashes the idea that a single ""patient zero"" started the whole UK outbreak.The analysis also finds China, where the pandemic started, had a negligible impact on cases in the UK.Instead those initial cases came mostly from European countries. The researchers analysed the genetic code of viral samples taken from more than 20,000 people infected with coronavirus in the UK.Then, like a gigantic version of a paternity test, the geneticists attempted to piece together the virus's massive family tree. This was combined with data on international travel to get to the origins of the UK epidemic. They found the UK's coronavirus epidemic did not have one origin - but at least 1,356 origins. On each of those occasions somebody brought the infection into the UK from abroad and the virus began to spread as a result. ""The surprising and exciting conclusion is that we found the UK epidemic has resulted from a very large number of separate importations,"" said Prof Nick Loman, from Cog-UK and the University of Birmingham.""It wasn't a patient zero,"" he added.The study showed that less than 0.1% of those imported cases came directly from China. Instead the UK's coronavirus epidemic was largely initiated by travel from Italy in late February, Spain in early-to-mid-March and then France in mid-to-late-March.""The big surprise for us was how fluid the process was, the rate of and source of virus introduction shifted rapidly over the course of only a few weeks,"" said Prof Oliver Pybus, from the University of Oxford.80% occurred from 28 Feb-29 Mar ""This happened later than perhaps we would have expected,"" added Prof Loman.The study estimates 80% of those initial cases arrived in the country between 28 Feb and 29 March - the time the UK was debating whether to lockdown.After this point, the number of new imported cases diminished rapidly.The earliest one could be traced back to the beginning of February, but it is possible there were cases even earlier that could not be picked up by the analysis.The study also says the controversial football match between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid, on 11 March, probably had very little impact on bringing the virus into the country.An estimated 3,000 fans flew in from Spain to watch the game, but there were 20,000 people flying in from Spain every single day in mid-March.""[It] shows that individual events such as football matches likely made a negligible contribution to the number of imports at that time,"" the study says.The imported cases each started off a chain of transmission where the virus is passed from one person, to the next, to the next and so on.However, the study shows lockdown has massively disrupted the spread of the virus.""If there's good news here, these chains of transmission were and are being suppressed and going extinct as a result of social distancing and we continue to see that now,"" Prof Loman said.Follow James on Twitter",10 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: Asymptomatic transmission still an 'open question',"How much coronavirus transmission comes from people with no symptoms is still a ""big unknown"", a World Health Organization scientist has clarified.Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said on Monday it was ""very rare"" for asymptomatic people to pass the disease on.But she has now stressed this observation was based on a relatively small set of studies.Evidence suggests people with symptoms are most infectious, but the disease can be passed on before they develop. Although a proportion of people test positive with no symptoms, it is not known how many of these people go on to infect others.Dr Van Kerkhove said the evidence she had been discussing came from countries that had carried out ""detailed contact tracing"", Looking at investigations of clusters of infections from various countries, she said that where an asymptomatic case had been followed up it was ""very rare"" to find secondary infections among their contacts.But she it was still a ""big open question"" as to whether the same was true globally.The uncertainties involved emphasise the importance of lockdown measures in ""massively reduc[ing] the numbers of people infected,"" said Prof Liam Smeeth, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He said he had been ""surprised"" by the WHO statement but had not seen the data it was based on.Director of the WHO's health emergencies programme, Dr Michael Ryan, said he was ""absolutely convinced"" asymptomatic transmission was occurring, ""the question is how much"".  Dr Van Kerkhove, the WHO's head of emerging diseases, made the distinction between three categories:Some reports distinguish between these categories while others do not and she said this, along with the relatively small groups of people studied, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions. But Dr Van Kerkhove said the weight of evidence suggested people who never develop symptoms did not play a significant role in passing on the virus in the locations studied.Studies which tested samples of the population to find asymptomatic cases, and then traced their contacts, found far fewer secondary infections than in the contacts of people who'd had symptoms. This led the WHO, in guidance on wearing masks published at the weekend, to conclude: ""The available evidence from contact tracing reported by member states suggests that asymptomatically-infected individuals are much less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms""In England, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been regularly testing a sample of the population.It has found that, of those who have so far tested positive for Covid-19, only 29% reported ""any evidence of symptoms"" at the time they were tested, or at the previous or following visits.Contact-tracing studies from a number of countries suggest that while ""true"" asymptomatic cases ""rarely transmit"" infection, transmission can occur before or on the day symptoms first appear when they may be very mild, according to Prof Babak Javid, an infectious diseases consultant at the University of Cambridge.People can have detectable amounts of the virus in their system roughly three days before developing symptoms and appear to be capable to passing it on during this period, especially the day before or on the day symptoms begin. Pre-symptomatic transmission has ""important implications"" for track, trace and isolation measures, Prof Javid said. Under the terms of the contact-tracing schemes now operational across the UK, someone who passed on the infection while pre-symptomatic could still have their contacts traced once they developed symptoms. Someone who never experienced symptoms wouldn't trigger the same process. While people without symptoms do seem to be capable of infecting others, current evidence still suggests people with symptoms are the highest risk. A positive result alone doesn't tell you how much of the virus someone has in their system. And this - what is known as the viral load - along with whether an infected person is sneezing and coughing and what kind of contact they are having with other people, influences how likely they are to pass the illness on.Dr Van Kerkhove pointed out since coronavirus mainly ""passes through infectious droplets"", it is when people are coughing or sneezing that they are most able to transmit the disease.

Coronavirus: Lockdowns in Europe saved millions of lives,"Lockdowns have saved more than three million lives from coronavirus in Europe, a study estimates.The team at Imperial College London said the ""death toll would have been huge"" without lockdown. But they warned that only a small proportion of people had been infected and we were still only ""at the beginning of the pandemic"".Another study argued global lockdowns had ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".The Imperial study assessed the impact of restrictions in 11 European countries - Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK - up to the beginning of May.By that time, around 130,000 people had died from coronavirus in those countries.The researchers used disease modelling to predict how many deaths there would have been if lockdown had not happened. And the work comes from the same group that guided the UK's decision to go into lockdown.They estimated 3.2 million people would have died by 4 May if not for measures such as closing businesses and telling people to stay at home.That meant lockdown saved around 3.1 million lives, including 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France and 630,000 in Italy, the report in the journal Nature shows. ""Lockdown averted millions of deaths, those deaths would have been a tragedy,"" said Dr Seth Flaxman, from Imperial.Their equations made several assumptions, which will affect the figures. They assume nobody would have changed their behaviour in response to the Covid threat without a lockdown - and that hospitals would not be overwhelmed resulting in a surge in deaths, which nearly happened in some countries. The study also does not take into account the health consequences of lockdowns that may take years to fully uncover. The model also predicted that the outbreak would be nearly over by now without lockdown, as so many people would have been infected.More than seven in 10 people in the UK would have had Covid, leading to herd immunity and the virus no longer spreading. Instead, the researchers estimate that up to 15 million people across Europe had been infected by the beginning of May.The researchers say at most, 4% of the population in those countries had been infected. ""Claims this is all over can be firmly rejected. We are only at the beginning of this pandemic,"" said Dr Flaxman.And it means that as lockdowns start to lift, there is the risk the virus could start to spread again.""There is a very real risk if mobility goes back up there could be a second wave coming reasonably soon, in the next month or two,"" said Dr Samir Bhatt.Meanwhile, a separate study by University of California, Berkeley, analysed the impact of lockdowns in China, South Korea, Iran, France and the US.Their report, also in Nature, says lockdown prevented 530 million infections in those countries. Just before lockdowns were introduced, they said cases were doubling every two days. Dr Solomon Hsiang, one of the researchers, said coronavirus had been a ""real human tragedy"" but the global action to stop the spread of the virus had ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".Follow James on Twitter",8 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: Risk higher for pregnant BAME women,"The high proportion of pregnant women from black and ethnic minority (BAME) groups admitted to hospital with Covid-19 ""needs urgent investigation"", says a study in the British Medical Journal.Out of 427 pregnant women studied between March and April, more than half were from these backgrounds - nearly three times the expected number.Most were admitted late in pregnancy and did not become seriously ill.Although babies can be infected, the researchers said this was ""uncommon"".The findings, based on data for pregnant women with coronavirus admitted to 194 obstetric units across the UK over six weeks, show:In normal times, 20% of women giving birth are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds (BAME), lead author Prof Marian Knight, professor of maternal and child population health from the University of Oxford, says.When other factors such as obesity and age were taken into account, there was still a much higher proportion from ethnic minority groups than expected, the authors said.And this was still the case when pregnant women in hospitals in big cities were excluded from the analysis.This suggests the effect is not just down to higher infection rates in urban areas, Prof Knight said.But the explanation for why BAME pregnant women are disproportionately affected by coronavirus is not simple ""or easily solved"", she added.""We have to talk to women themselves, as well as health professionals, to give us more of a clue.""Prof Knight also said it was wrong to talk about BAME women as if they were all one group and all the same. Disparities could be linked to factors such as employment, multi-generational households, transport use and culture.""Covid is the lens showing us how important disparities are,"" Prof Knight said.She said women from certain communities might be less reluctant to seek help and advice early if they felt unwell.Karen Mannering tested positive for Covid-19 in March, six months into her pregnancy. ""I was so weak that I would pass out from tiredness and I would hurt from top to bottom,"" she explains. ""I had difficulties breathing.

Coronavirus: WHO advises to wear masks in public areas,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus.The global body said new information showed they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"".Some countries already recommend or mandate face coverings in public.The WHO had previously argued there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks.However, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that ""in light of evolving evidence, the WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments"".The organisation had always advised that medical face masks should be worn by people who are sick and by those caring for them.Globally, there have been 6.7 million confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 400,000 deaths since the outbreak began late last year, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The organisation said its new guidance had been prompted by studies over recent weeks. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead expert on Covid-19, told Reuters news agency the recommendation was for people to wear a ""fabric mask - that is, a non-medical mask"".Fabric masks should consist of ""at least three layers of different material"" in order to be effective, the WHO says.However, those aged over-60 and with underlying health risks should wear medical masks in areas where there is community transmission.At the same time, the WHO stressed that face masks were just one of a range of tools that could be used to reduce the risk of transmission - and that they should not give people a false sense of protection.""Masks on their own will not protect you from Covid-19,"" Dr Tedros said.This is a big shift in the WHO's guidance on when the public should cover their faces. For months, the organisation's experts stuck to the line that masks would encourage a false sense of security and would deprive medical professionals of badly needed protective equipment.Those arguments have not gone away but at the same time the WHO acknowledges that new evidence has emerged on the risks of transmission.It points to recent research that people can be highly infectious in the few days before they show symptoms and that some people catch the virus but never show symptoms at all, as I reported last weekend.So where distancing is not possible, such as on public transport and in locations as varied as shops and refugee camps, it is suggested that faces are covered with homemade masks to avoid passing on the infection.Over 60s with underlying health conditions should go further, the WHO said, and wear medical-grade masks to give themselves better protection.In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro threatened to pull the country out of the WHO unless it ceased to be a ""partisan political organisation"". The leader, who had initially dismissed the virus as a ""little flu"", has been critical of the lockdown policies recommended by the agency to tackle the spread of the disease.Last week, US President Donald Trump said he would end ties with the WHO, saying it had failed to hold China - where the outbreak begun - to account over coronavirus.In the UK, the government announced on Friday that hospital visitors and outpatients would be required to wear face coverings, and that hospital staff would have to wear medical masks, even if they were not in a clinical setting.The guidance will come into force on 15 June, as more businesses open up and more pupils return to school. Also on Friday the UK became the second country to record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths, after the US.The court of appeal in New South Wales, Australia, overturned a ban on a Black Lives Matter protest, which was imposed due to coronavirus concerns.

"Coronavirus came to UK 'on at least 1,300 separate occasions'","Coronavirus was brought into the UK on at least 1,300 separate occasions, a major analysis of the genetics of the virus shows.The study, by the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium (Cog-UK), completely quashes the idea that a single ""patient zero"" started the whole UK outbreak.The analysis also finds China, where the pandemic started, had a negligible impact on cases in the UK.Instead those initial cases came mostly from European countries. The researchers analysed the genetic code of viral samples taken from more than 20,000 people infected with coronavirus in the UK.Then, like a gigantic version of a paternity test, the geneticists attempted to piece together the virus's massive family tree. This was combined with data on international travel to get to the origins of the UK epidemic. They found the UK's coronavirus epidemic did not have one origin - but at least 1,356 origins. On each of those occasions somebody brought the infection into the UK from abroad and the virus began to spread as a result. ""The surprising and exciting conclusion is that we found the UK epidemic has resulted from a very large number of separate importations,"" said Prof Nick Loman, from Cog-UK and the University of Birmingham.""It wasn't a patient zero,"" he added.The study showed that less than 0.1% of those imported cases came directly from China. Instead the UK's coronavirus epidemic was largely initiated by travel from Italy in late February, Spain in early-to-mid-March and then France in mid-to-late-March.""The big surprise for us was how fluid the process was, the rate of and source of virus introduction shifted rapidly over the course of only a few weeks,"" said Prof Oliver Pybus, from the University of Oxford.80% occurred from 28 Feb-29 Mar ""This happened later than perhaps we would have expected,"" added Prof Loman.The study estimates 80% of those initial cases arrived in the country between 28 Feb and 29 March - the time the UK was debating whether to lockdown.After this point, the number of new imported cases diminished rapidly.The earliest one could be traced back to the beginning of February, but it is possible there were cases even earlier that could not be picked up by the analysis.The study also says the controversial football match between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid, on 11 March, probably had very little impact on bringing the virus into the country.An estimated 3,000 fans flew in from Spain to watch the game, but there were 20,000 people flying in from Spain every single day in mid-March.""[It] shows that individual events such as football matches likely made a negligible contribution to the number of imports at that time,"" the study says.The imported cases each started off a chain of transmission where the virus is passed from one person, to the next, to the next and so on.However, the study shows lockdown has massively disrupted the spread of the virus.""If there's good news here, these chains of transmission were and are being suppressed and going extinct as a result of social distancing and we continue to see that now,"" Prof Loman said.Follow James on Twitter",10 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: Asymptomatic transmission still an 'open question',"How much coronavirus transmission comes from people with no symptoms is still a ""big unknown"", a World Health Organization scientist has clarified.Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said on Monday it was ""very rare"" for asymptomatic people to pass the disease on.But she has now stressed this observation was based on a relatively small set of studies.Evidence suggests people with symptoms are most infectious, but the disease can be passed on before they develop. Although a proportion of people test positive with no symptoms, it is not known how many of these people go on to infect others.Dr Van Kerkhove said the evidence she had been discussing came from countries that had carried out ""detailed contact tracing"", Looking at investigations of clusters of infections from various countries, she said that where an asymptomatic case had been followed up it was ""very rare"" to find secondary infections among their contacts.But she it was still a ""big open question"" as to whether the same was true globally.The uncertainties involved emphasise the importance of lockdown measures in ""massively reduc[ing] the numbers of people infected,"" said Prof Liam Smeeth, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He said he had been ""surprised"" by the WHO statement but had not seen the data it was based on.Director of the WHO's health emergencies programme, Dr Michael Ryan, said he was ""absolutely convinced"" asymptomatic transmission was occurring, ""the question is how much"".  Dr Van Kerkhove, the WHO's head of emerging diseases, made the distinction between three categories:Some reports distinguish between these categories while others do not and she said this, along with the relatively small groups of people studied, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions. But Dr Van Kerkhove said the weight of evidence suggested people who never develop symptoms did not play a significant role in passing on the virus in the locations studied.Studies which tested samples of the population to find asymptomatic cases, and then traced their contacts, found far fewer secondary infections than in the contacts of people who'd had symptoms. This led the WHO, in guidance on wearing masks published at the weekend, to conclude: ""The available evidence from contact tracing reported by member states suggests that asymptomatically-infected individuals are much less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms""In England, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been regularly testing a sample of the population.It has found that, of those who have so far tested positive for Covid-19, only 29% reported ""any evidence of symptoms"" at the time they were tested, or at the previous or following visits.Contact-tracing studies from a number of countries suggest that while ""true"" asymptomatic cases ""rarely transmit"" infection, transmission can occur before or on the day symptoms first appear when they may be very mild, according to Prof Babak Javid, an infectious diseases consultant at the University of Cambridge.People can have detectable amounts of the virus in their system roughly three days before developing symptoms and appear to be capable to passing it on during this period, especially the day before or on the day symptoms begin. Pre-symptomatic transmission has ""important implications"" for track, trace and isolation measures, Prof Javid said. Under the terms of the contact-tracing schemes now operational across the UK, someone who passed on the infection while pre-symptomatic could still have their contacts traced once they developed symptoms. Someone who never experienced symptoms wouldn't trigger the same process. While people without symptoms do seem to be capable of infecting others, current evidence still suggests people with symptoms are the highest risk. A positive result alone doesn't tell you how much of the virus someone has in their system. And this - what is known as the viral load - along with whether an infected person is sneezing and coughing and what kind of contact they are having with other people, influences how likely they are to pass the illness on.Dr Van Kerkhove pointed out since coronavirus mainly ""passes through infectious droplets"", it is when people are coughing or sneezing that they are most able to transmit the disease.

Coronavirus: Lockdowns in Europe saved millions of lives,"Lockdowns have saved more than three million lives from coronavirus in Europe, a study estimates.The team at Imperial College London said the ""death toll would have been huge"" without lockdown. But they warned that only a small proportion of people had been infected and we were still only ""at the beginning of the pandemic"".Another study argued global lockdowns had ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".The Imperial study assessed the impact of restrictions in 11 European countries - Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK - up to the beginning of May.By that time, around 130,000 people had died from coronavirus in those countries.The researchers used disease modelling to predict how many deaths there would have been if lockdown had not happened. And the work comes from the same group that guided the UK's decision to go into lockdown.They estimated 3.2 million people would have died by 4 May if not for measures such as closing businesses and telling people to stay at home.That meant lockdown saved around 3.1 million lives, including 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France and 630,000 in Italy, the report in the journal Nature shows. ""Lockdown averted millions of deaths, those deaths would have been a tragedy,"" said Dr Seth Flaxman, from Imperial.Their equations made several assumptions, which will affect the figures. They assume nobody would have changed their behaviour in response to the Covid threat without a lockdown - and that hospitals would not be overwhelmed resulting in a surge in deaths, which nearly happened in some countries. The study also does not take into account the health consequences of lockdowns that may take years to fully uncover. The model also predicted that the outbreak would be nearly over by now without lockdown, as so many people would have been infected.More than seven in 10 people in the UK would have had Covid, leading to herd immunity and the virus no longer spreading. Instead, the researchers estimate that up to 15 million people across Europe had been infected by the beginning of May.The researchers say at most, 4% of the population in those countries had been infected. ""Claims this is all over can be firmly rejected. We are only at the beginning of this pandemic,"" said Dr Flaxman.And it means that as lockdowns start to lift, there is the risk the virus could start to spread again.""There is a very real risk if mobility goes back up there could be a second wave coming reasonably soon, in the next month or two,"" said Dr Samir Bhatt.Meanwhile, a separate study by University of California, Berkeley, analysed the impact of lockdowns in China, South Korea, Iran, France and the US.Their report, also in Nature, says lockdown prevented 530 million infections in those countries. Just before lockdowns were introduced, they said cases were doubling every two days. Dr Solomon Hsiang, one of the researchers, said coronavirus had been a ""real human tragedy"" but the global action to stop the spread of the virus had ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".Follow James on Twitter",8 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: Risk higher for pregnant BAME women,"The high proportion of pregnant women from black and ethnic minority (BAME) groups admitted to hospital with Covid-19 ""needs urgent investigation"", says a study in the British Medical Journal.Out of 427 pregnant women studied between March and April, more than half were from these backgrounds - nearly three times the expected number.Most were admitted late in pregnancy and did not become seriously ill.Although babies can be infected, the researchers said this was ""uncommon"".The findings, based on data for pregnant women with coronavirus admitted to 194 obstetric units across the UK over six weeks, show:In normal times, 20% of women giving birth are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds (BAME), lead author Prof Marian Knight, professor of maternal and child population health from the University of Oxford, says.When other factors such as obesity and age were taken into account, there was still a much higher proportion from ethnic minority groups than expected, the authors said.And this was still the case when pregnant women in hospitals in big cities were excluded from the analysis.This suggests the effect is not just down to higher infection rates in urban areas, Prof Knight said.But the explanation for why BAME pregnant women are disproportionately affected by coronavirus is not simple ""or easily solved"", she added.""We have to talk to women themselves, as well as health professionals, to give us more of a clue.""Prof Knight also said it was wrong to talk about BAME women as if they were all one group and all the same. Disparities could be linked to factors such as employment, multi-generational households, transport use and culture.""Covid is the lens showing us how important disparities are,"" Prof Knight said.She said women from certain communities might be less reluctant to seek help and advice early if they felt unwell.Karen Mannering tested positive for Covid-19 in March, six months into her pregnancy. ""I was so weak that I would pass out from tiredness and I would hurt from top to bottom,"" she explains. ""I had difficulties breathing. My taste and smell vanished and still hasn't come back.""The 39-year-old from Kent developed pneumonia in both of her lungs and was hospitalised for a week. She is now preparing to be induced several weeks early.""The fear of having coronavirus during my pregnancy is horrible"" she says. ""I have been so scared for my unborn baby. I'm constantly wondering if he is ok. Even in my dreams, I worry. It's always in the back of my mind. ""I recently visited the nurses who looked after me and they told me I am the only pregnant woman with coronavirus that they've treated so far. It shows how unlucky I was to catch it.""Most pregnant women admitted to hospital had a fever, cough or breathlessness and were discharged to recover at home.One in 10 of the pregnant women studied needed respiratory support in a critical care unit in hospital, while three women died as a direct result of complications from Covid-19.The data, from the UK Obstetric Surveillance System, showed that 12 (5%) babies born to mothers in the study tested positive for Covid-19, half of them within the first 12 hours after birth, but none was seriously unwell.Midwives said ""clear and urgent direction"" was needed from the government to tackle the issue.""Even before the pandemic, women from black, Asian or ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to die in and around their pregnancy,"" Gill Walton from the Royal College of Midwives says.She said they were ""still at unacceptable risk"" and getting help and support to affected communities was crucial.The RCM has four important messages for women:Ms Walton added: ""The system is failing them and that has got to change quickly, because they matter, their lives matter and they deserve the best and safest care.""How have you been affected by any of the issues raised in this article?

Coronavirus: WHO advises to wear masks in public areas,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus.The global body said new information showed they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"".Some countries already recommend or mandate face coverings in public.The WHO had previously argued there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks.However, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that ""in light of evolving evidence, the WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments"".The organisation had always advised that medical face masks should be worn by people who are sick and by those caring for them.Globally, there have been 6.7 million confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 400,000 deaths since the outbreak began late last year, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The organisation said its new guidance had been prompted by studies over recent weeks. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead expert on Covid-19, told Reuters news agency the recommendation was for people to wear a ""fabric mask - that is, a non-medical mask"".Fabric masks should consist of ""at least three layers of different material"" in order to be effective, the WHO says.However, those aged over-60 and with underlying health risks should wear medical masks in areas where there is community transmission.At the same time, the WHO stressed that face masks were just one of a range of tools that could be used to reduce the risk of transmission - and that they should not give people a false sense of protection.""Masks on their own will not protect you from Covid-19,"" Dr Tedros said.This is a big shift in the WHO's guidance on when the public should cover their faces. For months, the organisation's experts stuck to the line that masks would encourage a false sense of security and would deprive medical professionals of badly needed protective equipment.Those arguments have not gone away but at the same time the WHO acknowledges that new evidence has emerged on the risks of transmission.It points to recent research that people can be highly infectious in the few days before they show symptoms and that some people catch the virus but never show symptoms at all, as I reported last weekend.So where distancing is not possible, such as on public transport and in locations as varied as shops and refugee camps, it is suggested that faces are covered with homemade masks to avoid passing on the infection.Over 60s with underlying health conditions should go further, the WHO said, and wear medical-grade masks to give themselves better protection.In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro threatened to pull the country out of the WHO unless it ceased to be a ""partisan political organisation"". The leader, who had initially dismissed the virus as a ""little flu"", has been critical of the lockdown policies recommended by the agency to tackle the spread of the disease.Last week, US President Donald Trump said he would end ties with the WHO, saying it had failed to hold China - where the outbreak begun - to account over coronavirus.In the UK, the government announced on Friday that hospital visitors and outpatients would be required to wear face coverings, and that hospital staff would have to wear medical masks, even if they were not in a clinical setting.The guidance will come into force on 15 June, as more businesses open up and more pupils return to school. Also on Friday the UK became the second country to record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths, after the US.The court of appeal in New South Wales, Australia, overturned a ban on a Black Lives Matter protest, which was imposed due to coronavirus concerns.

Coronavirus: What is the k number and can superspreading be stopped?,"As the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus, scientists have another target in their sights - the superspreading event, when one person infects many others. And there is a new number that's key to understanding why that happens. During the pandemic, there has been a focus on the reproduction or R number. This is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average.However, not every person with coronavirus passes it on to the same number of people. Some may self-isolate and infect nobody, while others go about their life and infect many people.This is where the k number is useful. It measures the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects. The smaller the k number is, the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is. This means more superspreaders, each individually infecting higher numbers of people.About 10-15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections, according to an expert.Dr Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), says: ""Typically, what happens is a lot of people don't give the infection to anyone. ""And then there's a handful of events where you see large amounts of transmission happening with five, 10, 20 people potentially infected. And we saw that even quite early on with Covid.""Covid-19 is passed on through people shedding virus particles from their bodies.How infectious someone is depends on many factors that differ dramatically from person to person, including:But it is what they do when they are at their most infectious that really drives superspreading events.""If someone, when they're most transmissible, happens to go to an all-day meeting with a large number of people, and then go out for dinner afterwards, you may well see a superspreading event,"" Dr Kucharski says.""If that person happened to have an evening at home, it might not have generated any transmission.""Scientists have been keeping track of clusters of Covid-19 since the pandemic began.Dr Gwen Knight, from LSHTM, says: ""We found that many of the settings are what we expected. ""So care settings - hospitals and care homes - unfortunately, are coming up. ""And also cruise ships, which is something we know from other infectious diseases.""But she also found clusters repeatedly appearing in other places - meat-processing plants, choirs, bars and gyms.All of these involve being indoors, in close contact with others, for prolonged periods of time.But Dr Knight says there is another common thread.""These settings are likely to be loud settings, and obviously, that has an impact on the kind of breathing you do,"" she says. ""There is the hypothesis that because it's loud, and you're expelling more or faster air, it could be this that makes the setting more and more risky.""There were several clusters linked to fitness classes in South Korea, and more were linked to Zumba classes than to pilates classes. ""So it might be that you're engaged in an exercise that requires you to breathe more heavily and deeper, as opposed to a more gentle breathing, for example.""Dr Muge Cevik, of the University of St Andrews, says: ""Not all activities, not all environments have the same risk of infection.""So, for example, the risk of infection would be higher indoors compared to outdoors.""Outdoors, generally people worry about cyclists or runners passing by - but that would be lower risk. We could say the transmission risk is negligible.""Whereas if you spend a whole day together, in a big group in a park, and if you exchange lots of food and you have really close contact, less than 2m (6ft), the risk is lower than being indoors - but there is still risk.""Hand-washing, social distancing and not sharing utensils is essential, she says.Strict lockdowns were a blunt tool for halting the spread of coronavirus.But as infections decrease, and the world opens up, scientists say a more targeted approach is needed,Dr Cevik says: ""We need to understand the transmission dynamics so we can concentrate our contact-tracing focus. ""But if we can avoid these superspreading events, and the environments and activities associated with them, you can decrease almost 80% of infections. ""And that's huge.""

"Coronavirus: England test and trace system identifies 31,000 contacts","More than 31,000 close contacts of people with coronavirus were identified during the first week of the test and trace system in England, figures show.Of those, 85% were reached and asked to self-isolate for 14 days.This was from 8,000 people testing positive for the virus. Two thirds of them gave details of close contacts.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was the public's ""civic duty"" to follow instructions given by contact tracers.Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, he added he was not ruling out enforcement measures to make people self-isolate for 14 days if asked to do so.About 25,000 contact tracers were recruited in England and started work at the end of May.The NHS figures, which cover 28 May to 3 June, are the first to be released showing the progress of the contact tracing scheme.Baroness Dido Harding, who runs NHS Test and Trace in England, said the system was working well but it ""can, needs to and will get better"".The system has been unable to reach 15% of close contacts identified - 4,809 people - either because they were unavailable, their contact details were wrong or they did not respond to texts, emails or calls from contact tracers.Appearing alongside Mr Hancock at the briefing, Baroness Harding said that did not necessarily mean those people had not self-isolated, adding: ""Only a small minority don't want to self isolate and we need to understand why this is and what we can do to support them to stay at home.""She said earlier there had been ""good numbers of compliance"" with 26,985 contacts of positive cases identified, reached and asked to self-isolate.One contact tracer, Josie, has been working from her home in Redcar, North Yorkshire, to trace contacts.""Everybody that I've spoke to has been more than happy to share the information that we need,"" she told the BBC.Baroness Harding added the ""number one thing"" that would improve the programme was more people getting tested for the virus once they develop symptoms.Appealing to people to comply with the measures, Mr Hancock said: ""Please do it to protect your loved ones, do it to protect your community, do it to protect the nation and do it to protect the NHS.""In response to a question about potential enforcement to make more people co-operate with the scheme, Mr Hancock said: ""We're not ruling it out, but we don't think we need it at the moment.""He said the ""best way forward"" was to see an increase in the number of people being contacted.Contact tracers are told to try to contact people 10 times in a 24-hour period.Most of the people called in the first week were identified by local public health teams as part of investigations into outbreaks.As lockdown eases, and people start to return to work and go out to shops, it is expected the number of contacts people have will start to grow from a low starting point.In the first week of the test and trace scheme, contact was made with 5,407 people who tested positive for coronavirus, asking them to provide details of recent contacts. Their cases may also have been investigated as part of a local outbreak.Some 2,710 with positive tests were not reached, either because their contact details were not correct or they decided not to give out information about their contacts.The data from the test and trace system in England has been eagerly anticipated - after all, this system will be crucial in helping contain local outbreaks, enabling the country to ease out of lockdown.It is still early days, but how should we interpret these findings? Firstly, the system seems to be pretty good at reaching the contacts of people who have tested positive, if those positive cases engage with the contact tracers and provide details in the first place.The problem is a third of people who test positive are not providing details.This could be because the contact tracers are not as good as they should be at tracking those who do not engage with the online forms (the first point of call for the system).There have been suggestions that sufficient translation support is not always available, for example.But incorrect contact details being provided and people simply refusing to take calls - despite repeated attempts - are certainly factors too.The key to the success of the system will be both an efficient service and public engagement in taking calls and following the advice to self-isolate.It's a way of controlling the spread of the virus by asking people who have tested positive for coronavirus to share information on who they have been in close contact with.It starts with getting a test if you have symptoms.If you test positive for the virus, tracers will text, email or call you and ask you to log on to the NHS Test and Trace website to provide details of contacts.Close contacts will then be contacted and told to stay at home for 14 days, even if they don't have symptoms.This process is organised slightly differently around the UK.In Scotland, the system is called NHS Test and Protect. Between 28 May and 7 June 2020, 741 contacts were traced from 681 positive tests for the virus - an average of 1.5 contacts per case.Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to bring in contact tracing.Contact tracing started in Wales on 1 June and is called 'test, trace, protect'.An app designed to help trace contacts in England - and possibly other parts of the UK - has been delayed after trials were carried out on the Isle of Wight.Mr Hancock said the contact-tracing app would be brought in ""when it's right to do so"".Separately, the Office for National Statistics has suggested that many more people have had the virus but have not been tested.A recent ONS survey of households in England estimated there could have been 39,000 new cases per week, up to 30 May - in addition to cases in hospitals or care homes.In other developments:Have you been contacted by a tracer?
