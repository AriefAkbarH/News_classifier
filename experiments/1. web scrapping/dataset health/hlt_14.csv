Coronavirus: WHO halts trials of hydroxychloroquine over safety fears,"Testing of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for coronavirus has been halted because of safety fears, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.Trials in several countries are being ""temporarily"" suspended as a precaution, the agency said on Monday.It comes after a recent medical study suggested the drug could increase the risk of patients dying from Covid-19.President Donald Trump has said he has taken the drug to ward off the virus.The US president has repeatedly promoted the anti-malarial drug, against medical advice and despite warnings from public health officials that it could cause heart problems.Last week, a study in medical journal The Lancet said there were no benefits to treating coronavirus patients with hydroxychloroquine, and that taking it might even increase the number of deaths among those in hospital with the disease.Hydroxychloroquine is safe for malaria, and conditions like lupus or arthritis, but no clinical trials have recommended its use for treating Covid-19.The WHO, which is running clinical trials of various drugs to assess which might be beneficial in treating the disease, has previously raised concerns over reports of individuals self-medicating and causing themselves serious harm.On Monday, officials at the UN health agency said hydroxychloroquine would be removed from those trials pending a safety assessment. The Lancet study involved 96,000 coronavirus patients, nearly 15,000 of whom were given hydroxychloroquine - or a related form chloroquine - either alone or with an antibiotic.The study found that the patients were more likely to die in hospital and develop heart rhythm complications than other Covid patients in a comparison group.The death rates of the treated groups were: hydroxychloroquine 18%; chloroquine 16.4%; control group 9%. Those treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in combination with antibiotics had an even higher death rate.The researchers warned that hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside of clinical trials.",25 May 2020,health

Coronavirus: UK authorises anti-viral drug remdesivir,"A drug treatment called remdesivir that appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus is being made available on the NHS. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was probably the biggest step forward in the treatment of coronavirus since the crisis began. Remdesivir is an anti-viral medicine that has been used against Ebola. UK regulators say there is enough evidence to approve its use in selected Covid-19 hospital patients. For the time being and due to limited supplies, it will go to those most likely to benefit.The US and Japan have already made similar urgent arrangements to provide early access to the medicine before they have a marketing agreement.The drug is currently undergoing clinical trials around the world, including in the UK. Early data suggests it can cut recovery time by about four days, but there is no evidence yet that it will save more lives.It is not clear how much stock pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences has available to treat UK patients. Allocation of the intravenous drug will be based on the advice of doctors.Minister for Innovation Lord Bethell said: ""This shows fantastic progress. As we navigate this unprecedented period, we must be on the front foot of the latest medical advancements, while always ensuring patient safety remains a top priority.""The latest, expert scientific advice is at the heart of every decision we make, and we will continue to monitor remdesivir's success in clinical trials across the country to ensure the best results for UK patients.""Dr Stephen Griffin from the University of Leeds Medical School, said it was perhaps the most promising anti-viral for coronavirus so far. He said patients with the most severe disease would be likely to receive it first. ""Whilst this is clearly the most ethically sound approach, it also means that we ought not to expect the drug to immediately act as a magic bullet. ""We can instead hope for improved recovery rates and a reduction in patient mortality, which we hope will benefit as many patients as possible.""Other drugs being investigated for coronavirus include those for malaria and HIV.Testing of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has been halted in some trials because of safety fears. The World Health Organization says the temporary suspension is a precaution, after a recent medical study found the drug might increase the risk of death and heart rhythm complications.In the UK, the Recovery trial looking at using this drug in patients remains open, but another one, using it in frontline NHS staff to prevent rather than treat infections, has paused recruiting more volunteers.",26 May 2020,health
Coronavirus: Immune clue sparks treatment hope,"UK scientists are to begin testing a treatment that it is hoped could counter the effects of Covid-19 in the most seriously ill patients.It has been found those with the most severe form of the disease have extremely low numbers of an immune cell called a T-cell. T-cells clear infection from the body.The clinical trial will evaluate if a drug called interleukin 7, known to boost T-cell numbers, can aid patients' recovery.It involves scientists from the Francis Crick Institute, King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.They have looked at immune cells in the blood of 60 Covid-19 patients and found an apparent crash in the numbers of T-cells. Prof Adrian Hayday from the Crick Institute said it was a ""great surprise"" to see what was happening with the immune cells.""They're trying to protect us, but the virus seems to be doing something that's pulling the rug from under them, because their numbers have declined dramatically.In a microlitre (0.001ml) drop of blood, normal healthy adults have between 2,000 and 4,000 T-cells, also called T lymphocytes. The Covid patients the team tested had between 200-1,200. The researchers say these findings pave the way for them to develop a ""fingerprint test"" to check the levels of T-cells in the blood which could provide early indications of who might go on to develop more severe disease. It also provides the possibility for a specific treatment to reverse that immune cell decline.  Manu Shankar-Hari, a critical care consultant at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, said that around 70% of patients that he sees in intensive care with Covid-19 arrive with between 400-800 lymphocytes per microlitre. ""When they start to recover, their lymphocyte level also starts to go back up,"" he added. Interleukin 7 has already been tested in a small group of patients with sepsis and proved to safely increase the production of these specific cells. In this trial, it will be given to patients with a low lymphocyte count who have been in critical care for more than three days.Mr Shankar-Hari said: ""We are hoping that [when we increase the cell count] the viral infections gets cleared.""As a critical care physician, I look after patients who are extremely unwell and, other than supportive care, we do not have any direct active treatment against the disease. ""So a treatment like this coming along for it in the context of a clinical trial is extremely encouraging for critical care physicians across the UK.""This research has also provided insight into the specific ways in which this disease interacts with the immune system, that Prof Hayday says will be vital as scientists around the world look for clinically valuable information. ""The virus that has caused this completely Earth-changing emergency is unique - it's  different. It is something unprecedented."" ""The exact reason for this disruption - the  spanner in the works of the T-cell system - is not at all clear to us.""This virus is really doing something distinct and future research - which we will start immediately - needs to find out the mechanism by which this virus is having these effects.""",22 May 2020,health
Coronavirus: Children and older adults to take part in vaccine trial,"Children and older adults are to be included in the second phase of vaccine trials to protect against coronavirus.The first phase of the University of Oxford trial began in April, involving 1,000 healthy adults aged 55 and under.Now more than 10,200 people - including over 70s and five to 12-year-olds - will be enrolled in the study, to see the effects on their immune system.Trials of the same vaccine on monkeys appear to have given them some protection against the disease.The animals had less of the virus in their lungs and airways, but it is not certain this finding will translate to people.The scientists behind the vaccine have previously said they are aiming to have at least a million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by September this year.But the UK government has repeatedly said there are no guarantees - and a vaccine could still be some way off.And most experts still estimate it will take 12 to 18 months to develop and manufacture a vaccine.There are more than 100 experimental vaccines against Covid-19 currently being developed worldwide.Adults in this trial will receive one or two doses of either the new vaccine - ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 - or another licensed vaccine.Researchers will then compare the number of infections in both groups. This could take between two and to six months, depending on how many people are exposed to the virus.The age range of participants has been expanded to include those aged:Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology, at the Jenner Institute, said: ""We have had a lot of interest already from people over the age of 55 years who were not eligible to take part in the phase-one study.""And we will now be able to include older age groups to continue the vaccine assessment.

Coronavirus: Hydroxychloroquine trial begins in the UK,"A trial to see whether two anti-malarial drugs could prevent Covid-19 has begun in Brighton and Oxford.Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or a placebo will be given to more than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.All the participants are staff who are in contact with Covid-19 patients.US President Donald Trump was criticised this week after he said he had been taking hydroxychloroquine, despite warnings it might be unsafe.The first UK participants in the global trial are being enrolled on Thursday at the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals and the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.  They will be given either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo for three months. At sites in Asia, participants will be given chloroquine or a placebo.These are the first of a planned 25 UK sites, with results expected by the end of the year. The trial is open to anyone delivering direct care to coronavirus patients in the UK, as long as they have not been diagnosed with Covid-19. It will test whether the drugs can prevent healthcare workers exposed to the virus from contracting it. One of the study's leaders, Prof Nicholas White at the University of Oxford said: ""We really do not know if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are beneficial or harmful against Covid-19.""But, he said, a randomised controlled trial such as this one, where neither the participant nor the researchers know who has been given the drug or a placebo, was the best way to find out. ""A widely available, safe and effective vaccine may be a long way off,"" said Prof Martin Llewelyn from Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who is also leading the study.  ""If drugs as well-tolerated as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could reduce the chances of catching Covid-19, this would be incredibly valuable."" The drugs can reduce fever and inflammation and are used as both a prevention and a treatment for malaria. Hydroxychloroquine regulates the body's immune response and is also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Lupus - an inflammatory disease caused by an overactive immune system. Lupus charities in the UK and US have raised concerns that demand for the drug associated with coronavirus could threaten the supply for patients who already rely on it. The drug gained attention after US President Donald Trump suggested it may be beneficial, and this week said he was taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus.The US Food and Drug Administration warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases, or clinical trials.While the University of Oxford trial is taking place in a controlled clinical environment, the World Health Organization has warned that some individuals were self-medicating and risked causing themselves serious harm.It has not yet been shown to be safe and effective in the prevention or treatment of coronavirus and can cause dangerous heart arrhythmias.
