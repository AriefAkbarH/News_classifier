Coronavirus: Immune clue sparks treatment hope,"UK scientists are to begin testing a treatment that it is hoped could counter the effects of Covid-19 in the most seriously ill patients.It has been found those with the most severe form of the disease have extremely low numbers of an immune cell called a T-cell. T-cells clear infection from the body.The clinical trial will evaluate if a drug called interleukin 7, known to boost T-cell numbers, can aid patients' recovery.It involves scientists from the Francis Crick Institute, King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.They have looked at immune cells in the blood of 60 Covid-19 patients and found an apparent crash in the numbers of T-cells. Prof Adrian Hayday from the Crick Institute said it was a ""great surprise"" to see what was happening with the immune cells.""They're trying to protect us, but the virus seems to be doing something that's pulling the rug from under them, because their numbers have declined dramatically.In a microlitre (0.001ml) drop of blood, normal healthy adults have between 2,000 and 4,000 T-cells, also called T lymphocytes. The Covid patients the team tested had between 200-1,200. The researchers say these findings pave the way for them to develop a ""fingerprint test"" to check the levels of T-cells in the blood which could provide early indications of who might go on to develop more severe disease. But it also provides the possibility for a specific treatment to reverse that immune cell decline.  Manu Shankar-Hari, a critical care consultant at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, said that around 70% of patients that he sees in intensive care with Covid-19 arrive with between 400-800 lymphocytes per microlitre. ""When they start to recover, their lymphocyte level also starts to go back up,"" he added. Interleukin 7 has already been tested in a small group of patients with sepsis and proved to safely increase the production of these specific cells. In this trial, it will be given to patients with a low lymphocyte count who have been in critical care for more than three days.Mr Shankar-Hari said: ""We are hoping that [when we increase the cell count] the viral infections gets cleared.""As a critical care physician, I look after patients who are extremely unwell and, other than supportive care, we do not have any direct active treatment against the disease. ""So a treatment like this coming along for in the context of a clinical trial is extremely encouraging for critical care physicians across the UK.""This research has also provided insight into the specific ways in which this disease interacts with the immune system, which Prof Hayday says will be vital as scientists around the world look for clinically valuable information. ""The virus that has caused this completely Earth-changing emergency is unique - it's  different. It is something unprecedented."" ""The exact reason for this disruption - the  spanner in the works of the T-cell system - is not at all clear to us.""This virus is really doing something distinct and future research - which we will start immediately - needs to find out the mechanism by which this virus is having these effects.""",22 May 2020,health

Coronavirus: Children and older adults to take part in vaccine trial,"Children and older adults are to be included in the second phase of vaccine trials to protect against coronavirus.The first phase of the University of Oxford trial began in April, involving 1,000 healthy adults aged 55 and under.Now more than 10,200 people - including over 70s and five to 12-year-olds - will be enrolled in the study, to see the effects on their immune system.Trials of the same vaccine on monkeys appear to have given them some protection against the disease.The animals had less of the virus in their lungs and airways, but it is not certain this finding will translate to people.The scientists behind the vaccine have previously said they are aiming to have at least a million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by September this year.But the UK government has repeatedly said there are no guarantees - and a vaccine could still be some way off.And most experts still estimate it will take 12 to 18 months to develop and manufacture a vaccine.There are more than 100 experimental vaccines against Covid-19 currently being developed worldwide.Adults in this trial will receive one or two doses of either the new vaccine - ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 - or another licensed vaccine.Researchers will then compare the number of infections in both groups. This could take between two and to six months, depending on how many people are exposed to the virus.The age range of participants has been expanded to include those aged:Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology, at the Jenner Institute, said: ""We have had a lot of interest already from people over the age of 55 years who were not eligible to take part in the phase-one study.""And we will now be able to include older age groups to continue the vaccine assessment.

Coronavirus: Hydroxychloroquine trial begins in the UK,"A trial to see whether two anti-malarial drugs could prevent Covid-19 has begun in Brighton and Oxford.Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or a placebo will be given to more than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.All the participants are staff who are in contact with Covid-19 patients.US President Donald Trump was criticised this week after he said he had been taking hydroxychloroquine, despite warnings it might be unsafe.The first UK participants in the global trial are being enrolled on Thursday at the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals and the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.  They will be given either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo for three months. At sites in Asia, participants will be given chloroquine or a placebo.These are the first of a planned 25 UK sites, with results expected by the end of the year. The trial is open to anyone delivering direct care to coronavirus patients in the UK, as long as they have not been diagnosed with Covid-19. It will test whether the drugs can prevent healthcare workers exposed to the virus from contracting it. One of the study's leaders, Prof Nicholas White at the University of Oxford said: ""We really do not know if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are beneficial or harmful against Covid-19.""But, he said, a randomised controlled trial such as this one, where neither the participant nor the researchers know who has been given the drug or a placebo, was the best way to find out. ""A widely available, safe and effective vaccine may be a long way off,"" said Prof Martin Llewelyn from Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who is also leading the study.  ""If drugs as well-tolerated as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could reduce the chances of catching Covid-19, this would be incredibly valuable."" The drugs can reduce fever and inflammation and are used as both a prevention and a treatment for malaria. Hydroxychloroquine regulates the body's immune response and is also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Lupus - an inflammatory disease caused by an overactive immune system. Lupus charities in the UK and US have raised concerns that demand for the drug associated with coronavirus could threaten the supply for patients who already rely on it. The drug gained attention after US President Donald Trump suggested it may be beneficial, and this week said he was taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus.The US Food and Drug Administration warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases, or clinical trials.While the University of Oxford trial is taking place in a controlled clinical environment, the World Health Organization has warned that some individuals were self-medicating and risked causing themselves serious harm.It has not yet been shown to be safe and effective in the prevention or treatment of coronavirus and can cause dangerous heart arrhythmias.

Fergus Walsh: 'I was gobsmacked to test positive for coronavirus antibodies',"Antibody tests which show that you have had a Covid-19 infection will be rolled out to NHS and care staff from next week. So what happens when you test positive? Carry on as before - and I should know. Part of the job of a medical correspondent is getting involved. That means volunteering for medical trials, tests and so on. I forget the number of times I've rolled up my sleeve to give blood to illustrate some story, or gone into an MRI scanner to image my brain. It's what we call ""show and tell"" in the TV trade. So when home antibody tests were first in the news I set out to show how they worked.  The tests all vary a bit in how you perform them.  All you need is a drop or two of blood, which you squeeze into a hole, add a bit of chemical and then within a few minutes you get your result.A positive result comes, as with a pregnancy test, if you get two lines across the sample window. I did the finger-prick test on camera and was surprised, and pleased, to find that I was positive for antibodies. I've since done further reports on antibody testing and had the same positive result each time. You can see the photo - excuse the blood - of three positive results, although one of them does have a faint line.  Imperial College London are testing these finger-prick home antibody tests for accuracy and ease of use. One of the team there calculated that my repeated positive tests made it incredibly unlikely that I was continually producing a false result. In other words, it seems I have definitely had coronavirus.As the BBC's medical correspondent, since 2004 I have reported on global disease threats such as bird flu, swine flu, Sars and Mers - both coronaviruses - and Ebola. You could say I've been waiting much of my career for a global pandemic. And yet when Covid-19 came along, the world was not as ready as it could have been. Now it's here I wish, like everyone else, it would go away. Sadly, we may have to live with coronavirus indefinitely. In this column I will be reflecting on that new reality. So when was this?  I've not had any symptoms in recent months. I'm rarely ill, but I did have a bout of pneumonia in early January. I was off sick for about 10 days and had a cough and a high temperature. I couldn't shake it off. My GP in Windsor diagnosed a bacterial infection and gave me antibiotics. These helped a bit, but in late January I needed another course of antibiotics.  These seem to have done the trick. Was it really Covid-19?   I don't think so. The first confirmed case of coronavirus in the UK was in late January when two people from China fell ill in York. It wasn't until a month later that the first cases of domestic transmission occurred.  Note that although I'd been reporting on the outbreak in China by mid-January, the farthest afield I'd been in recent months was Christmas in Brussels.So I don't think I missed a story here - the first coronavirus case in the UK was not me.  But after that I've had no symptoms at all. Not a cough, not a high temperature, smell and taste normal, and no aches and pains, headaches, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, skin rash or any of the other possible warning signs listed by the World Health Organization.   So when I pricked my finger, I had no expectation that I'd get a positive result. I was gobsmacked to be honest. The test I did showed up positive for IgG antibodies - these are the ones that form at least two weeks AFTER an infection. I can tell you that having a positive test did not change my mindset. I still, when I walk around, assume that everybody I meet has coronavirus, and that I have it. I don't want to infect anyone, and I don't want them to infect me.I am still an obsessive hand-washer - having told the British public repeatedly about the importance of social distancing and hygiene, I feel I need to set an example.  Every public toilet I go to involves a demonstration of what I hope is perfect hand-washing.  I don't actually sing happy birthday twice out loud, but I do hum it in my head.Early on in the UK coronavirus epidemic, there was much discussion of how antibody tests might eventually help get us out of lockdown.  In March the government was talking confidently of antibody tests being a game-changer, as they would help indicate who had been previously infected with Covid-19 and therefore was protected.  Unfortunately it was not that simple.The government bought 3.5 million finger-prick antibody tests, but when they were evaluated by scientists in Oxford, they said none of those tested was sufficiently accurate.Things have moved on a lot since then. There are now several laboratory based antibody tests which seem fairly reliable.  Public Health England has evaluated antibody tests from Roche and Abbott.  Both require a blood draw, so they are not finger-prick home tests.  The sample has to be sent to a laboratory for analysis.  You can now also buy home antibody tests that you have to send to a laboratory. These are quite accurate, but you don't get an instant result. The accuracy of a test is based on its specificity and sensitivity.  With coronavirus, you want to ensure an antibody test is highly specific so that you don't get any false positives. This could be dangerous, as it would mean some people are told they have antibodies when they don't. They might be lulled into a false sense of security, take fewer precautions to guard against infection.  Both the Roche and Abbott tests are highly specific, with near 100% accuracy. This is very reassuring. Then we come to sensitivity. This is the likelihood of a test giving a false negative.  The PHE evaluation showed the Roche test to be 87% sensitive with samples taken 21 days after symptom onset while the Abbott test was 93%. This means that some people who definitely had antibodies to coronavirus may get ""false negative"" results. This is less important, but it is nonetheless an error. Both companies have said they can provide 10 million tests to the UK and the government has said antibody testing will be rolled out to frontline health workers from next week. But to what end?  If you have the Roche or Abbott test and get a positive result, you can be pretty confident that you have had Covid-19. This will be especially useful to anyone who did not have the up-the-nose and back-of-the-throat swab test. Remember that is for current infection, whether you have Covid-19 right now. The antibody test tells you about past infection. Furthermore you need to wait several weeks for those antibodies to show up on a test.  So that's great then. A reliable positive antibody test means you are free from lockdown, free to meet up with friends knowing you won't be infectious and are unlikely to spread the disease, right?Not so fast.  It's just not that simple. There is no consensus on what a positive antibody test means for an individual. Some virologists I've spoken to reckon it will give you a degree of protection from coronavirus, and in particular from severe symptoms, but whether that will last for months or years is uncertain.With Sars, antibody levels started to disappear after two or three years. There's another complication. Current antibody tests don't distinguish between the presence of neutralising antibodies, which would clear any new infection, and non-neutralising antibodies.We also don't know the importance of T-cell responses - another part of the immune system, which doesn't involve antibodies.So, having antibodies to coronavirus might not be the get-out-of-lockdown pass you might have assumed.Everyone I have spoken to has said no-one should change their behaviour based on a positive antibody test.So what's the use of rolling out antibody tests to healthcare workers?Firstly, it will really help build a picture of how many people in the UK have had coronavirus.  Current estimates are sketchy, and range from around 17% in London to 5% elsewhere in England.  That's a huge way off the 65% or thereabouts estimated to be required for herd immunity - IF it turns out that people with antibodies are indeed immune.It will also give us the first really accurate picture of how many people have had coronavirus without knowing it, so-called asymptomatic cases - people, it seems, like me.Follow @BBCFergusWalsh on Twitter",23 May 2020,health
Coronavirus: Five things a Covid-19 symptom-tracking app tells us,"The UK's scientists have been trying to trace Covid-19's path through the population ever since the coronavirus arrived on British shores.In what is thought to be the largest study of its kind in the world, an app developed by King's College London (KCL) and technology company Zoe, which tracks symptoms of the disease, has been downloaded more than three million times in the UK.Not to be confused with the government's contact-tracing app, the Covid-19 Symptom Study app allows users to report daily whether they feel healthy, and record any symptoms.The scientists have been using the data to estimate how the virus may have travelled through the population. Here are some of the things the app has taught us so far:When Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the UK lockdown on Monday 23 March, there were ""a lot of infected people who suddenly were stuck together, and they infected each other"", says KCL epidemiologist Prof Tim Spector.The peak of the epidemic came nine days later, the researchers believe, on 1 April. They estimate more than two million people aged 20-69 had Covid-19 symptoms in the UK at this point - or 50 in every 1,000 people. The researchers found their app recorded a peak in infections around two weeks before the peak in hospital admissions, which Prof Spector says shows it is an ""early warning device"" for future changes in levels of the disease.The average incubation period of the virus is five days but in some people symptoms take longer to show, meaning that a proportion of cases in the early days of lockdown were caught before it started. After 1 April, the number of infections plummeted in all the regions, but from different levels. Now the rate of the fall in estimated infections is decreasing, says Prof Spector.""It was halving every week and then it slowed down. That rate of slowing is interesting - there are still some residual infections going on.""The number of cases in the general population is potentially being ""driven"" by problems in hospitals and care homes, he says.The team estimates about 280,000 - or 0.7% - of people aged 20-69 have symptoms of the Covid-19, although they warn their model is less accurate when levels of the virus are low in the population.Researchers at King's College London and partners used data gathered on their symptom recording app to estimate the level of coronavirus infection in the UK over time. They estimate that the virus peaked at about 2.1 million cases on 1 April and then rapidly fell over the next three weeks as the lockdown took effect. Cases plateaued in early May.If you can't see the slideshow, tap hereThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) gives us a lower estimate, although so far it has only surveyed England. A swab test survey of nearly 15,000 people aged over two in the two weeks to 17 May, suggested 137,000 people in England - 0.25% - were infected. The same study by the ONS suggests there are 8,700 new infections a day on average in England, while a study by KCL on a group of 980,000 app-users suggests there are 9,900.Both estimates come with margins of error of plus or minus a few thousand, so they are not as different as they might seem.By Maryam Ahmed, BBC News data scientistThe model predicts whether a person has coronavirus using their age, gender, and the symptoms they enter into the app. This gives a daily estimate of how many users aged between 20-69 have coronavirus in each local authority and age bracket. Researchers scale these figures up, using the population and age breakdown in each local authority, to predict the number of coronavirus cases in the general population.Like all models, it doesn't get it right every time. The researchers say it will miss about 35% of people with coronavirus, and flag about 22% of healthy people. Since the predictions are based on app users, who tend to be younger and more affluent, the model might be less accurate when scaled up to the general population. The model doesn't make predictions for people under 20 or over 69, because of a lack of data.KCL have been publishing their estimates on a daily basis, so the findings have not yet been peer-reviewed.Areas that hosted sports events in the days before mass gatherings were cancelled, became infection hotspots, according to the research. Data suggested a high rate of infections in Cheltenham following the Gold Cup horse racing event, and a rise in Liverpool after a Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League football game.Liverpool City Council has since launched an investigation into the outbreak, but Gloucestershire County Council - which oversees the Cheltenham Festival - said any investigation should be led at a national level.A map of the symptom-tracking app data demonstrates that, at the peak of the epidemic, the estimated cases were clustered in cities including London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Glasgow. But the researchers were surprised by a heavy concentration of estimated cases in south Wales - around a week before the height of hospital activity in the area.""We never really understood why it was a hotspot. No-one's come up with a convincing explanation,"" says Prof Spector.Although the government initially warned the key symptoms of Covid-19 were a fever or continuous cough, data collected by the symptom-tracking app suggests the disease has a wide range of symptoms. Fatigue, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, delirium, skipped meals, abdominal pain, chest pain and a hoarse voice were all associated with the virus.But the strongest warning signs of infection are a loss of taste or smell, according to findings from the team, published in the journal Nature Medicine. These symptoms were added to the UK's list of those that people should self-isolate with on Monday, several weeks after Prof Spector and other experts had called for the guidance to be changed.The KCL scientists have also noticed there are patterns in the different symptoms people with Covid-19 have, which they think form six distinct groups. They hope soon to be able to predict how the disease will progress in a person, based on the symptoms they have on the first day.Interactive produced by Christine Jeavans and Maryam Ahmed.
