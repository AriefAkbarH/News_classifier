Coronavirus: WHO halts trials of hydroxychloroquine over safety fears,"Testing of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for coronavirus has been halted because of safety fears, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.Trials in several countries are being ""temporarily"" suspended as a precaution, the agency said on Monday.It comes after a recent medical study suggested the drug could increase the risk of patients dying from Covid-19.President Donald Trump has said he is taking the drug to ward off the virus.The US president has repeatedly promoted the anti-malarial drug, against medical advice and despite warnings from public health officials that it could cause heart problems.Last week, a study in medical journal The Lancet said there were no benefits to treating coronavirus patients with hydroxychloroquine, and that taking it might even increase the number of deaths among those in hospital with the disease.Hydroxychloroquine is safe for malaria, and conditions like lupus or arthritis, but no clinical trials have recommended its use for treating Covid-19.The WHO, which is running clinical trials of various drugs to assess which might be beneficial in treating the disease, has previously raised concerns over reports of individuals self-medicating and causing themselves serious harm.On Monday, officials at the UN health agency said hydroxychloroquine would be removed from those trials pending a safety assessment. The Lancet study involved 96,000 coronavirus patients, nearly 15,000 of whom were given hydroxychloroquine - or a related form chloroquine - either alone or with an antibiotic.The study found that the patients were more likely to die in hospital and develop heart rhythm complications than other Covid patients in a comparison group.The death rates of the treated groups were: hydroxychloroquine 18%; chloroquine 16.4%; control group 9%. Those treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in combination with antibiotics had an even higher death rate.The researchers warned that hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside of clinical trials.",25 May 2020,health

Coronavirus: Immune clue sparks treatment hope,"UK scientists are to begin testing a treatment that it is hoped could counter the effects of Covid-19 in the most seriously ill patients.It has been found those with the most severe form of the disease have extremely low numbers of an immune cell called a T-cell. T-cells clear infection from the body.The clinical trial will evaluate if a drug called interleukin 7, known to boost T-cell numbers, can aid patients' recovery.It involves scientists from the Francis Crick Institute, King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.They have looked at immune cells in the blood of 60 Covid-19 patients and found an apparent crash in the numbers of T-cells. Prof Adrian Hayday from the Crick Institute said it was a ""great surprise"" to see what was happening with the immune cells.""They're trying to protect us, but the virus seems to be doing something that's pulling the rug from under them, because their numbers have declined dramatically.In a microlitre (0.001ml) drop of blood, normal healthy adults have between 2,000 and 4,000 T-cells, also called T lymphocytes. The Covid patients the team tested had between 200-1,200. The researchers say these findings pave the way for them to develop a ""fingerprint test"" to check the levels of T-cells in the blood which could provide early indications of who might go on to develop more severe disease. It also provides the possibility for a specific treatment to reverse that immune cell decline.  Manu Shankar-Hari, a critical care consultant at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, said that around 70% of patients that he sees in intensive care with Covid-19 arrive with between 400-800 lymphocytes per microlitre. ""When they start to recover, their lymphocyte level also starts to go back up,"" he added. Interleukin 7 has already been tested in a small group of patients with sepsis and proved to safely increase the production of these specific cells. In this trial, it will be given to patients with a low lymphocyte count who have been in critical care for more than three days.Mr Shankar-Hari said: ""We are hoping that [when we increase the cell count] the viral infections gets cleared.""As a critical care physician, I look after patients who are extremely unwell and, other than supportive care, we do not have any direct active treatment against the disease. ""So a treatment like this coming along for it in the context of a clinical trial is extremely encouraging for critical care physicians across the UK.""This research has also provided insight into the specific ways in which this disease interacts with the immune system, that Prof Hayday says will be vital as scientists around the world look for clinically valuable information. ""The virus that has caused this completely Earth-changing emergency is unique - it's  different. It is something unprecedented."" ""The exact reason for this disruption - the  spanner in the works of the T-cell system - is not at all clear to us.""This virus is really doing something distinct and future research - which we will start immediately - needs to find out the mechanism by which this virus is having these effects.""",22 May 2020,health
Coronavirus: Children and older adults to take part in vaccine trial,"Children and older adults are to be included in the second phase of vaccine trials to protect against coronavirus.The first phase of the University of Oxford trial began in April, involving 1,000 healthy adults aged 55 and under.Now more than 10,200 people - including over 70s and five to 12-year-olds - will be enrolled in the study, to see the effects on their immune system.Trials of the same vaccine on monkeys appear to have given them some protection against the disease.The animals had less of the virus in their lungs and airways, but it is not certain this finding will translate to people.The scientists behind the vaccine have previously said they are aiming to have at least a million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by September this year.But the UK government has repeatedly said there are no guarantees - and a vaccine could still be some way off.And most experts still estimate it will take 12 to 18 months to develop and manufacture a vaccine.There are more than 100 experimental vaccines against Covid-19 currently being developed worldwide.Adults in this trial will receive one or two doses of either the new vaccine - ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 - or another licensed vaccine.Researchers will then compare the number of infections in both groups. This could take between two and to six months, depending on how many people are exposed to the virus.The age range of participants has been expanded to include those aged:Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology, at the Jenner Institute, said: ""We have had a lot of interest already from people over the age of 55 years who were not eligible to take part in the phase-one study.""And we will now be able to include older age groups to continue the vaccine assessment.

Coronavirus: Hydroxychloroquine trial begins in the UK,"A trial to see whether two anti-malarial drugs could prevent Covid-19 has begun in Brighton and Oxford.Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or a placebo will be given to more than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.All the participants are staff who are in contact with Covid-19 patients.US President Donald Trump was criticised this week after he said he had been taking hydroxychloroquine, despite warnings it might be unsafe.The first UK participants in the global trial are being enrolled on Thursday at the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals and the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.  They will be given either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo for three months. At sites in Asia, participants will be given chloroquine or a placebo.These are the first of a planned 25 UK sites, with results expected by the end of the year. The trial is open to anyone delivering direct care to coronavirus patients in the UK, as long as they have not been diagnosed with Covid-19. It will test whether the drugs can prevent healthcare workers exposed to the virus from contracting it. One of the study's leaders, Prof Nicholas White at the University of Oxford said: ""We really do not know if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are beneficial or harmful against Covid-19.""But, he said, a randomised controlled trial such as this one, where neither the participant nor the researchers know who has been given the drug or a placebo, was the best way to find out. ""A widely available, safe and effective vaccine may be a long way off,"" said Prof Martin Llewelyn from Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who is also leading the study.  ""If drugs as well-tolerated as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could reduce the chances of catching Covid-19, this would be incredibly valuable."" The drugs can reduce fever and inflammation and are used as both a prevention and a treatment for malaria. Hydroxychloroquine regulates the body's immune response and is also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Lupus - an inflammatory disease caused by an overactive immune system. Lupus charities in the UK and US have raised concerns that demand for the drug associated with coronavirus could threaten the supply for patients who already rely on it. The drug gained attention after US President Donald Trump suggested it may be beneficial, and this week said he was taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus.The US Food and Drug Administration warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases, or clinical trials.While the University of Oxford trial is taking place in a controlled clinical environment, the World Health Organization has warned that some individuals were self-medicating and risked causing themselves serious harm.It has not yet been shown to be safe and effective in the prevention or treatment of coronavirus and can cause dangerous heart arrhythmias.

Coronavirus doctor's diary: The drug combination that may help us beat Covid-19,"Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary (BRI) describes some of the trials under way to find a cure for Covid-19, and suggests that a combination of three different types of drug may hold the key.At BRI we are now participating in eight different clinical trials to try and find a cure for Covid-19.We are part of a huge international effort. It feels like all the light of global science has been concentrated into a laser beam directed at this almost invisible virus.The biggest of the trials we are involved in is the Recovery trial. Already more than 10,000 patients have been recruited nationwide and are taking either a placebo or one of a number of other drugs. (I wrote about this important trial last month.)Last week at BRI we recruited the first patient in the UK for a small trial to test whether a new drug made by AstraZeneca is safe and effective. This is one of a number of small trials - jointly referred to as the Accord trial - designed to assess further drugs that may be added to the Recovery trial.The hope is that this AstraZeneca drug, which does not yet have a name, will help to damp down a dangerous overreaction of the immune system that occurs in a small proportion of patients, sending the body into shock and closing down vital organs, such as the lungs, heart, blood vessels and kidney. This overreaction has been referred to as a ""cytokine storm"" - cytokines being molecules that flag up the presence of an infection that the body must fight. The drug in the new trial blocks a cytokine called IL-33 (or interleukin-33).Mark Winterbourne, who volunteered to take the IL-blocker, arrived in hospital with symptoms that were at first thought to be caused by gallstones. It was only after he tested positive for Covid-19 that we realised this was the probable source of the problem. (Covid-19 is an illness with a wide variety of symptoms - but this is an unusual case!) Mark says volunteering comes naturally to him; while working as a volunteer photographer for the Great North Run, he met and became friends with Sir Mo Farah.I suspect that a vaccine for Covid-19 is still a year away, so these trials searching for treatments are critical.The doctors here are looking ahead to a time - not too far off, they hope - when anyone with early symptoms will be able to drive to a testing centre, get swabbed, get a quick result and a prescription for a combination of effective drugs, before the worst of their symptoms take hold.This combination may include an antiviral drug, an immune suppressing drug, and an anti-inflammatory drug.Among antivirals being tested, one may help prevent the coronavirus attaching to the lining of the lungs, and another may help to stop it reproducing in the body.Immune-suppressing drugs could help prevent the immune overreaction to the virus - the cytokine storm. If the IL-33 blocker from the Accord trial is effective, it would be a contender.Anti-inflammatory drugs include steroids - for example Dexamethasone, one of the first drugs included in the Recovery trial.Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio.It seems increasingly unlikely that a single drug will cure Covid-19. It's through combinations of drugs that in the past we have beaten TB - with a combination of antibiotics - and HIV - with a combination of antiretrovirals - and I expect it will be the way we beat this illness too.BRI Respiratory consultant Dinesh Saralaya feels optimistic that a combination treatment will be available before the end of the summer.""I think we'll find at least two or three drugs which will prevent these patients ever needing to come into hospital,"" he says.""You will go to the test centre and then be given the drugs once you're diagnosed. Under the current strategies, you get the Covid virus, so you're isolating, then you get worse, you get a temperature, you start getting breathless, then you come in. But people need to be given the drugs very early.""Another of our consultants is potentially contributing to another trial - as a donor of antibodies.Debbie Horner caught Covid-19 at a very early stage of the outbreak and quickly recovered. Two weeks ago, when a call went out for people like her to donate convalescent blood plasma, she immediately agreed.Researchers want to find out whether antibody-rich plasma from people who have had Covid-19 will help other patients fight off the disease. This work is also part of the Recovery trial.It's now been discovered that the patients most likely to have high levels of antibodies are men over the age of 35 who became so ill they needed hospital treatment. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) is keen to recruit donors who have recovered from Covid-19 and who are either male, or are over 35, or were ill enough to be hospitalised.Debbie had a mild case so it is possible that her plasma is not as rich in antibodies as the team would like. The results have yet to come in. If her plasma is wanted she will happily donate more. ""It's a bit different to taking blood normally,"" she says. ""They take out a fraction of the blood - the plasma fraction - and then they give you back all your red cells and other bits of blood that aren't required, so essentially, it's just like getting a bit dehydrated.""A few cups of tea are enough to fix that, Debbie says.Mike Murphy, professor of transfusion medicine at the University of Oxford, says this is a great opportunity to understand more about the value of plasma transfusions more generally. Plasma was collected in the late 2000s to see if it would be a way of treating people with Ebola and flu, he says.""But by the time there were enough convalescent donors who had recovered from the infection, and were able to donate, the peak of the infection had passed, and so there was no opportunity to test the benefit of convalescent plasma. The Covid-19 pandemic is obviously different.""Follow @docjohnwright and radio producer @SueM1tchell on Twitter",26 May 2020,health
Coronavirus: WHO halts trials of hydroxychloroquine over safety fears,"Testing of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for coronavirus has been halted because of safety fears, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.Trials in several countries are being ""temporarily"" suspended as a precaution, the agency said on Monday.It comes after a recent medical study suggested the drug could increase the risk of patients dying from Covid-19.President Donald Trump has said he is taking the drug to ward off the virus.The US president has repeatedly promoted the anti-malarial drug, against medical advice and despite warnings from public health officials that it could cause heart problems.Last week, a study in medical journal The Lancet said there were no benefits to treating coronavirus patients with hydroxychloroquine, and that taking it might even increase the number of deaths among those in hospital with the disease.Hydroxychloroquine is safe for malaria, and conditions like lupus or arthritis, but no clinical trials have recommended its use for treating Covid-19.The WHO, which is running clinical trials of various drugs to assess which might be beneficial in treating the disease, has previously raised concerns over reports of individuals self-medicating and causing themselves serious harm.On Monday, officials at the UN health agency said hydroxychloroquine would be removed from those trials pending a safety assessment. The Lancet study involved 96,000 coronavirus patients, nearly 15,000 of whom were given hydroxychloroquine - or a related form chloroquine - either alone or with an antibiotic.The study found that the patients were more likely to die in hospital and develop heart rhythm complications than other Covid patients in a comparison group.The death rates of the treated groups were: hydroxychloroquine 18%; chloroquine 16.4%; control group 9%. Those treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in combination with antibiotics had an even higher death rate.The researchers warned that hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside of clinical trials.",25 May 2020,health
