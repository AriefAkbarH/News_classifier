Coronavirus: Children affected by rare Kawasaki-like disease,"Scores of UK and US children have been affected by a rare inflammatory disease linked to coronavirus.In a tiny number of children it can cause serious complications, with some needing intensive care.Up to 100 children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in children elsewhere in Europe.It is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease.In April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children.This was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London, including a 14-year-old who died.They all had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain.Most of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues.Doctors are describing it as a ""new phenomenon"" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips.But this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications.Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked.""You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon,"" she said.This means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home.The syndrome is ""exceptionally rare"", he said.""This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown,"" Prof Viner added.He said understanding more about the inflammatory disease ""might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic"".Children are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital.Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies.""So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus,"" he said.However Prof Levin said there was ""a vast amount to learn"" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks.Children appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases.There have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands.At least 15 US states are looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo.Out of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week.Meanwhile, according to a study by doctors in northern Italy, 10 children have been affected by the disease.All 10 of the children in the study were admitted to a hospital in Bergamo - the city at the centre of the worst outbreak in Italy - between mid-February and mid-April, and recovered.The children, who had an average age of seven, tended to have severe symptoms such as heart complications and signs of toxic shock syndrome. They also needed additional treatment with steroids.In antibody tests on the children, eight appeared to have already had the coronavirus while the other two had not. But the researchers said the tests were not 100% accurate. Swab tests to detect the virus are not thought to be useful because the reaction tends to occur many weeks after infection.Dr Lucio Verdoni, report author and doctor at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, said: ""Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children.""Child health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children.They are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).

Coronavirus antibody test a 'positive development',"A test to find out whether people have been infected with coronavirus in the past has been approved by health officials in England.Public Health England said the antibody test, developed by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, was a ""very positive development"".The blood test looks for antibodies to see if a person has already had the virus and might now have some immunity. Until now, officials have said such tests are not reliable enough.The government previously spent a reported £16m buying antibody tests which later proved to be ineffective.Sources told the BBC the Roche test was the first one to offer serious potential.Antibodies are made by our immune system as it learns to fight an infection. Finding antibodies that attack the coronavirus show that person has been infected in the past, but they do not prove they are protected against it in the future.Experts at the government's Porton Down facility evaluated the Roche test last week, Public Health England said.They found that if someone had been infected, it gave the correct result 100% of the time.Roche said if someone had not caught coronavirus then it gave the correct result more than 99.8% of the time. It means fewer than two in 1,000 healthy people would be incorrectly told they had previously caught the coronavirus.Health minister Edward Argar said the tests would mainly be used on those in the NHS and social care settings to begin with.He could not give an exact date for when the testing could start.Prof John Newton, national coordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, said: ""This is a very positive development because such a highly specific antibody test is a very reliable marker of past infection.""This in turn may indicate some immunity to future infection, although the extent to which the presence of antibodies indicates immunity remains unclear.""Roche is understood to be in talks with the Department of Health and Social Care about possible use by the NHS in England, though other testing products are also being assessed.Health officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions, but are likely to follow suit if England does adopt it.The test already has approval from medical regulators in the EU and the United States.The main use of an antibody test is to find out how many people have been infected.The official figures are only a fraction of the total number - not everybody is getting tested and some people are being infected without developing symptoms.Antibody tests will help answer questions such as how far and how easily the virus has spread and, crucially, how deadly it really is.The second use - helping to lift lockdown - is highly controversial.The idea is if you have antibodies, then you can go back to work. This could be particularly helpful in hospitals and care homes full of vulnerable people, if you could guarantee the staff were immune. But having antibodies does not automatically mean you cannot get sick or harbour the virus and pass it on to others.World Health Organization scientists advise against using so called ""immunity passports"" because of the lack of evidence.The swab tests currently being carried out in the UK determine whether someone has the virus at the time of the test.These will remain the core part of the government's test, track and trace strategy for containing the spread of the virus.Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, described the test as a ""major step forward"".But although it could determine whether someone had had the infection, it did not determine ""for sure"" whether they would be protected from the virus in future, he said.""We have still yet to completely understand what a positive result actually means,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""So we're not there yet.""Last week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK was in talks with Roche about a ""very large-scale roll-out"" of coronavirus antibody testing.But he acknowledged there had been ""false hope before"" and that he would only make an announcement when the government was ""absolutely ready"".The Department of Health and Social Care said antibody testing was an important part of its coronavirus strategy and an announcement would be made ""in due course"".In other developments: ",14 May 2020,health
Coronavirus: A&E visits in England down to record low,"A&E visits in England have halved since the coronavirus outbreak started, dropping to their lowest level since records began.Before the pandemic, more than 2.1m patients a month were visiting A&E. In April that dropped to 916,581.Everything from cancer care to routine surgery has been disrupted by coronavirus, although ministers have called for services to be restored. But re-starting NHS services could take many months, experts say.Three think tanks said reorganising care and the need for protective kit and extra cleaning meant it would take time before the NHS was back fully.NHE England data also shows urgent cancer referrals by GPs and routine operations have slowed.It comes as NHS bosses have once again urged patients to seek urgent medical treatment if they need it.There is particular concern that patients who have suffered strokes and heart problems have stayed away because of fears over coronavirus.NHS England clinical director for stroke Dr Deb Lowe said she and fellow doctors were ""really worried"" that the numbers seeking help for stroke care had gone down. Figures published on Thursday showed A&E visits in England have halved since the outbreak began.During April, there were 916,581 attendances - the lowest since records began in 2010.Before the coronavirus outbreak, more than 2.1m patients a month were visiting A&E. In March that dropped to 1.53m.Data for other areas lags a month behind - so for routine treatments and cancer care NHS England has only been able to publish the data for March. Lockdown was announced in late March.GPs made 181,873 urgent cancer referrals during March - down from 196,425 on the same month in 2019.The number of patients admitted for routine surgery and treatment, such as knee and hip operations, dropped by a third to 207,754, down from 305,356 in March 2019.Hospitals were told to start stopping routine care to free up beds for the coronavirus peak.Meanwhile, community services have had to be scaled back as staff have been redeployed and face-to-face contact has had to be restricted.Health visitors, for example, have been having to carry out most of their consultations with new mothers via phone or using video technology.Macmillan Cancer Support chief executive Lynda Thomas said despite urgent cancer care being prioritised during the lockdown, services were still affected, while she fears some patients were put off seeking help.'Cancer must not become the forgotten 'C' in this pandemic.""The think tanks - the Nuffield Trust, King's Fund and Health Foundation - said tackling the backlog in cases and restoring services was going to take time.They warned staff were exhausted because they had been working flat out and needed time to recover.The availability of protective kit, such as aprons and goggles, would need to be improved and expanded, while changes would need to be made to allow for social distancing.What is more, capacity would still need to be set aside for a second peak.The NHS is expected to use the space at the 10 field hospitals - known as Nightingales in England - to provide some of this. Only two of them are currently being used.Nuffield Trust chief executive Nigel Edwards said: ""With the virus still at large there is no easy route back to the way things were before.""Unfortunately that will mean people waiting much longer and some services being put on hold.""Has your operation been delayed?
