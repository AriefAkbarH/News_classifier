Coronavirus: Lockdowns in Europe saved millions of lives,"Lockdowns have saved more than three million lives from coronavirus in Europe, a study estimates.The team at Imperial College London said the ""death toll would have been huge"" without lockdown. But they warned that only a small proportion of people had been infected and we were still only ""at the beginning of the pandemic"".Another study argued global lockdowns had ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".The Imperial study assessed the impact of restrictions in 11 European countries - Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK - up to the beginning of May.By that time, around 130,000 people had died from coronavirus in those countries.The researchers used disease modelling to predict how many deaths there would have been if lockdown had not happened. And the work comes from the same group that guided the UK's decision to go into lockdown.They estimated 3.2 million people would have died by 4 May if not for measures such as closing businesses and telling people to stay at home.That meant lockdown saved around 3.1 million lives, including 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France and 630,000 in Italy, the report in the journal Nature shows. ""Lockdown averted millions of deaths, those deaths would have been a tragedy,"" said Dr Seth Flaxman, from Imperial.Their equations made several assumptions, which will affect the figures. They assume nobody would have changed their behaviour in response to the Covid threat without a lockdown - and that hospitals would not be overwhelmed resulting in a surge in deaths, which nearly happened in some countries. The study also does not take into account the health consequences of lockdowns that may take years to fully uncover. The model also predicted that the outbreak would be nearly over by now without lockdown, as so many people would have been infected.More than seven in 10 people in the UK would have had Covid, leading to herd immunity and the virus no longer spreading. Instead, the researchers estimate that up to 15 million people across Europe had been infected by the beginning of May.The researchers say at most, 4% of the population in those countries had been infected. ""Claims this is all over can be firmly rejected. We are only at the beginning of this pandemic,"" said Dr Flaxman.And it means that as lockdowns start to lift, there is the risk the virus could start to spread again.""There is a very real risk if mobility goes back up there could be a second wave coming reasonably soon, in the next month or two,"" said Dr Samir Bhatt.Meanwhile, a separate study by University of California, Berkeley, analysed the impact of lockdowns in China, South Korea, Iran, France and the US.Their report, also in Nature, says lockdown prevented 530 million infections in those countries. Just before lockdowns were introduced, they said cases were doubling every two days.

Coronavirus: Risk higher for pregnant BAME women,"The high proportion of pregnant women from black and ethnic minority (BAME) groups admitted to hospital with Covid-19 ""needs urgent investigation"", says a study in the British Medical Journal.Out of 427 pregnant women studied between March and April, more than half were from these backgrounds - nearly three times the expected number.Most were admitted late in pregnancy and did not become seriously ill.Although babies can be infected, the researchers said this was ""uncommon"".The findings, based on data for pregnant women with coronavirus admitted to 194 obstetric units across the UK over six weeks, show:In normal times, 20% of women giving birth are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds (BAME), lead author Prof Marian Knight, professor of maternal and child population health from the University of Oxford, says.When other factors such as obesity and age were taken into account, there was still a much higher proportion from ethnic minority groups than expected, the authors said.And this was still the case when pregnant women in hospitals in big cities were excluded from the analysis.This suggests the effect is not just down to higher infection rates in urban areas, Prof Knight said.But the explanation for why BAME pregnant women are disproportionately affected by coronavirus is not simple ""or easily solved"", she added.""We have to talk to women themselves, as well as health professionals, to give us more of a clue.""Prof Knight also said it was wrong to talk about BAME women as if they were all one group and all the same. Disparities could be linked to factors such as employment, multi-generational households, transport use and culture.""Covid is the lens showing us how important disparities are,"" Prof Knight said.She said women from certain communities might be less reluctant to seek help and advice early if they felt unwell.Karen Mannering tested positive for Covid-19 in March, six months into her pregnancy.

Coronavirus: WHO advises to wear masks in public areas,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus.The global body said new information showed they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"".Some countries already recommend or mandate face coverings in public.The WHO had previously argued there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks.However, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that ""in light of evolving evidence, the WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments"".The organisation had always advised that medical face masks should be worn by people who are sick and by those caring for them.Globally, there have been 6.7 million confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 400,000 deaths since the outbreak began late last year, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The organisation said its new guidance had been prompted by studies over recent weeks. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead expert on Covid-19, told Reuters news agency the recommendation was for people to wear a ""fabric mask - that is, a non-medical mask"".Fabric masks should consist of ""at least three layers of different material"" in order to be effective, the WHO says.However, those aged over-60 and with underlying health risks should wear medical masks in areas where there is community transmission.At the same time, the WHO stressed that face masks were just one of a range of tools that could be used to reduce the risk of transmission - and that they should not give people a false sense of protection.""Masks on their own will not protect you from Covid-19,"" Dr Tedros said.This is a big shift in the WHO's guidance on when the public should cover their faces. For months, the organisation's experts stuck to the line that masks would encourage a false sense of security and would deprive medical professionals of badly needed protective equipment.Those arguments have not gone away but at the same time the WHO acknowledges that new evidence has emerged on the risks of transmission.It points to recent research that people can be highly infectious in the few days before they show symptoms and that some people catch the virus but never show symptoms at all, as I reported last weekend.So where distancing is not possible, such as on public transport and in locations as varied as shops and refugee camps, it is suggested that faces are covered with homemade masks to avoid passing on the infection.Over 60s with underlying health conditions should go further, the WHO said, and wear medical-grade masks to give themselves better protection.In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro threatened to pull the country out of the WHO unless it ceased to be a ""partisan political organisation"". The leader, who had initially dismissed the virus as a ""little flu"", has been critical of the lockdown policies recommended by the agency to tackle the spread of the disease.Last week, US President Donald Trump said he would end ties with the WHO, saying it had failed to hold China - where the outbreak begun - to account over coronavirus.In the UK, the government announced on Friday that hospital visitors and outpatients would be required to wear face coverings, and that hospital staff would have to wear medical masks, even if they were not in a clinical setting.The guidance will come into force on 15 June, as more businesses open up and more pupils return to school. Also on Friday the UK became the second country to record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths, after the US.The court of appeal in New South Wales, Australia, overturned a ban on a Black Lives Matter protest, which was imposed due to coronavirus concerns. Thousands flooded the streets of Sydney to commemorate African American George Floyd, who died in US police custody.In other news:How have you been affected by coronavirus?

Coronavirus: Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine 'does not save lives',"A malaria drug that has been tested as a treatment for coronavirus does not save lives, one of the world's largest trials shows.Hydroxychloroquine received global attention after being promoted by Donald Trump, and then controversy after studies on it were retracted.The drug has now been pulled from the UK's Recovery trial, which is run by the University of Oxford.The findings have been passed on to the World Health Organization.Back at the start of the pandemic, laboratory studies had suggested the malaria drug could affect the virus. Small-scale studies in China and France then hinted it might help patients.There was a huge amount of hope, as the medicine is cheap and has been safely used to treat malaria and conditions such as lupus and arthritis.However, the evidence supporting its use for coronavirus has been weak.That is why the data from the Recovery trial is crucial. It is the first to test the drug in large numbers of people in a thorough clinical trial.More than 11,000 patients with Covid-19 are taking part, with 1,542 patients given hydroxychloroquine. Due to mounting controversy about the drug, the UK's drugs regulator last night asked the Oxford researchers to review their data. The results showed 25.7% of people taking hydroxychloroquine had died after 28 days. This compared with 23.5% who were given standard hospital treatment. ""This is not a treatment for Covid,"" said Prof Martin Landray, part of the Recovery trial. The trial immediately stopped using the drug. The findings come in the wake of deep concern in academic publishing that led to an article being retracted in the Lancet - one of the world's most prestigious medical journals.It had published a study involving nearly 15,000 patients, from hundreds of hospitals, given hydroxycholoroquine or the similar drug chloroquine. It concluded the drug was not beneficial and increased the risk of irregular heart rhythms and death. That publication led to the WHO suspending its trials of the anti-malaria drug.The data had been collected from hospitals by the little-known healthcare firm Surgisphere. Concerns were raised about the data and then some of the study's authors said they could no longer stand by their publication as Surgisphere would not allow an independent review.Then the New England Journal of Medicine retracted another paper that had data based on Surgisphere. Prof Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford which runs the Recovery trial, said: ""Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have received a lot of attention and have been used very widely to treat Covid patients despite the absence of any good evidence. ""Although it is disappointing that this treatment has been shown to be ineffective, it does allow us to focus care and research on more promising drugs.""Follow James on Twitter.",5 June 2020,health
Vaccine summit exceeds target to raise almost £7bn,"Almost £7bn has been raised to immunise 300 million children at a virtual global vaccine summit hosted by the UK.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said up to eight million lives would be saved as a result of the funds pledged at the Gavi vaccine summit on Thursday.The money will help immunise children against diseases like polio, diphtheria and measles over five years.Mr Johnson said the triumph of humanity over disease was the ""greatest shared endeavour of our lifetimes"".The summit raised funds for Gavi, a global alliance of public and private sector organisations promoting vaccination among the world's poorest communities.Pledges by more than 50 countries and individuals like billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates saw the total surpass an initial target of $7.4bn (almost £6bn).Mr Gates donated $1.6bn (£1.3bn) from his foundation and Mr Johnson pledged £1.65bn over the next five years, making the UK the organisation's biggest donor.The summit comes as the world continues to struggle to get to grips with the coronavirus pandemic.Mr Johnson also used the conference to urge world leaders to renew their ""collective resolve"" to find a Covid-19 vaccine.""Just as we have great military alliances like Nato... where countries collaborate on building their collective military defence, so we now need that same spirit of collaboration and collective defence against the common enemy of disease,"" he said.""It will require a new international effort to co-operate on the surveillance and the sharing of information - data is king - that can underpin a global alert system, so we can rapidly identify any future outbreak.

Coronavirus: Risk higher for pregnant BAME women,"The high proportion of pregnant women from black and ethnic minority (BAME) groups admitted to hospital with Covid-19 ""needs urgent investigation"", says a study in the British Medical Journal.Out of 427 pregnant women studied between March and April, more than half were from these backgrounds - nearly three times the expected number.Most were admitted late in pregnancy and did not become seriously ill.Although babies can be infected, the researchers said this was ""uncommon"".The findings, based on data for pregnant women with coronavirus admitted to 194 obstetric units across the UK over six weeks, show:In normal times, 20% of women giving birth are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds (BAME), lead author Prof Marian Knight, professor of maternal and child population health from the University of Oxford, says.When other factors such as obesity and age were taken into account, there was still a much higher proportion from ethnic minority groups than expected, the authors said.And this was still the case when pregnant women in hospitals in big cities were excluded from the analysis.This suggests the effect is not just down to higher infection rates in urban areas, Prof Knight said.But the explanation for why BAME pregnant women are disproportionately affected by coronavirus is not simple ""or easily solved"", she added.""We have to talk to women themselves, as well as health professionals, to give us more of a clue.""Prof Knight also said it was wrong to talk about BAME women as if they were all one group and all the same. Disparities could be linked to factors such as employment, multi-generational households, transport use and culture.""Covid is the lens showing us how important disparities are,"" Prof Knight said.She said women from certain communities might be less reluctant to seek help and advice early if they felt unwell.Karen Mannering tested positive for Covid-19 in March, six months into her pregnancy.

Coronavirus: WHO advises to wear masks in public areas,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus.The global body said new information showed they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"".Some countries already recommend or mandate face coverings in public.The WHO had previously argued there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks.However, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that ""in light of evolving evidence, the WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments"".The organisation had always advised that medical face masks should be worn by people who are sick and by those caring for them.Globally, there have been 6.7 million confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 400,000 deaths since the outbreak began late last year, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The organisation said its new guidance had been prompted by studies over recent weeks. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead expert on Covid-19, told Reuters news agency the recommendation was for people to wear a ""fabric mask - that is, a non-medical mask"".Fabric masks should consist of ""at least three layers of different material"" in order to be effective, the WHO says.However, those aged over-60 and with underlying health risks should wear medical masks in areas where there is community transmission.At the same time, the WHO stressed that face masks were just one of a range of tools that could be used to reduce the risk of transmission - and that they should not give people a false sense of protection.""Masks on their own will not protect you from Covid-19,"" Dr Tedros said.This is a big shift in the WHO's guidance on when the public should cover their faces. For months, the organisation's experts stuck to the line that masks would encourage a false sense of security and would deprive medical professionals of badly needed protective equipment.Those arguments have not gone away but at the same time the WHO acknowledges that new evidence has emerged on the risks of transmission.It points to recent research that people can be highly infectious in the few days before they show symptoms and that some people catch the virus but never show symptoms at all, as I reported last weekend.So where distancing is not possible, such as on public transport and in locations as varied as shops and refugee camps, it is suggested that faces are covered with homemade masks to avoid passing on the infection.Over 60s with underlying health conditions should go further, the WHO said, and wear medical-grade masks to give themselves better protection.In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro threatened to pull the country out of the WHO unless it ceased to be a ""partisan political organisation"". The leader, who had initially dismissed the virus as a ""little flu"", has been critical of the lockdown policies recommended by the agency to tackle the spread of the disease.Last week, US President Donald Trump said he would end ties with the WHO, saying it had failed to hold China - where the outbreak begun - to account over coronavirus.In the UK, the government announced on Friday that hospital visitors and outpatients would be required to wear face coverings, and that hospital staff would have to wear medical masks, even if they were not in a clinical setting.The guidance will come into force on 15 June, as more businesses open up and more pupils return to school. Also on Friday the UK became the second country to record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths, after the US.The court of appeal in New South Wales, Australia, overturned a ban on a Black Lives Matter protest, which was imposed due to coronavirus concerns. Thousands flooded the streets of Sydney to commemorate African American George Floyd, who died in US police custody.In other news:How have you been affected by coronavirus?

Coronavirus: Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine 'does not save lives',"A malaria drug that has been tested as a treatment for coronavirus does not save lives, one of the world's largest trials shows.Hydroxychloroquine received global attention after being promoted by Donald Trump, and then controversy after studies on it were retracted.The drug has now been pulled from the UK's Recovery trial, which is run by the University of Oxford.The findings have been passed on to the World Health Organization.Back at the start of the pandemic, laboratory studies had suggested the malaria drug could affect the virus. Small-scale studies in China and France then hinted it might help patients.There was a huge amount of hope, as the medicine is cheap and has been safely used to treat malaria and conditions such as lupus and arthritis.However, the evidence supporting its use for coronavirus has been weak.That is why the data from the Recovery trial is crucial. It is the first to test the drug in large numbers of people in a thorough clinical trial.More than 11,000 patients with Covid-19 are taking part, with 1,542 patients given hydroxychloroquine. Due to mounting controversy about the drug, the UK's drugs regulator last night asked the Oxford researchers to review their data. The results showed 25.7% of people taking hydroxychloroquine had died after 28 days. This compared with 23.5% who were given standard hospital treatment. ""This is not a treatment for Covid,"" said Prof Martin Landray, part of the Recovery trial. The trial immediately stopped using the drug. The findings come in the wake of deep concern in academic publishing that led to an article being retracted in the Lancet - one of the world's most prestigious medical journals.It had published a study involving nearly 15,000 patients, from hundreds of hospitals, given hydroxycholoroquine or the similar drug chloroquine. It concluded the drug was not beneficial and increased the risk of irregular heart rhythms and death. That publication led to the WHO suspending its trials of the anti-malaria drug.The data had been collected from hospitals by the little-known healthcare firm Surgisphere. Concerns were raised about the data and then some of the study's authors said they could no longer stand by their publication as Surgisphere would not allow an independent review.Then the New England Journal of Medicine retracted another paper that had data based on Surgisphere. Prof Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford which runs the Recovery trial, said: ""Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have received a lot of attention and have been used very widely to treat Covid patients despite the absence of any good evidence. ""Although it is disappointing that this treatment has been shown to be ineffective, it does allow us to focus care and research on more promising drugs.""Follow James on Twitter.",5 June 2020,health
Vaccine summit exceeds target to raise almost £7bn,"Almost £7bn has been raised to immunise 300 million children at a virtual global vaccine summit hosted by the UK.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said up to eight million lives would be saved as a result of the funds pledged at the Gavi vaccine summit on Thursday.The money will help immunise children against diseases like polio, diphtheria and measles over five years.Mr Johnson said the triumph of humanity over disease was the ""greatest shared endeavour of our lifetimes"".The summit raised funds for Gavi, a global alliance of public and private sector organisations promoting vaccination among the world's poorest communities.Pledges by more than 50 countries and individuals like billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates saw the total surpass an initial target of $7.4bn (almost £6bn).Mr Gates donated $1.6bn (£1.3bn) from his foundation and Mr Johnson pledged £1.65bn over the next five years, making the UK the organisation's biggest donor.The summit comes as the world continues to struggle to get to grips with the coronavirus pandemic.Mr Johnson also used the conference to urge world leaders to renew their ""collective resolve"" to find a Covid-19 vaccine.""Just as we have great military alliances like Nato... where countries collaborate on building their collective military defence, so we now need that same spirit of collaboration and collective defence against the common enemy of disease,"" he said.""It will require a new international effort to co-operate on the surveillance and the sharing of information - data is king - that can underpin a global alert system, so we can rapidly identify any future outbreak. And it will mean a radical scaling-up of our global capacity to respond.""International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan later said she believed the UK was capable of delivering a coronavirus vaccine to those who need it ""at speed"" when one becomes available.By Tulip Mazumdar, global health correspondentUS President Donald Trump made a surprise appearance at the virtual global vaccine summit.Last week, Mr Trump severed ties with the UN's health agency, the World Health Organization, stopping around $400m (£317m) in support, after accusing it and China of mishandling the outbreak.There was international criticism of the decision, particularly because it was made in the middle of a global pandemic.But at the summit, Mr Trump struck a different tone in what was a very brief and seemingly very off-the-cuff, pre-recorded message.""As the coronavirus has shown, there are no borders, it doesn't discriminate,"" he said.""It's mean, it's nasty but we're going to take care of it together....

Coronavirus: What is the k number and can superspreading be stopped?,"As the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus, scientists have another target in their sights - the superspreading event, when one person infects many others. And there is a new number that's key to understanding why that happens. During the pandemic, there has been a focus on the reproduction or R number. This is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average.However, not every person with coronavirus passes it on to the same number of people. Some may self-isolate and infect nobody, while others go about their life and infect many people.This is where the k number is useful. It measures the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects. The smaller the k number is, the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is. This means more superspreaders, each individually infecting higher numbers of people.About 10-15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections, according to an expert.Dr Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), says: ""Typically, what happens is a lot of people don't give the infection to anyone. ""And then there's a handful of events where you see large amounts of transmission happening with five, 10, 20 people potentially infected. And we saw that even quite early on with Covid.""Covid-19 is passed on through people shedding virus particles from their bodies.How infectious someone is depends on many factors that differ dramatically from person to person, including:But it is what they do when they are at their most infectious that really drives superspreading events.""If someone, when they're most transmissible, happens to go to an all-day meeting with a large number of people, and then go out for dinner afterwards, you may well see a superspreading event,"" Dr Kucharski says.""If that person happened to have an evening at home, it might not have generated any transmission.""Scientists have been keeping track of clusters of Covid-19 since the pandemic began.Dr Gwen Knight, from LSHTM, says: ""We found that many of the settings are what we expected. ""So care settings - hospitals and care homes - unfortunately, are coming up. ""And also cruise ships, which is something we know from other infectious diseases.""But she also found clusters repeatedly appearing in other places - meat-processing plants, choirs, bars and gyms.All of these involve being indoors, in close contact with others, for prolonged periods of time.But Dr Knight says there is another common thread.""These settings are likely to be loud settings, and obviously, that has an impact on the kind of breathing you do,"" she says. ""There is the hypothesis that because it's loud, and you're expelling more or faster air, it could be this that makes the setting more and more risky.""There were several clusters linked to fitness classes in South Korea, and more were linked to Zumba classes than to pilates classes. ""So it might be that you're engaged in an exercise that requires you to breathe more heavily and deeper, as opposed to a more gentle breathing, for example.""Dr Muge Cevik, of the University of St Andrews, says: ""Not all activities, not all environments have the same risk of infection.""So, for example, the risk of infection would be higher indoors compared to outdoors.""Outdoors, generally people worry about cyclists or runners passing by - but that would be lower risk. We could say the transmission risk is negligible.""Whereas if you spend a whole day together, in a big group in a park, and if you exchange lots of food and you have really close contact, less than 2m (6ft), the risk is lower than being indoors - but there is still risk.""Hand-washing, social distancing and not sharing utensils is essential, she says.Strict lockdowns were a blunt tool for halting the spread of coronavirus.But as infections decrease, and the world opens up, scientists say a more targeted approach is needed,Dr Cevik says: ""We need to understand the transmission dynamics so we can concentrate our contact-tracing focus. ""But if we can avoid these superspreading events, and the environments and activities associated with them, you can decrease almost 80% of infections. ""And that's huge.""

Coronavirus: Lockdowns in Europe saved millions of lives,"Lockdowns have saved more than three million lives from coronavirus in Europe, a study estimates.The team at Imperial College London said the ""death toll would have been huge"" without lockdown. But they warned that only a small proportion of people had been infected and we were still only ""at the beginning of the pandemic"".Another study argued global lockdowns had ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".The Imperial study assessed the impact of restrictions in 11 European countries - Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK - up to the beginning of May.By that time, around 130,000 people had died from coronavirus in those countries.The researchers used disease modelling to predict how many deaths there would have been if lockdown had not happened. And the work comes from the same group that guided the UK's decision to go into lockdown.They estimated 3.2 million people would have died by 4 May if not for measures such as closing businesses and telling people to stay at home.That meant lockdown saved around 3.1 million lives, including 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France and 630,000 in Italy, the report in the journal Nature shows. ""Lockdown averted millions of deaths, those deaths would have been a tragedy,"" said Dr Seth Flaxman, from Imperial.Their equations made several assumptions, which will affect the figures. They assume nobody would have changed their behaviour in response to the Covid threat without a lockdown - and that hospitals would not be overwhelmed resulting in a surge in deaths, which nearly happened in some countries. The study also does not take into account the health consequences of lockdowns that may take years to fully uncover. The model also predicted that the outbreak would be nearly over by now without lockdown, as so many people would have been infected.More than seven in 10 people in the UK would have had Covid, leading to herd immunity and the virus no longer spreading. Instead, the researchers estimate that up to 15 million people across Europe had been infected by the beginning of May.The researchers say at most, 4% of the population in those countries had been infected. ""Claims this is all over can be firmly rejected. We are only at the beginning of this pandemic,"" said Dr Flaxman.And it means that as lockdowns start to lift, there is the risk the virus could start to spread again.""There is a very real risk if mobility goes back up there could be a second wave coming reasonably soon, in the next month or two,"" said Dr Samir Bhatt.Meanwhile, a separate study by University of California, Berkeley, analysed the impact of lockdowns in China, South Korea, Iran, France and the US.Their report, also in Nature, says lockdown prevented 530 million infections in those countries. Just before lockdowns were introduced, they said cases were doubling every two days. Dr Solomon Hsiang, one of the researchers, said coronavirus had been a ""real human tragedy"" but the global action to stop the spread of the virus had ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".Follow James on Twitter",8 June 2020,health
