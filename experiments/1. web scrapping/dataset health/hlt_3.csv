Coronavirus: Children affected by rare Kawasaki-like disease,"Scores of UK and US children have been affected by a rare inflammatory disease linked to coronavirus.In a tiny number of children it can cause serious complications, with some needing intensive care.Up to 100 children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in children elsewhere in Europe.It is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease.In April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children.This was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London, including a 14-year-old who died.They all had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain.Most of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues.Doctors are describing it as a ""new phenomenon"" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips.But this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications.Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked.""You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon,"" she said.This means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home.The syndrome is ""exceptionally rare"", he said.""This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown,"" Prof Viner added.He said understanding more about the inflammatory disease ""might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic"".Children are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital.Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies.""So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus,"" he said.However Prof Levin said there was ""a vast amount to learn"" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks.Children appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases.There have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands.At least 15 US states are looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo.Out of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week.Meanwhile, according to a study by doctors in northern Italy, 10 children have been affected by the disease.All 10 of the children in the study were admitted to a hospital in Bergamo - the city at the centre of the worst outbreak in Italy - between mid-February and mid-April, and recovered.The children, who had an average age of seven, tended to have severe symptoms such as heart complications and signs of toxic shock syndrome. They also needed additional treatment with steroids.In antibody tests on the children, eight appeared to have already had the coronavirus while the other two had not. But the researchers said the tests were not 100% accurate. Swab tests to detect the virus are not thought to be useful because the reaction tends to occur many weeks after infection.Dr Lucio Verdoni, report author and doctor at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, said: ""Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children.""Child health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children.They are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).

Coronavirus: A third of hospital patients develop dangerous blood clots,"Up to 30% of patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus are developing dangerous blood clots, according to medical experts.They say the clots, also known as thrombosis, could be contributing to the number of people dying.Severe inflammation in the lungs - a natural response of the body to the virus - is behind their formation.Patients worldwide are being affected by many medical complications of the virus, some of which can be fatal.Back in March, as coronavirus was spreading across the globe, doctors started seeing far higher rates of clots in patients admitted to hospital than they would normally expect.And there have been other surprises, including the discovery of hundreds of micro-clots in the lungs of some patients.The virus has also increased cases of deep vein thrombosis - blood clots usually found in the leg - which can be life-threatening when fragments break off and move up the body into the lungs, blocking blood vessels.Artist Brian McClure was rushed to hospital last month suffering from the pneumonia brought on by coronavirus. But soon after he arrived, he had a scan showing he was in a bigger fight for his life. ""I went for a lung screening and that showed blood clots in the lungs. I was told that was very dangerous,"" he said. ""That was when I really started to get worried. I got the picture that if I didn't improve then I would be in serious trouble.""He is now continuing his recovery at home.""With a huge outpouring of data over the past few weeks I think it has become apparent that thrombosis is a major problem,"" says Roopen Arya, professor of thrombosis and haemostasis at King's College Hospital, London.""Particularly in severely affected Covid patients in critical care, where some of the more recent studies show that nearly half the patients have pulmonary embolism or blood clot on the lungs.""He believes the number of critically ill coronavirus patients developing blood clots could be significantly higher than the published data in Europe of up to 30%.The professor's blood sciences team in the hospital has been analysing samples from patients showing how coronavirus is changing their blood making it much more sticky. And sticky blood can lead to blood clots.This change in the blood is the result of severe inflammation in the lungs, a natural response of the body to the virus. ""In severely affected patients we are seeing an outpouring of chemicals in the blood and this has a knock-on effect of activating the blood clotting,"" says Prof Arya.And all this ultimately causes a patient's condition to deteriorate.According to thrombosis expert Prof Beverley Hunt, sticky blood is having wider repercussions than just blood clots - it's also leading to higher rates of strokes and heart attacks.""And yes sticky blood is contributing to high mortality rates,"" she says.To add to all these medical challenges, there are studies showing that the blood thinners currently being used to treat the blood clots are not always working. And ramping up doses to much higher levels risks patients suffering major bleeding which can be fatal.The balance between treating the thrombosis and causing bleeds is ""a precarious one"", according to Prof Arya.But there is now a big push to get medical teams from around the world to co-operate in finding the safest and most effective way of tackling the blood clot problem thrown up by the virus.Trials are under way to find a standard dosage of blood thinners to be used in all countries.However, some experts believe there could be another solution: finding a way to reduce the acute inflammation in the lungs which leads to the creation of sticky blood, the source of the problem.",16 May 2020,health
Coronavirus infection 'R' rate in UK creeps up,"The infection rate in the UK has gone up and is close to the point where the virus starts spreading rapidly, government scientific advice says. The so-called ""R-number"" is now between 0.7 and 1.0 - it needs to be kept below one in order to stay in control. The rise in the figures is thought to be driven by the virus spreading in care homes and hospitals.The effect of the changes to lockdown announced by the prime minister on Sunday is still unknown.R is the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to, on average. If it is 2 then 10 infected people would pass it onto 20 others. But if is 0.5 then 10 infected people pass it onto 5 others. The R-number had been sitting between 0.5 and 0.9. Any increase limits the ability of politicians to lift lockdown measures.Health secretary Matt Hancock said the R-number was an ""incredibly important figure"" and it was important to note ""we don't think that it is above one"".The number of new cases is still falling in the UK, but not as quickly as in the past. Sources said that progress was ""getting closer to flat"".This could cause problems as low numbers of cases are needed to make it easier to perform mass testing and find the people anyone carrying the virus have come into contact with. The latest analysis takes account of the spread of coronavirus in care homes, hospitals and more widely in society. As the figures are based on patients ending up in hospital, they actually give a sense of the R-number from around three weeks ago. That predates Boris Johnson's shift in England from ""stay at home"" to ""stay alert"", alongside encouraging some people back to work and allowing people to meet one person from outside their household outdoors. The increase in the infection rate is said to be ""consistent with"" a significant fall in cases in the community and the epidemic and in turn the R-number being driven by care homes. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government chief scientific adviser said: ""To keep R below one and control the virus, it is vital that people stay alert and continue to follow the latest government guidelines to the letter.""Meanwhile, the Department of Health said it recorded another 384 deaths of people in the UK, bringing the total number to have died following a positive coronavirus test to 33,998.The big question is how the rise in the R number will affect plans to lift lockdown. If R goes above 1 then there could be a ""second peak"" in cases and this is what politicians are trying to avoid.The rise could mean the government has less wiggle room to lift restrictions and we'll have to live with them for longer. But it is important to understand why the infection rate has increased.One explanation is a large drop in cases in the general public means the R-number is reflecting what is happening in care homes in hospitals.That could mean there is still capacity to lift parts of lockdown in most parts of society. Coronavirus disease modelling, published by the University of Cambridge, has also given a picture of how different regions of England are coping.The figures do not perfectly match those from the SAGE group of government scientific advisors because it assesses multiple models to reach its conclusions.The Cambridge study, backed by Public Health England, shows London has made the most progress with suppressing the virus, while it is proving far more stubborn in the north-east of England.Those figures are more optimistic than other groups' calculations. The Cambridge team calculated the figures by working backwards from the number of deaths. However, they have looked only at deaths confirmed with a genetic test rather than all deaths. Similar work by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine puts the number for London at 0.6 and the South West at 0.9. They also showed the R-values were 0.8 in Wales, and 1 in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, claims there are now just 24 cases a day in the capital and that it could soon be free of the virus have been criticised.There were in fact 49 people admitted to London hospitals with Covid-19 yesterday and probably hundreds of cases that did not need hospital treatment.""I am extremely worried about the media message that London could be coronavirus free in days,"" said Prof Matt Keeling, from the University of Warwick.He added: ""If people think London is coronavirus-free that could be dangerous, and could lead to complacency, undermining all the struggles and sacrifices that everyone has made so far.  A relaxation of vigilance could easily see R increasing above 1, and a second epidemic wave.""Follow James on Twitter",15 May 2020,health
