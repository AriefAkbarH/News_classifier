Coronavirus: Immune clue sparks treatment hope,"UK scientists are to begin testing a treatment that it is hoped could counter the effects of Covid-19 in the most seriously ill patients.It has been found those with the most severe form of the disease have extremely low numbers of an immune cell called a T-cell. T-cells clear infection from the body.The clinical trial will evaluate if a drug called interleukin 7, known to boost T-cell numbers, can aid patients' recovery.It involves scientists from the Francis Crick Institute, King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.They have looked at immune cells in the blood of 60 Covid-19 patients and found an apparent crash in the numbers of T-cells. Prof Adrian Hayday from the Crick Institute said it was a ""great surprise"" to see what was happening with the immune cells.""They're trying to protect us, but the virus seems to be doing something that's pulling the rug from under them, because their numbers have declined dramatically.In a microlitre (0.001ml) drop of blood, normal healthy adults have between 2,000 and 4,000 T-cells, also called T lymphocytes. The Covid patients the team tested had between 200-1,200. The researchers say these findings pave the way for them to develop a ""fingerprint test"" to check the levels of T-cells in the blood which could provide early indications of who might go on to develop more severe disease. But it also provides the possibility for a specific treatment to reverse that immune cell decline.  Manu Shankar-Hari, a critical care consultant at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, said that around 70% of patients that he sees in intensive care with Covid-19 arrive with between 400-800 lymphocytes per microlitre. ""When they start to recover, their lymphocyte level also starts to go back up,"" he added. Interleukin 7 has already been tested in a small group of patients with sepsis and proved to safely increase the production of these specific cells. In this trial, it will be given to patients with a low lymphocyte count who have been in critical care for more than three days.Mr Shankar-Hari said: ""We are hoping that [when we increase the cell count] the viral infections gets cleared.""As a critical care physician, I look after patients who are extremely unwell and, other than supportive care, we do not have any direct active treatment against the disease. ""So a treatment like this coming along for in the context of a clinical trial is extremely encouraging for critical care physicians across the UK.""This research has also provided insight into the specific ways in which this disease interacts with the immune system, which Prof Hayday says will be vital as scientists around the world look for clinically valuable information. ""The virus that has caused this completely Earth-changing emergency is unique - it's  different. It is something unprecedented."" ""The exact reason for this disruption - the  spanner in the works of the T-cell system - is not at all clear to us.""This virus is really doing something distinct and future research - which we will start immediately - needs to find out the mechanism by which this virus is having these effects.""",22 May 2020,health

Coronavirus: Children and older adults to take part in vaccine trial,"Children and older adults are to be included in the second phase of vaccine trials to protect against coronavirus.The first phase of the University of Oxford trial began in April, involving 1,000 healthy adults aged 55 and under.Now more than 10,200 people - including over 70s and five to 12-year-olds - will be enrolled in the study, to see the effects on their immune system.Trials of the same vaccine on monkeys appear to have given them some protection against the disease.The animals had less of the virus in their lungs and airways, but it is not certain this finding will translate to people.The scientists behind the vaccine have previously said they are aiming to have at least a million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by September this year.But the UK government has repeatedly said there are no guarantees - and a vaccine could still be some way off.And most experts still estimate it will take 12 to 18 months to develop and manufacture a vaccine.There are more than 100 experimental vaccines against Covid-10 currently being developed worldwide.Adults in this trial will receive one or two doses of either the new vaccine - ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 - or another licensed vaccine.Researchers will then compare the number of infections in both groups. This could take between two and to six months, depending on how many people are exposed to the virus.The age range of participants has been expanded to include those aged:Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology, at the Jenner Institute, said: ""We have had a lot of interest already from people over the age of 55 years who were not eligible to take part in the phase-one study.""And we will now be able to include older age groups to continue the vaccine assessment.

Coronavirus: Hydroxychloroquine trial begins in the UK,"A trial to see whether two anti-malarial drugs could prevent Covid-19 has begun in Brighton and Oxford.Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or a placebo will be given to more than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.All the participants are staff who are in contact with Covid-19 patients.US President Donald Trump was criticised this week after he said he had been taking hydroxychloroquine, despite warnings it might be unsafe.The first UK participants in the global trial are being enrolled on Thursday at the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals and the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.  They will be given either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo for three months. At sites in Asia, participants will be given chloroquine or a placebo.These are the first of a planned 25 UK sites, with results expected by the end of the year. The trial is open to anyone delivering direct care to coronavirus patients in the UK, as long as they have not been diagnosed with Covid-19. It will test whether the drugs can prevent healthcare workers exposed to the virus from contracting it. One of the study's leaders, Prof Nicholas White at the University of Oxford said: ""We really do not know if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are beneficial or harmful against Covid-19.""But, he said, a randomised controlled trial such as this one, where neither the participant nor the researchers know who has been given the drug or a placebo, was the best way to find out. ""A widely available, safe and effective vaccine may be a long way off,"" said Prof Martin Llewelyn from Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who is also leading the study.  ""If drugs as well-tolerated as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could reduce the chances of catching Covid-19, this would be incredibly valuable."" The drugs can reduce fever and inflammation and are used as both a prevention and a treatment for malaria. Hydroxychloroquine regulates the body's immune response and is also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Lupus - an inflammatory disease caused by an overactive immune system. Lupus charities in the UK and US have raised concerns that demand for the drug associated with coronavirus could threaten the supply for patients who already rely on it. The drug gained attention after US President Donald Trump suggested it may be beneficial, and this week said he was taking hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus.The US Food and Drug Administration warned against use of the medication outside hospitals, where the agency has granted temporary authorisation for its use in some cases, or clinical trials.While the University of Oxford trial is taking place in a controlled clinical environment, the World Health Organization has warned that some individuals were self-medicating and risked causing themselves serious harm.It has not yet been shown to be safe and effective in the prevention or treatment of coronavirus and can cause dangerous heart arrhythmias. The trial also involves researchers from the UK, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Italy. ",21 May 2020,health

Coronavirus: What tests are being done in the UK?,"Everyone aged five and over in the UK with coronavirus symptoms can now be tested for the disease, Heath Secretary Matt Hancock has announced.So what exactly is the government's testing strategy? Making tests available to anyone over five with symptoms is a major expansion of the UK's testing programme.When testing started, it was only for the sickest patients in hospitals, but eligibility gradually grew. If you think you need a coronavirus test you can arrange to visit a regional test site. Alternatively, you can ask for a home test kit - although these have been in short supply. The test is performed by a taking a swab up the nose or from the back of the throat.At first the British Medical Association said accessing centres was a major problem, with some people having to drive hundreds of miles to their nearest site. New testing centres have since been opened, although people must still have access to a car and someone to drive them - or be well enough to drive themselves. The army was also enlisted to provide pop-up testing facilities in sparsely-populated areas far away from any of the main sites. However, concerns have been raised about long waits for some test results.Mr Hancock also announced that the government was trialling a new much quicker swab test which doesn't need to be sent to a lab, and gives results in 20 minutes. The new swab tests will be trialled in Hampshire in some A&E departments, GP testing hubs and care homes. The trial will run for six weeks and test up to 4,000 people.If successful, he said the new test will be rolled out on a larger scale ""as soon as we can"".The government set a target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day across the UK by the end of April, and managed to log 122,347 tests on 30 April.But it was criticised for including in this figure about 40,000 testing kits which are counted when they are sent out.The target was also met on 1 May. It was missed for eight consecutive days after that before being met again on 10 May. On 20 May, 128,340 tests were provided. Now the government is working towards a fresh target to get to 200,000 tests a day by the end of May, but this figure seems to refer to testing ""capacity"", not the actual number of tests carried out.  The swab test only tells you if you currently have Covid-19. However, health officials in England have approved a test that will show if someone has had coronavirus in the past.The new test - from Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche - looks for antibodies in the blood to see if a person has had the virus and might now have some form of immunity. On 21 May, Mr Hancock said 10 million tests had been ordered through Roche and pharmaceutical company Abbott.He said it would be available to health and social care staff, patients and care home residents from next week. There is an antibody test already in use at government research facility Porton Down, to make early estimates about what percentage of the population might have had the virus. But it is not accurate enough to give individuals information about their infection status.There are also questions over how long immunity lasts. There is no evidence people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from being infected again, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.People are tested to diagnose them individually, but it can also be used to understand how far the virus has spread in the population.Tests help people, including NHS workers, know whether they are safe to go to work. Wide testing can also let the health service plan for extra demand, and inform government decisions around social distancing and lockdowns.For this reason, an initial 20,000 households in England will be tested every month for a year - for active coronavirus infections and for antibodies indicating a past infection.The UK significantly increased its testing capacity throughout April, but lagged behind many other nations. Germany, for example, was regularly averaging 100,000 tests a day, by the start of last month. The UK did not start with the resources to do mass testing, unlike some other countries. But it also took several weeks to expand from an initial eight public health laboratories to a wider network of private and university labs.Follow Rachel on TwitterHave you been tested?
