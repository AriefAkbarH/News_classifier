Coronavirus: Blood clots targeted in treatment trial,"Scientists are to test whether an experimental drug can prevent potentially deadly blood clots associated with Covid-19.The trial, funded by the British Heart Foundation, will test the theory the clots are caused by a hormone imbalance triggered by coronavirus infection.It will become one of several drugs currently being trialled to prevent the disease's worst effects.  A third of hospitalised coronavirus patients develop dangerous blood clots. The drug, TRV027, works to rebalance hormones involved in blood pressure, water and salt. Scientists from Imperial College London, involved in the trial, think that when the virus enters the body, it uses an enzyme as a ""handle"" to enter the cells. But this disables the enzyme, which plays an important role in balancing the key hormones. When out of balance, the blood can become sticky, leading to clots.They theorise that TRV027 - which won its creator a Nobel Prize in 2012 - can step in to play this rebalancing role.Many of the treatments being trialled to treat Covid-19 focus on the body's inflammatory response. But the hormonal imbalance is a ""quite distinct problem"" which may provide clues to the question of why some people get severely ill why others do not, says Dr David Owen, one of the study's leads.Blood clotting could also explain why Covid-19 seems to particularly affect people who already have cardiovascular disease despite being a respiratory illness, according to the British Heart Foundation.Since Covid-19 is such a complex disease which effects many of the body's systems, this treatment could be used in combination with other drugs says Dr Kat Pollock, a joint lead on the study. About 60 patients will be given either the new experimental drug, or a placebo, starting next month. It has been shown to be safe in patients with acute heart failure, although it was not effective as a treatment for this condition.  TRV027 is just one of several different drugs being trialled to ease the disease's worst effects or help the body fight it off. At least 10 different antiviral drugs including HIV treatment lopinavir/ritonavir are being, or have been trialled to see if they can help fight off the disease.None has yet been shown to be effective on its own, although there is still hope several could be used together to shorten patients' illnesses. Remdesivir, a drug that has shown promising effects, works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs in order to replicate inside body cells.Meanwhile plasma - the liquid part of blood - taken from people who have recovered from coronavirus might also help, by giving sick people who haven't recovered the right antibodies to fight it off. And a number of other treatments are focusing on the body's dangerous inflammatory response to fighting Covid-19, known as cytokine release syndrome.

Coronavirus social-contact curbs 'put adolescents at risk',"Reduced face-to-face contact among teenagers and their friends during the pandemic could have damaging long-term consequences, neuroscientists say.At a sensitive time in life, their brain development, behaviour and mental health could suffer.Using social media might make up for some negative effects of social distancing, they write in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health.But they call for schools to reopen for young people as a priority when safe.Adolescence - defined by the scientists as between 10 and 24 - is a vulnerable stage, when young people want to spend more time with their friends than their family, as they prepare for adult life.Combined with major hormonal and biological changes, it's a key time for the development of the brain.It's also the period in life when mental-health problems are mostly likely to develop.But the arrival of coronavirus has disrupted all that, says Prof Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, from the department of psychology at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the opinion piece.""Owing to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, many young people around the world currently have substantially fewer opportunities to interact face-to-face with peers in their social network at a time in their lives when this is crucial for their development,"" she says.""Even if physical distancing measures are temporary, several months represents a large proportion of a young person's life.""We would urge policymakers to give urgent consideration to the well-being of young people at this time."" The Viewpoint article, written with Amy Orben, research fellow at Cambridge, and Livia Tomova, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls for more research to be carried out to understand the effects of ""social deprivation"" on adolescents.At present, research on animals is all they have to go on - and it suggests that non-human primates and rodents experience a rise in anxious behaviour and a decrease in brain functions related to learning and memory when social contact is taken away.This is likely to be due to the lack of experiences for social learning, they say.But with 69% of younger adolescents in the UK, aged 12-15, having a social-media profile, social connection is still possible - via anything from Instagram to online gaming.The question is how much and what kinds of digital communication help to lessen the effects of physical distancing, says Dr Orben.""Some studies have shown that active social-media use, such as messaging or posting directly on another person's profile, increases well-being and helps maintain personal relationships. ""However, it has been suggested that passive uses of social media, such as scrolling through newsfeeds, negatively influence wellbeing.""Lockdown rules brought in to stop the spread of the virus have meant schools in the UK have been closed to most children since 20 March.A small number of primary school children have returned in England, but only in small groups.",13 June 2020,health
"Coronavirus came to UK 'on at least 1,300 separate occasions'","Coronavirus was brought into the UK on at least 1,300 separate occasions, a major analysis of the genetics of the virus shows.The study, by the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium (Cog-UK), completely quashes the idea that a single ""patient zero"" started the whole UK outbreak.The analysis also finds China, where the pandemic started, had a negligible impact on cases in the UK.Instead those initial cases came mostly from European countries. The researchers analysed the genetic code of viral samples taken from more than 20,000 people infected with coronavirus in the UK.Then, like a gigantic version of a paternity test, the geneticists attempted to piece together the virus's massive family tree. This was combined with data on international travel to get to the origins of the UK epidemic. They found the UK's coronavirus epidemic did not have one origin - but at least 1,356 origins. On each of those occasions somebody brought the infection into the UK from abroad and the virus began to spread as a result. ""The surprising and exciting conclusion is that we found the UK epidemic has resulted from a very large number of separate importations,"" said Prof Nick Loman, from Cog-UK and the University of Birmingham.""It wasn't a patient zero,"" he added.The study showed that less than 0.1% of those imported cases came directly from China. Instead the UK's coronavirus epidemic was largely initiated by travel from Italy in late February, Spain in early-to-mid-March and then France in mid-to-late-March.""The big surprise for us was how fluid the process was, the rate of and source of virus introduction shifted rapidly over the course of only a few weeks,"" said Prof Oliver Pybus, from the University of Oxford.80% occurred from 28 Feb-29 Mar ""This happened later than perhaps we would have expected,"" added Prof Loman.The study estimates 80% of those initial cases arrived in the country between 28 Feb and 29 March - the time the UK was debating whether to lockdown.After this point, the number of new imported cases diminished rapidly.The earliest one could be traced back to the beginning of February, but it is possible there were cases even earlier that could not be picked up by the analysis.The study also says the controversial football match between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid, on 11 March, probably had very little impact on bringing the virus into the country.An estimated 3,000 fans flew in from Spain to watch the game, but there were 20,000 people flying in from Spain every single day in mid-March.""[It] shows that individual events such as football matches likely made a negligible contribution to the number of imports at that time,"" the study says.The imported cases each started off a chain of transmission where the virus is passed from one person, to the next, to the next and so on.However, the study shows lockdown has massively disrupted the spread of the virus.""If there's good news here, these chains of transmission were and are being suppressed and going extinct as a result of social distancing and we continue to see that now,"" Prof Loman said.Follow James on Twitter",10 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: Asymptomatic transmission still an 'open question',"How much coronavirus transmission comes from people with no symptoms is still a ""big unknown"", a World Health Organization scientist has clarified.Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said on Monday it was ""very rare"" for asymptomatic people to pass the disease on.But she has now stressed this observation was based on a relatively small set of studies.Evidence suggests people with symptoms are most infectious, but the disease can be passed on before they develop. Although a proportion of people test positive with no symptoms, it is not known how many of these people go on to infect others.Dr Van Kerkhove said the evidence she had been discussing came from countries that had carried out ""detailed contact tracing"", Looking at investigations of clusters of infections from various countries, she said that where an asymptomatic case had been followed up it was ""very rare"" to find secondary infections among their contacts.But she it was still a ""big open question"" as to whether the same was true globally.The uncertainties involved emphasise the importance of lockdown measures in ""massively reduc[ing] the numbers of people infected,"" said Prof Liam Smeeth, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He said he had been ""surprised"" by the WHO statement but had not seen the data it was based on.Director of the WHO's health emergencies programme, Dr Michael Ryan, said he was ""absolutely convinced"" asymptomatic transmission was occurring, ""the question is how much"".  Dr Van Kerkhove, the WHO's head of emerging diseases, made the distinction between three categories:Some reports distinguish between these categories while others do not and she said this, along with the relatively small groups of people studied, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions. But Dr Van Kerkhove said the weight of evidence suggested people who never develop symptoms did not play a significant role in passing on the virus in the locations studied.Studies which tested samples of the population to find asymptomatic cases, and then traced their contacts, found far fewer secondary infections than in the contacts of people who'd had symptoms. This led the WHO, in guidance on wearing masks published at the weekend, to conclude: ""The available evidence from contact tracing reported by member states suggests that asymptomatically-infected individuals are much less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms""In England, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been regularly testing a sample of the population.It has found that, of those who have so far tested positive for Covid-19, only 29% reported ""any evidence of symptoms"" at the time they were tested, or at the previous or following visits.Contact-tracing studies from a number of countries suggest that while ""true"" asymptomatic cases ""rarely transmit"" infection, transmission can occur before or on the day symptoms first appear when they may be very mild, according to Prof Babak Javid, an infectious diseases consultant at the University of Cambridge.People can have detectable amounts of the virus in their system roughly three days before developing symptoms and appear to be capable to passing it on during this period, especially the day before or on the day symptoms begin. Pre-symptomatic transmission has ""important implications"" for track, trace and isolation measures, Prof Javid said. Under the terms of the contact-tracing schemes now operational across the UK, someone who passed on the infection while pre-symptomatic could still have their contacts traced once they developed symptoms. Someone who never experienced symptoms wouldn't trigger the same process. While people without symptoms do seem to be capable of infecting others, current evidence still suggests people with symptoms are the highest risk. A positive result alone doesn't tell you how much of the virus someone has in their system. And this - what is known as the viral load - along with whether an infected person is sneezing and coughing and what kind of contact they are having with other people, influences how likely they are to pass the illness on.Dr Van Kerkhove pointed out since coronavirus mainly ""passes through infectious droplets"", it is when people are coughing or sneezing that they are most able to transmit the disease.

Coronavirus: Lockdowns in Europe saved millions of lives,"Lockdowns have saved more than three million lives from coronavirus in Europe, a study estimates.The team at Imperial College London said the ""death toll would have been huge"" without lockdown. But they warned that only a small proportion of people had been infected and we were still only ""at the beginning of the pandemic"".Another study argued global lockdowns had ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".The Imperial study assessed the impact of restrictions in 11 European countries - Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK - up to the beginning of May.By that time, around 130,000 people had died from coronavirus in those countries.The researchers used disease modelling to predict how many deaths there would have been if lockdown had not happened. And the work comes from the same group that guided the UK's decision to go into lockdown.They estimated 3.2 million people would have died by 4 May if not for measures such as closing businesses and telling people to stay at home.That meant lockdown saved around 3.1 million lives, including 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France and 630,000 in Italy, the report in the journal Nature shows. ""Lockdown averted millions of deaths, those deaths would have been a tragedy,"" said Dr Seth Flaxman, from Imperial.Their equations made several assumptions, which will affect the figures. They assume nobody would have changed their behaviour in response to the Covid threat without a lockdown - and that hospitals would not be overwhelmed resulting in a surge in deaths, which nearly happened in some countries. The study also does not take into account the health consequences of lockdowns that may take years to fully uncover. The model also predicted that the outbreak would be nearly over by now without lockdown, as so many people would have been infected.More than seven in 10 people in the UK would have had Covid, leading to herd immunity and the virus no longer spreading. Instead, the researchers estimate that up to 15 million people across Europe had been infected by the beginning of May.The researchers say at most, 4% of the population in those countries had been infected. ""Claims this is all over can be firmly rejected. We are only at the beginning of this pandemic,"" said Dr Flaxman.And it means that as lockdowns start to lift, there is the risk the virus could start to spread again.""There is a very real risk if mobility goes back up there could be a second wave coming reasonably soon, in the next month or two,"" said Dr Samir Bhatt.Meanwhile, a separate study by University of California, Berkeley, analysed the impact of lockdowns in China, South Korea, Iran, France and the US.Their report, also in Nature, says lockdown prevented 530 million infections in those countries. Just before lockdowns were introduced, they said cases were doubling every two days. Dr Solomon Hsiang, one of the researchers, said coronavirus had been a ""real human tragedy"" but the global action to stop the spread of the virus had ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".Follow James on Twitter",8 June 2020,health

Coronavirus social-contact curbs 'put adolescents at risk',"Reduced face-to-face contact among teenagers and their friends during the pandemic could have damaging long-term consequences, neuroscientists say.At a sensitive time in life, their brain development, behaviour and mental health could suffer.Using social media might make up for some negative effects of social distancing, they write in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health.But they call for schools to reopen for young people as a priority when safe.Adolescence - defined by the scientists as between 10 and 24 - is a vulnerable stage, when young people want to spend more time with their friends than their family, as they prepare for adult life.Combined with major hormonal and biological changes, it's a key time for the development of the brain.It's also the period in life when mental-health problems are mostly likely to develop.But the arrival of coronavirus has disrupted all that, says Prof Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, from the department of psychology at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the opinion piece.""Owing to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, many young people around the world currently have substantially fewer opportunities to interact face-to-face with peers in their social network at a time in their lives when this is crucial for their development,"" she says.""Even if physical distancing measures are temporary, several months represents a large proportion of a young person's life.""We would urge policymakers to give urgent consideration to the well-being of young people at this time."" The Viewpoint article, written with Amy Orben, research fellow at Cambridge, and Livia Tomova, from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls for more research to be carried out to understand the effects of ""social deprivation"" on adolescents.At present, research on animals is all they have to go on - and it suggests that non-human primates and rodents experience a rise in anxious behaviour and a decrease in brain functions related to learning and memory when social contact is taken away.This is likely to be due to the lack of experiences for social learning, they say.But with 69% of younger adolescents in the UK, aged 12-15, having a social-media profile, social connection is still possible - via anything from Instagram to online gaming.The question is how much and what kinds of digital communication help to lessen the effects of physical distancing, says Dr Orben.""Some studies have shown that active social-media use, such as messaging or posting directly on another person's profile, increases well-being and helps maintain personal relationships. ""However, it has been suggested that passive uses of social media, such as scrolling through newsfeeds, negatively influence wellbeing.""Lockdown rules brought in to stop the spread of the virus have meant schools in the UK have been closed to most children since 20 March.A small number of primary school children have returned in England, but only in small groups.",13 June 2020,health
"Coronavirus came to UK 'on at least 1,300 separate occasions'","Coronavirus was brought into the UK on at least 1,300 separate occasions, a major analysis of the genetics of the virus shows.The study, by the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium (Cog-UK), completely quashes the idea that a single ""patient zero"" started the whole UK outbreak.The analysis also finds China, where the pandemic started, had a negligible impact on cases in the UK.Instead those initial cases came mostly from European countries. The researchers analysed the genetic code of viral samples taken from more than 20,000 people infected with coronavirus in the UK.Then, like a gigantic version of a paternity test, the geneticists attempted to piece together the virus's massive family tree. This was combined with data on international travel to get to the origins of the UK epidemic. They found the UK's coronavirus epidemic did not have one origin - but at least 1,356 origins. On each of those occasions somebody brought the infection into the UK from abroad and the virus began to spread as a result. ""The surprising and exciting conclusion is that we found the UK epidemic has resulted from a very large number of separate importations,"" said Prof Nick Loman, from Cog-UK and the University of Birmingham.""It wasn't a patient zero,"" he added.The study showed that less than 0.1% of those imported cases came directly from China. Instead the UK's coronavirus epidemic was largely initiated by travel from Italy in late February, Spain in early-to-mid-March and then France in mid-to-late-March.""The big surprise for us was how fluid the process was, the rate of and source of virus introduction shifted rapidly over the course of only a few weeks,"" said Prof Oliver Pybus, from the University of Oxford.80% occurred from 28 Feb-29 Mar ""This happened later than perhaps we would have expected,"" added Prof Loman.The study estimates 80% of those initial cases arrived in the country between 28 Feb and 29 March - the time the UK was debating whether to lockdown.After this point, the number of new imported cases diminished rapidly.The earliest one could be traced back to the beginning of February, but it is possible there were cases even earlier that could not be picked up by the analysis.The study also says the controversial football match between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid, on 11 March, probably had very little impact on bringing the virus into the country.An estimated 3,000 fans flew in from Spain to watch the game, but there were 20,000 people flying in from Spain every single day in mid-March.""[It] shows that individual events such as football matches likely made a negligible contribution to the number of imports at that time,"" the study says.The imported cases each started off a chain of transmission where the virus is passed from one person, to the next, to the next and so on.However, the study shows lockdown has massively disrupted the spread of the virus.""If there's good news here, these chains of transmission were and are being suppressed and going extinct as a result of social distancing and we continue to see that now,"" Prof Loman said.Follow James on Twitter",10 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: Asymptomatic transmission still an 'open question',"How much coronavirus transmission comes from people with no symptoms is still a ""big unknown"", a World Health Organization scientist has clarified.Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said on Monday it was ""very rare"" for asymptomatic people to pass the disease on.But she has now stressed this observation was based on a relatively small set of studies.Evidence suggests people with symptoms are most infectious, but the disease can be passed on before they develop. Although a proportion of people test positive with no symptoms, it is not known how many of these people go on to infect others.Dr Van Kerkhove said the evidence she had been discussing came from countries that had carried out ""detailed contact tracing"", Looking at investigations of clusters of infections from various countries, she said that where an asymptomatic case had been followed up it was ""very rare"" to find secondary infections among their contacts.But she it was still a ""big open question"" as to whether the same was true globally.The uncertainties involved emphasise the importance of lockdown measures in ""massively reduc[ing] the numbers of people infected,"" said Prof Liam Smeeth, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He said he had been ""surprised"" by the WHO statement but had not seen the data it was based on.Director of the WHO's health emergencies programme, Dr Michael Ryan, said he was ""absolutely convinced"" asymptomatic transmission was occurring, ""the question is how much"".  Dr Van Kerkhove, the WHO's head of emerging diseases, made the distinction between three categories:Some reports distinguish between these categories while others do not and she said this, along with the relatively small groups of people studied, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions. But Dr Van Kerkhove said the weight of evidence suggested people who never develop symptoms did not play a significant role in passing on the virus in the locations studied.Studies which tested samples of the population to find asymptomatic cases, and then traced their contacts, found far fewer secondary infections than in the contacts of people who'd had symptoms. This led the WHO, in guidance on wearing masks published at the weekend, to conclude: ""The available evidence from contact tracing reported by member states suggests that asymptomatically-infected individuals are much less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms""In England, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been regularly testing a sample of the population.It has found that, of those who have so far tested positive for Covid-19, only 29% reported ""any evidence of symptoms"" at the time they were tested, or at the previous or following visits.Contact-tracing studies from a number of countries suggest that while ""true"" asymptomatic cases ""rarely transmit"" infection, transmission can occur before or on the day symptoms first appear when they may be very mild, according to Prof Babak Javid, an infectious diseases consultant at the University of Cambridge.People can have detectable amounts of the virus in their system roughly three days before developing symptoms and appear to be capable to passing it on during this period, especially the day before or on the day symptoms begin. Pre-symptomatic transmission has ""important implications"" for track, trace and isolation measures, Prof Javid said. Under the terms of the contact-tracing schemes now operational across the UK, someone who passed on the infection while pre-symptomatic could still have their contacts traced once they developed symptoms. Someone who never experienced symptoms wouldn't trigger the same process. While people without symptoms do seem to be capable of infecting others, current evidence still suggests people with symptoms are the highest risk. A positive result alone doesn't tell you how much of the virus someone has in their system. And this - what is known as the viral load - along with whether an infected person is sneezing and coughing and what kind of contact they are having with other people, influences how likely they are to pass the illness on.Dr Van Kerkhove pointed out since coronavirus mainly ""passes through infectious droplets"", it is when people are coughing or sneezing that they are most able to transmit the disease.

Coronavirus: Lockdowns in Europe saved millions of lives,"Lockdowns have saved more than three million lives from coronavirus in Europe, a study estimates.The team at Imperial College London said the ""death toll would have been huge"" without lockdown. But they warned that only a small proportion of people had been infected and we were still only ""at the beginning of the pandemic"".Another study argued global lockdowns had ""saved more lives, in a shorter period of time, than ever before"".The Imperial study assessed the impact of restrictions in 11 European countries - Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK - up to the beginning of May.By that time, around 130,000 people had died from coronavirus in those countries.The researchers used disease modelling to predict how many deaths there would have been if lockdown had not happened. And the work comes from the same group that guided the UK's decision to go into lockdown.They estimated 3.2 million people would have died by 4 May if not for measures such as closing businesses and telling people to stay at home.That meant lockdown saved around 3.1 million lives, including 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France and 630,000 in Italy, the report in the journal Nature shows. ""Lockdown averted millions of deaths, those deaths would have been a tragedy,"" said Dr Seth Flaxman, from Imperial.Their equations made several assumptions, which will affect the figures. They assume nobody would have changed their behaviour in response to the Covid threat without a lockdown - and that hospitals would not be overwhelmed resulting in a surge in deaths, which nearly happened in some countries. The study also does not take into account the health consequences of lockdowns that may take years to fully uncover. The model also predicted that the outbreak would be nearly over by now without lockdown, as so many people would have been infected.More than seven in 10 people in the UK would have had Covid, leading to herd immunity and the virus no longer spreading. Instead, the researchers estimate that up to 15 million people across Europe had been infected by the beginning of May.The researchers say at most, 4% of the population in those countries had been infected. ""Claims this is all over can be firmly rejected. We are only at the beginning of this pandemic,"" said Dr Flaxman.And it means that as lockdowns start to lift, there is the risk the virus could start to spread again.""There is a very real risk if mobility goes back up there could be a second wave coming reasonably soon, in the next month or two,"" said Dr Samir Bhatt.Meanwhile, a separate study by University of California, Berkeley, analysed the impact of lockdowns in China, South Korea, Iran, France and the US.Their report, also in Nature, says lockdown prevented 530 million infections in those countries. Just before lockdowns were introduced, they said cases were doubling every two days.

Coronavirus: What is the k number and can superspreading be stopped?,"As the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus, scientists have another target in their sights - the superspreading event, when one person infects many others. And there is a new number that's key to understanding why that happens. During the pandemic, there has been a focus on the reproduction or R number. This is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average.However, not every person with coronavirus passes it on to the same number of people. Some may self-isolate and infect nobody, while others go about their life and infect many people.This is where the k number is useful. It measures the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects. The smaller the k number is, the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is. This means more superspreaders, each individually infecting higher numbers of people.About 10-15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections, according to an expert.Dr Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), says: ""Typically, what happens is a lot of people don't give the infection to anyone. ""And then there's a handful of events where you see large amounts of transmission happening with five, 10, 20 people potentially infected. And we saw that even quite early on with Covid.""Covid-19 is passed on through people shedding virus particles from their bodies.How infectious someone is depends on many factors that differ dramatically from person to person, including:But it is what they do when they are at their most infectious that really drives superspreading events.""If someone, when they're most transmissible, happens to go to an all-day meeting with a large number of people, and then go out for dinner afterwards, you may well see a superspreading event,"" Dr Kucharski says.""If that person happened to have an evening at home, it might not have generated any transmission.""Scientists have been keeping track of clusters of Covid-19 since the pandemic began.Dr Gwen Knight, from LSHTM, says: ""We found that many of the settings are what we expected. ""So care settings - hospitals and care homes - unfortunately, are coming up. ""And also cruise ships, which is something we know from other infectious diseases.""But she also found clusters repeatedly appearing in other places - meat-processing plants, choirs, bars and gyms.All of these involve being indoors, in close contact with others, for prolonged periods of time.But Dr Knight says there is another common thread.""These settings are likely to be loud settings, and obviously, that has an impact on the kind of breathing you do,"" she says. ""There is the hypothesis that because it's loud, and you're expelling more or faster air, it could be this that makes the setting more and more risky.""There were several clusters linked to fitness classes in South Korea, and more were linked to Zumba classes than to pilates classes. ""So it might be that you're engaged in an exercise that requires you to breathe more heavily and deeper, as opposed to a more gentle breathing, for example.""Dr Muge Cevik, of the University of St Andrews, says: ""Not all activities, not all environments have the same risk of infection.""So, for example, the risk of infection would be higher indoors compared to outdoors.""Outdoors, generally people worry about cyclists or runners passing by - but that would be lower risk. We could say the transmission risk is negligible.""Whereas if you spend a whole day together, in a big group in a park, and if you exchange lots of food and you have really close contact, less than 2m (6ft), the risk is lower than being indoors - but there is still risk.""Hand-washing, social distancing and not sharing utensils is essential, she says.Strict lockdowns were a blunt tool for halting the spread of coronavirus.But as infections decrease, and the world opens up, scientists say a more targeted approach is needed,Dr Cevik says: ""We need to understand the transmission dynamics so we can concentrate our contact-tracing focus. ""But if we can avoid these superspreading events, and the environments and activities associated with them, you can decrease almost 80% of infections. ""And that's huge.""

Coronavirus: Blood clots targeted in treatment trial,"Scientists are to test whether an experimental drug can prevent potentially deadly blood clots associated with Covid-19.The trial, funded by the British Heart Foundation, will test the theory the clots are caused by a hormone imbalance triggered by coronavirus infection.It will become one of several drugs currently being trialled to prevent the disease's worst effects.  A third of hospitalised coronavirus patients develop dangerous blood clots. The drug, TRV027, works to rebalance hormones involved in blood pressure, water and salt. Scientists from Imperial College London, involved in the trial, think that when the virus enters the body, it uses an enzyme as a ""handle"" to enter the cells. But this disables the enzyme, which plays an important role in balancing the key hormones. When out of balance, the blood can become sticky, leading to clots.They theorise that TRV027 - which won its creator a Nobel Prize in 2012 - can step in to play this rebalancing role.Many of the treatments being trialled to treat Covid-19 focus on the body's inflammatory response. But the hormonal imbalance is a ""quite distinct problem"" which may provide clues to the question of why some people get severely ill why others do not, says Dr David Owen, one of the study's leads.Blood clotting could also explain why Covid-19 seems to particularly affect people who already have cardiovascular disease despite being a respiratory illness, according to the British Heart Foundation.Since Covid-19 is such a complex disease which effects many of the body's systems, this treatment could be used in combination with other drugs says Dr Kat Pollock, a joint lead on the study. About 60 patients will be given either the new experimental drug, or a placebo, starting next month. It has been shown to be safe in patients with acute heart failure, although it was not effective as a treatment for this condition.  TRV027 is just one of several different drugs being trialled to ease the disease's worst effects or help the body fight it off. At least 10 different antiviral drugs including HIV treatment lopinavir/ritonavir are being, or have been trialled to see if they can help fight off the disease.None has yet been shown to be effective on its own, although there is still hope several could be used together to shorten patients' illnesses. Remdesivir, a drug that has shown promising effects, works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs in order to replicate inside body cells.Meanwhile plasma - the liquid part of blood - taken from people who have recovered from coronavirus might also help, by giving sick people who haven't recovered the right antibodies to fight it off. And a number of other treatments are focusing on the body's dangerous inflammatory response to fighting Covid-19, known as cytokine release syndrome.

Coronavirus: Who should wear a face mask or face covering?,"Face coverings on public transport - and for hospital staff, outpatients and visitors - will be compulsory in England from Monday.This is in line with new World Health Organization (WHO) advice. It says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible.Anyone travelling by bus, train, ferry or plane in England should wear a face covering from Monday - to help reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission.The new rules coincide with a further easing of lockdown - including the return to class of some secondary school pupils and the reopening of non-essential shops.The number of people using public transport is expected to increase.The government stresses people should:Some passengers will be exempt from the new rules including:If it is ""reasonably necessary"" for you to eat or drink you can remove the face covering to do so.The rules will apply only on public transport - not while waiting - but the rail industry will ask people to cover their face as they enter a station.People could be refused travel if they don't follow the rules. They could also be fined, but this will be the last resort.Public transport excludes cruise ships, school transport, taxis and private hire vehicles. However, ride-sharing company Uber is making face coverings compulsory.People in Wales are being asked to wear non-medical face coverings where social distancing is not possible - including public transport. But the government stopped short of making their use mandatory.Similar advice has been given by Northern Ireland's first minister and deputy first minister. In Scotland, it is recommended you consider using face coverings in limited circumstances - such as public transport - as a precautionary measure.The government has been careful to use the term ""face covering"" rather than ""face mask"".Transport Minister Grant Shapps said passengers should wear ""the kind of face covering you can easily make at home"" - with surgical masks kept for medical use.Common household items, such as cotton fabric from old T-shirts or bedding, can be turned into face coverings. The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own. The government has issued its own advice too.All hospital visitors and outpatients in England are being told to wear non-medical face coverings from Monday - although no-one will be denied care, and coverings will be provided by hospitals if necessary.NHS England has now lifted its suspension of hospital visiting - but rules are at the discretion of individual trusts.Health staff already wear masks in clinical areas within 2m (6ft) of a patient - but they will now have to wear surgical masks at all times, in all areas.The most protective mask for health staff is an FFP3 or, alternatively, an N95 or an FFP2.The WHO has updated its guidelines on face masks - and now recommends non-medical, fabric coverings should be worn by anyone aged under 60 on public transport and in some enclosed work environments.It says they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"" in areas where ""physical distancing of at least one metre is not possible"".The WHO recommends people aged over 60, or anyone of any age with an underlying health condition, should wear a medical-grade mask in those environments.The same goes for anyone with Covid-19 symptoms (even mild) and those caring for them.Healthcare workers should wear medical masks when providing any patient care.Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people talk, cough or sneeze. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces.Homemade cloth face coverings can help reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms. This is called asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission.Scientists in Singapore suggest the contagion risk is especially high in the 24-48 hours before an infected person is even aware they might have the disease.There is a risk of contamination when taking a face covering on and off - the WHO has issued advice.
