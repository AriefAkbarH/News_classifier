'Do it at home' coronavirus saliva test trialled,"A new ""no swab"" saliva coronavirus test that lets people collect their own sample at home by spitting into a pot is being trialled in the UK.More than 14,000 GP staff and other key workers, along with the people they live with, will take part. The pilot, led by Southampton University, will run for four weeks. Experts hope a saliva test will be an easier option for people - swabs can be uncomfortable and need to go deep into the nose and throat. The tests are designed to identify if a person is currently infected with coronavirus. Participants in the trial, which will include some university staff and students, will provide weekly saliva samples for lab testing. The kit will be delivered to their home or workplace and then collected by staff working for the trial team or returned to an agreed location. It could potentially spot people who are infected but have no symptoms, yet still risk passing the disease on to others. The trial is in addition to routine coronavirus testing already being offered to NHS staff and any people with symptoms. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was grateful to everyone involved in the trial: ""Saliva testing could potentially make it easier for people to take coronavirus tests at home, without having to use swabs. This trial will also help us learn if routine, at-home testing could pick up cases of the virus earlier.""Anyone who tests positive for the virus will be asked to self-isolate to avoid spreading the infection. The saliva test looks for genetic material of the virus using a technique known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Experts say this can be simpler and faster to carry out than the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing method used to analyse coronavirus swabs.Ultimately, it might be possible to do the testing as well as the sampling at home and get results in under an hour.

Coronavirus: What is a second wave and is one coming?,"Coronavirus is far from over. Some countries are still dealing with large epidemics, but even those currently controlling the virus fear ""the second wave"".The second phase of Spanish flu a century ago was deadlier than the first. So, is a second wave inevitable? And how bad could it be?You can think of it like waves on the sea. The number of infections goes up and then comes back down again - each cycle is one ""wave"" of coronavirus.Yet there is no formal definition.""It's not particularly scientific: how you define a wave is arbitrary,"" Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick, told the BBC. Some describe any rise as a second wave, but it is often a bumpy first wave. This is happening in some US states. In order to say one wave has ended, the virus would have been brought under control and cases fallen substantially.For a second wave to start you would need a sustained rise in infections. New Zealand, which has its first cases after 24 days without coronavirus, and Beijing, which is facing an outbreak after 50 virus-free days, are not in this position.

Nobody is 100% sure how far we can go. That is why measures are being lifted in stages and new ways of controlling coronavirus are being introduced, such as contact tracing or face coverings. ""In the UK and neighbouring countries, flare-ups could happen quite quickly if measures are lifted beyond the point transmission is controlled,"" says Dr Kucharski. This is already starting in Germany, where 650 people have tested positive for the virus after an outbreak at an abattoir.It is not a major problem if clusters can be rapidly identified, local lockdowns introduced and spread of the virus stopped.Otherwise, they contribute to a second wave.South Korea, which has been widely praised for its handling of the coronavirus, has had to re-impose some restrictions due to such clusters.

The value of R - the number of people each infected person passed the virus to on average - was 3 at the start of the pandemic.It meant the virus was spreading fast, but our behaviour has changed, we're social distancing, and it's hard to see how R will get that high again. Dr Kucharski told the BBC: ""No country is going to just lift everything and go back to normal.""Even countries without control of coronavirus - like Brazil and India - don't have an R of 3.0.""If cases did start to grow again, it is likely to be relatively slow.

Even HIV seems to be getting milder. The theory goes that viruses will spread further if they don't kill their host and so become milder.""But it's not guaranteed. It's a bit of a lazy thing some virologists trot out,"" says Prof Ball. It is also something that takes place over long periods of time. More than six months into the pandemic there is no clear evidence the virus has mutated to spread more easily or be less deadly. Prof Ball adds: ""I think the virus is doing very well at the minute.

Coronavirus: South Asian people most likely to die in hospital,"South Asian people are the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital in Great Britain, major analysis shows. It is the only ethnic group to have a raised risk of death in hospital and is partly due to high levels of diabetes. The study is hugely significant as it assessed data from four-in-10 of all hospital patients with Covid-19.The researchers said policies such as protecting people at work and who gets a vaccine may now need to change.Twenty-seven institutions across the UK,  including universities and public health bodies, as well as 260 hospitals, were involved in the study.The findings have been made public online ahead of being formally published in a medical journal. However, the results were passed onto the UK government's scientific advisory group - Sage - more than a month ago.The study tells us only what happens once somebody is admitted to hospital, not whether they were more likely to catch the virus.It looked at nearly 35,000 Covid-19 patients in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales up until the middle of May.""South Asians are definitely more likely to die from Covid-19 in hospital, but we don't see a strong effect in the black group,"" Prof Ewen Harrison, from the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC. People from South Asian backgrounds were 20% more likely to die than white people. Other minority ethnic groups did not have a higher death rate. The study, the largest of its type in the world, shows:The study also reveals profound differences in who is needing hospital care based on ethnicity. ""The South Asian population in hospital looks completely different to the white population,"" Prof Harrison said.He added: ""They're 12 years younger on average, that's a massive difference, and they tend not to have dementia, obesity or lung disease, but very high levels of diabetes."" Around 40% of South Asian patients had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes compared with 25% of white groups.Diabetes has a dual effect of increasing the risk of infection and damaging the body's organs, which may affect the ability to survive a coronavirus infection. This is thought to be a major factor in increasing the death rate in people of South Asian ethnicity, but the full picture has not yet been uncovered.Other explanations could include poverty or subtle genetic differences that increase the risk of serious infection, the researchers say.The report says ethnicity may now need to be considered alongside age and other health issues when deciding who gets a vaccine if one becomes available. The same issue crops up in deciding who should be shielding and whether some people need extra protection in the workplace. ""It does have far-reaching implications that are difficult to grapple with,"" Prof Harrison told the BBC.""Should there be a different policy for a frontline South Asian nurse to a white nurse - that's what's really tricky.""The study showed all ethnic minorities were more likely to need intensive care than people from white backgrounds. This may be partly due to the disease becoming more severe. However, another factor is white people were older and sicker so ventilation in intensive care may not be an option. The differences, however, were not about access to healthcare.The report showed that all ethnicities arrived in hospital in roughly the same stage of Covid-19 suggesting there is no delay in getting help between ethnicities.Earlier work by Public Health England showed people of Bangladeshi heritage were dying at twice the rate of white people, while other black, Asian and minority ethnic groups had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death. Although that did not account for other factors such as occupation, health problems and obesity.Meanwhile, work by Queen Mary University of London has suggested heart disease and vitamin D levels do not explain the increased risk of coronavirus in black, Asian and minority ethnic people. Both had been suggested as potential explanations for the greater risk in some groups.The researchers used data from the UK Biobank study. It is following people throughout their lives, including during the pandemic, and has detailed personal and medical information on people taking part.It did not look at deaths, rather who was testing positive for the virus in hospital. Their study, published in the Journal of Public Health, showed weight, poverty and crowded homes all contributed to a higher chance of having the virus. Researchers Dr Zahra Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Steffen Petersen told the BBC: ""Although some of the factors we studied appeared important, none of them adequately explained the ethnicity differences."" Even after taking them into account, people from ethnic minorities were still 59% more likely to test positive than those from white backgrounds and the reason remains unknown.Dr Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Petersen added: ""This is a really important question and one that we need to address urgently. ""There are a wide range of possible explanations including sociological, economic, occupational and other biological factors such as different genetic susceptibilities that need to be considered.""

If we were only just controlling the virus, even a small seasonal-boost could lead to the virus spreading.""Spring undoubtedly helped us,"" Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, says.""A second wave is almost inevitable, particularly as we go towards the winter months.""The challenge for government is to ensure the peak isn't so much that it overburdens the healthcare system.""One argument against a deadly second wave is that viruses become less dangerous as they evolve, to better infect people. Even HIV seems to be getting milder. The theory goes that viruses will spread further if they don't kill their host and so become milder.""But it's not guaranteed. It's a bit of a lazy thing some virologists trot out,"" says Prof Ball. It is also something that takes place over long periods of time. More than six months into the pandemic there is no clear evidence the virus has mutated to spread more easily or be less deadly. Prof Ball adds: ""I think the virus is doing very well at the minute. People often have very mild or symptomless infection. If they can transmit, then there is no reason to imagine coronavirus needs to become milder.""Follow James on Twitter",21 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: South Asian people most likely to die in hospital,"South Asian people are the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital in Great Britain, major analysis shows. It is the only ethnic group to have a raised risk of death in hospital and is partly due to high levels of diabetes. The study is hugely significant as it assessed data from four-in-10 of all hospital patients with Covid-19.The researchers said policies such as protecting people at work and who gets a vaccine may now need to change.Twenty-seven institutions across the UK,  including universities and public health bodies, as well as 260 hospitals, were involved in the study.The findings have been made public online ahead of being formally published in a medical journal. However, the results were passed onto the UK government's scientific advisory group - Sage - more than a month ago.The study tells us only what happens once somebody is admitted to hospital, not whether they were more likely to catch the virus.It looked at nearly 35,000 Covid-19 patients in 260 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales up until the middle of May.""South Asians are definitely more likely to die from Covid-19 in hospital, but we don't see a strong effect in the black group,"" Prof Ewen Harrison, from the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC. People from South Asian backgrounds were 20% more likely to die than white people. Other minority ethnic groups did not have a higher death rate. The study, the largest of its type in the world, shows:The study also reveals profound differences in who is needing hospital care based on ethnicity. ""The South Asian population in hospital looks completely different to the white population,"" Prof Harrison said.He added: ""They're 12 years younger on average, that's a massive difference, and they tend not to have dementia, obesity or lung disease, but very high levels of diabetes."" Around 40% of South Asian patients had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes compared with 25% of white groups.Diabetes has a dual effect of increasing the risk of infection and damaging the body's organs, which may affect the ability to survive a coronavirus infection. This is thought to be a major factor in increasing the death rate in people of South Asian ethnicity, but the full picture has not yet been uncovered.Other explanations could include poverty or subtle genetic differences that increase the risk of serious infection, the researchers say.The report says ethnicity may now need to be considered alongside age and other health issues when deciding who gets a vaccine if one becomes available. The same issue crops up in deciding who should be shielding and whether some people need extra protection in the workplace. ""It does have far-reaching implications that are difficult to grapple with,"" Prof Harrison told the BBC.""Should there be a different policy for a frontline South Asian nurse to a white nurse - that's what's really tricky.""The study showed all ethnic minorities were more likely to need intensive care than people from white backgrounds. This may be partly due to the disease becoming more severe. However, another factor is white people were older and sicker so ventilation in intensive care may not be an option. The differences, however, were not about access to healthcare.The report showed that all ethnicities arrived in hospital in roughly the same stage of Covid-19 suggesting there is no delay in getting help between ethnicities.Earlier work by Public Health England showed people of Bangladeshi heritage were dying at twice the rate of white people, while other black, Asian and minority ethnic groups had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death. Although that did not account for other factors such as occupation, health problems and obesity.Meanwhile, work by Queen Mary University of London has suggested heart disease and vitamin D levels do not explain the increased risk of coronavirus in black, Asian and minority ethnic people. Both had been suggested as potential explanations for the greater risk in some groups.The researchers used data from the UK Biobank study. It is following people throughout their lives, including during the pandemic, and has detailed personal and medical information on people taking part.It did not look at deaths, rather who was testing positive for the virus in hospital. Their study, published in the Journal of Public Health, showed weight, poverty and crowded homes all contributed to a higher chance of having the virus. Researchers Dr Zahra Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Steffen Petersen told the BBC: ""Although some of the factors we studied appeared important, none of them adequately explained the ethnicity differences."" Even after taking them into account, people from ethnic minorities were still 59% more likely to test positive than those from white backgrounds and the reason remains unknown.Dr Raisi-Estabragh and Prof Petersen added: ""This is a really important question and one that we need to address urgently. ""There are a wide range of possible explanations including sociological, economic, occupational and other biological factors such as different genetic susceptibilities that need to be considered.""

Coronavirus: What is dexamethasone and how does it work?,"An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19.  A UK trial showed the drug could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and it can be used in the NHS immediately. Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. This drug works by dampening down the body's immune system.Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off.  But sometimes the immune system goes into overdrive and it's this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body's own cells.Dexamethasone calms this effect. It's only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell.The drug does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford.It's testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19.About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days.Their progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment.Scientists hope dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further.It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply.The UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial.The drug costs from £5.40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. It was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it's been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make the drug and it is widely available around the world. The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to the government's parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms.The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too.In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars.In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, the government has already been advised to use it to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support.Data from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions.The drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body.Common side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention.Rarer side effects include eye disorders, blurred vision and haemorrhage.However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were ""no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population"".Prof Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. Trials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus-  were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not. ""It's been a huge ongoing debate,"" says Prof Horby.Scientists are trialling other steroids, such as methylprednisolone, in coronavirus patients with some promising early results.",18 June 2020,health
Coronavirus: Male plasma contains higher levels of antibodies,"Men who have had coronavirus are being urged to donate plasma from their blood to be used in research into treatments for Covid-19.Studies suggest men are more likely to become seriously ill and therefore produce higher levels of antibodies than women.This means their plasma could be more useful for saving lives.NHS Blood and Transplant says the plasma could be used to treat hospital patients if trials are successful.It started requesting blood and plasma from Covid survivors in April and, by mid-May, nearly 600 people had donated their plasma.Of the donations from men, 43% had high enough levels of antibodies to be used in trials, compared with just 29% of those from women.Higher antibody levels were also more often found in older patients, Asian patients and those who had been treated in hospital for Covid-19.""We'd still like to hear from anybody who had coronavirus or the symptoms,"" Prof David Roberts, associate director for blood donation at NHS Blood and Transplant, said.""More plasma donors are needed.""But we would especially want to hear from men.""Not everyone can donate plasma - the first step is to fill out a form on the NHS Blood and Transplant website.Simon Callon, 51, from St Helens, Merseyside, donated his plasma after he became unwell with coronavirus and lost his father, Noel, to Covid-19.""It was a no-brainer, really,"" he says, ""and very easy to do.""Simon did not have a cough when he was infected but he did have ""piercing headaches"" and shivered at night for a few days. He was able to be tested because his partner works for the NHS.A few weeks later, his father became ill and was admitted to hospital with low oxygen levels but did not survive.""I don't want anybody going through what happened to my dad,"" Simon says. ""He died on a hospital ward with no family or friends, with a nurse holding his hand. ""Only 10 people were allowed at his funeral.""If you can save somebody or help somebody, you would do it."" It's a yellow-ish liquid that makes up about half of blood volume and carries red and white blood cells and platelets around the body.After someone is infected with a virus, the plasma contains antibodies used to help fight infection.This antibody-rich plasma - called convalescent plasma - is formed when someone has recovered from Covid-19, usually 28 days after being ill.This convalescent plasma could be given to Covid-19 patients by transfusion (like blood) to help them fight off the disease and improve their chances of survival.Two clinical trials in the UK, Remap-Cap and Recovery, are under way to test out how well this works.Other trials using plasma as a treatment are taking place in the US and elsewhere.Only those who have had coronavirus symptoms and only once they have fully recovered, giving time for antibodies to develop.Donors need to go to one of 23 donor centre in various cities across England.It's different. The process takes about 45 minutes and separates plasma from the blood as you donate.The body usually replaces the plasma donated in 48 hours.",23 June 2020,health
Cancer drug: New treatment halts tumour growth,"A drug that could stop cancer cells repairing themselves has shown early signs of working. More than half of the 40 patients given berzosertib had the growth of their tumours halted.Berzosertib was even more effective when given alongside chemotherapy, the trial run by the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the Royal Marsden NHS Trust suggested.The trial was designed to test the safety of the drug.The drug is the first to be trialled of a new family of treatments, which block a protein involved in DNA repair.Blocking this protein prevents cancers from mending damage to their cells. It's part of a branch of treatment known as ""precision medicine"", which targets specific genes or genetic changes. The study involved patients with very advanced tumours, for whom no other treatment had worked. This was what is known as a ""phase one"" trial, which is only designed to test the safety of a treatment. But the ICR said the researchers did find some early indications that berzosertib could stop tumours growing.One of the study's authors, Prof Chris Lord, a professor of cancer genomics at the ICR, said these early signs were ""very promising"", adding that it was unusual in phase one trials to see a clinical response. Further trials will be needed to demonstrate the drug's effectiveness, though.  ""This study involved only small numbers of patients...Therefore, it is too early to consider berzosertib a game changer in cancer treatment,"" said Dr Darius Widera at the University of Reading.""Nevertheless, the unusually strong effects of berzosertib, especially in combination with conventional chemotherapy, give reasons to be optimistic regarding the outcomes of follow-up studies.""One patient in the trial, with advanced bowel cancer, had his tumours completely disappear after treatment with berzosertib, and has remained cancer-free for two years.Another, whose ovarian cancer returned following a different course of treatment, saw her tumours shrink after combination treatment with the drug and chemotherapy.Chemotherapy works by damaging cancer cells' DNA, so using it in conjunction with this new treatment, which stops the cells from repairing themselves, appears to give an even greater benefit. And berzosertib is able to target tumour cells without affecting other healthy cells, Prof Lord said. ""Our new clinical trial is the first to test the safety of a brand-new family of targeted cancer drugs in people, and it's encouraging to see some clinical responses even in at this early stage,"" said Professor Johann de Bono, head of drug development at the ICR and the Royal Marsden.In the future, these drugs could be used to ""boost the effect of treatments like chemotherapy"" and tackle resistance that could develop to other targeted treatments, he added. Whereas the traditional approach to cancer treatment has been to categorise it by tumour site - breast cancer, lung cancer and so on - the precision-medicine approach targets the genetic abnormality in the tumour, regardless of where it is. Precision approaches are already used, for example in prostate cancers to block the effect of the testosterone hormone involved in the tumour's growth. If used alone this could provide a less aggressive option than chemotherapy, which attacks cells indiscriminately. The next phase of trialling berzosertib is already under way.

Coronavirus: Shielding to stop at end of July in England,"The 2.2 million people who have been self-isolating in England during the pandemic will no longer need to shield from 1 August.From 6 July, they will be able to meet up outdoors, in a group, with up to five others and form 'support bubbles' with other households.The measures can be eased because infection rates are falling, the government says.Support packages will remain until the end of July to help people transition.Those who are shielding and live alone in England - including single parents who are shielding - will be able to create a support bubble with one other household of any size.This follows the 'social bubble' rules which were introduced earlier this month for anyone living alone and single-parent households.People shielding will also be able to meet in groups of up to six outdoors while maintaining social distancing rules.Still shielding: 'The novelty has certainly worn off'Extremely vulnerable people who are most at risk from becoming ill from coronavirus will no longer need to shield in England.That means they can return to work, if they can't work from home, as long as their workplace is COVID secure.However, they should still follow social distancing guidelines when outside their homes and wash their hands regularly to reduce the risk of being infected. The changes mean those shielding will no longer be eligible for statutory sick pay - unless they develop coronavirus symptoms, or someone they know develops symptoms, and they are told to self-isolate and cannot work from home.Free essential food boxes will stop being delivered, but support from NHS volunteers and local councils is still possible.They will still qualify for priority slots for online shopping and will be offered help with medicine deliveries and getting to medical appointments.The UK government says the advice can be relaxed because the chances of encountering the virus in the community continue to fall - one in 1,700 people are estimated to have the virus now, down from 1 in 500 four weeks ago.  The government says it has worked with clinicians, GPs, charities, the voluntary sector and patient groups on the changes.  But some charities are criticising the relaxing of the advice, saying many of the people they support do not feel it is safe to stop shielding.""We know how difficult this period has been and the impact shielding has had on many people's mental health,"" says Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer.""We believe it is the right time to relax some of the advice so people can start to regain a degree of normality once more in their daily lives."" But she added the advice on shielding could change again ""if there are any changes in the rates of infection that could impact on this group"".As the country went into lockdown, around two million people were sent letters by their GPs telling them not to leave home and to avoid contact with others.This was to protect them from the virus because they were considered to be most at risk from Covid-19.Among the list of people who should be shielding are solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women with heart disease and people with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and severe asthma.Over half of those shielding are under the age of 70; more than 90,000 are children.Since the start of June, people shielding in England were told they could go out once a day - to meet one person from another household while adhering to social distancing.From the beginning of August, that shielding advice is to be completely relaxed.The NHS will keep the shielded list, in case more advice needs to given to this group in future.Northern Ireland has already said people will no longer need to shield from 31 July.But officials say this pausing of the advice will only happen if the rate of community transmission remains low.People who are shielding and living alone in Northern Ireland will also be able to form a support bubble from 6 July with one other household.Until then, people shielding across the UK are advised to stay at home as much as possible and to practise social distancing when they go outside.In Scotland, the advice applies to around 180,000 people and is in place until at least 31 July.Meanwhile in Wales, almost 130,000 people are shielding and the Chief Medical Officer for Wales says the current guidance runs until at least 16 August.Have you been shielding?
