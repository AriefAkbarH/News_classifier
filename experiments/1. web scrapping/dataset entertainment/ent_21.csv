Coronavirus: £2.5m musicians' fund runs out of cash,"A £2.5m fund set up to help musicians during the coronavirus crisis is set to run out of cash after just five days.More than 3,500 people have applied for financial assistance since Friday, says the charity Help Musicians UK.But with the fund reaching capacity, and live music a distant prospect, other applicants may be left stranded.""It's a bigger, longer crisis than any of us could have thought possible,"" said the charity's chief executive, Jack Ainscough.Touring and gigging musicians have been particularly affected by the lockdown, as months of work simply vanished in mid-March.Many of them (up to 25%) are not covered by the government's scheme to support freelancers, and have no other source of income during the lockdown.The current Help Musicians fund is targeted at those self-employed workers, following a first phase in March that offered one-off grants of £500 to any musician facing immediate financial difficulties. That scheme handed out over £8m to nearly 17,000 musicians in just four weeks, including The Waterboys' drummer Ralph Salmins.""My work is not coming back till March or April next year,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't know what I'm going to do.""The musician, who has performed or recorded with Paul McCartney, Bjork, Aretha Franklin and Madonna, as well as appearing on more than 150 film soundtracks, said the industry could be facing ""a two-year lull"" before returning to normal.""We're really, really in a corner in the arts and I don't think, unfortunately, the government has quite cottoned on to it,"" he said.""It's really grisly. It's very, very dire.""A study conducted by Help Musicians found that 99% of musicians had worried about their financial situation during lockdown, while 46% said the impact on their wellbeing had been ""strong or severe"".""One of the points for us, is that financial hardship funding isn't just about financial hardship,"" Mr Ainscough explained. ""It's actually about reducing anxiety, which reduces the likelihood of tripping into more serious mental health issues. ""It's about stopping someone becoming homeless, stopping somebody from having to go couch-surfing, and keeping them in a state where actually they've got a hope of remaining creative.""He added that, while most people think of musicians as being Stormzy or Dua Lipa, the vast majority live a much more meagre existence.""After the first round of grants, one lady wrote back to me and said, 'I've never been more excited to pay my rent,'"" Mr Ainscough recalled.Help Musicians, along with the Musicians Union, is calling on the government to provide extra help to freelancers in the arts who are suffering financial difficulties.""This is a much longer-term problem than for other sectors of the economy, which can open up now,"" said Mr Ainscough.The charity is also seeking donations to top up the fund - which was initially drawn from its own reserves, combined with £500,000 from music rights organisation PPL and £50,000 from Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol.Another supporter is Squeeze's Chris Difford, who held an online fund-raiser for the charity last week. ""I got involved because a friend of mine, who suffers from depression, is a fabulous writer and found themselves without any money and without anywhere to go. ""He turned to Help Musicians and he got a grant, and he was really buoyed up by the support,"" he told the BBC. ""So I was impressed by what I saw.""Difford, whose hits include Tempted, Up The Junction and Cool For Cats, added that, like many musicians, touring had been his main source of income for the past 15 years - but he couldn't see concerts resuming soon.""I'd love live music to come back as soon as possible but I just don't know where the confidence is going to come from,"" he said.""If somebody said to me, 'You've got an American tour in three months' time,' I would definitely have to sort of take a very deep breath about it and think it through.""",9 June 2020,entertainment

Drake and Ariana Grande's record label drops the term 'urban',"Republic Records, one of the most powerful record labels in the US, will stop using the word ""urban"" to describe music of black origin.The company, which is home to Drake and Ariana Grande, says it will no longer use the term to describe ""departments, employee titles and music genres"".""We encourage the rest of the music industry to follow suit,"" it added.The term is often considered to be a generalisation that marginalises music by black artists. ""'Urban' is a lazy, inaccurate generalisation of several culturally rich art forms,"" radio presenter DJ Semtex told the magazine Music Business UK in 2018.""I despise the word,"" he added. ""I know artists that do hip-hop, grime, or rap. I don't know anyone that does urban music.""The connotation of the word doesn't hold a positive weight,"" agreed Sam Taylor, a senior vice president at Kobalt Music, in an interview with Billboard in 2018.""It's downgrading R&B, soul and hip-hop's incredible impact on music."" #WeUseOurVoices, Use Yours.A post shared by  Republic Records (@republicrecords) on Jun 5, 2020 at 9:53am PDTEnd of Instagram post  by republicrecordsThe term dates back to the mid-1970s, when black New York radio DJ Frankie Crocker coined the phrase ""urban contemporary"" as a label for the eclectic mix of songs that he played - which covered everything from James Brown to Doris Day.At the time, the label didn't carry negative connotations but, after being shortened to ""urban"" it started being used as a catch-all for music created by black musicians - effectively lumping them into one category, regardless of genre.Republic Records reflected the growing discomfort around the term in a statement announcing it would remove the word from its company vocabulary.""'Urban' is rooted in the historical evolution of terms that sought to define black music,"" it said. ""As with a lot of our history, the original connotation of the term urban was not deemed negative. However, over time the meaning and connotations of 'urban' have shifted and it developed into a generalisation of black people in many sectors of the music industry, including employees and music by black artists. ""While this change will not and does not affect any of our staff structurally, it will remove the use of this antiquated term.""We encourage the rest of the music industry to consider following suit as it is important to shape the future of what we want it to look like, as to not adhere to the outdated structures of the past.""The label, whose roster also includes The Weeknd, Nicki Minaj, Post Malone and Taylor Swift, also announced the formation of an ""action committee"" to address social justice issues.Management company Milk & Honey, whose songwriters have contributed to hits by Drake & Rick Ross, The Chainsmokers, Dua Lipa and Selena Gomez also declared it would ""formally eliminate the term 'urban' at our company"".In a statement posted to social media, it said: ""We will no longer be using the term as we believe it's an important step forward, and an outdated word, which has no place in 2020 onwards."" Milk & Honey are glad to start the wave in removing the term “Urban” from the music business. More on Music Business Worldwide.A post shared by  Milk & Honey (@milkhoneyla) on Jun 5, 2020 at 1:13pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by milkhoneylaThe move comes in the wake of widespread protests in the US and UK over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis two weeks ago,A white police officer was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, while the 46-year-old repeated several times,  ""I can't breathe"". He was later pronounced dead in hospital.His death prompted hundreds of thousands to take to the streets demanding racial justice. The music industry responded by pausing work for a day last week, with Universal Music - Republic Records' parent company - establishing a ""task force to accelerate our efforts in areas such as inclusion and social justice"".However, others have said the industry needs widespread systemic change, rather than ""window dressing"".""Why is it that black music generates millions and millions of dollars a year and yet none of the companies have a meaningful number of employees of colour, let alone in the executive suite?"" asked senior music industry lawyer Ronald E. Sweeney in an open letter published on Sunday.Sweeney, who has represented the likes of James Brown, P Diddy and Public Enemy, drew up a 12-point plan to address what he called ""the elephant in the room"", including equal pay and the creation of a three-year programme to train people from minority backgrounds for executive roles.""[This]  is what meaningful and real change looks like,"" he wrote.

Why we need a say over public statues,"Typically, there are two kinds of Madame Tussauds news stories. The first is when there's a new waxwork made of a recently established celebrity (Dua Lipa). The second kind - which is way more fun because it's ripe with schadenfreude - is when a once famous person (Cheryl Cole) is removed because they have reduced currency in the public imagination.  There's nothing malicious in the decisions, it's business. If Madame Tussauds wants to stay relevant, and therefore solvent, it has to keep up with the times. Nobody is going to queue for hours on one of London's most polluted roads while the rain lashes down on their battered brolly to see a waxwork of someone in whom they have no interest, or possibly actively dislike. So, it is 'Yes' to Harry and Meghan (recently removed from the royal section) and 'No' to Jimmy Savile (melted down in 2012). Notwithstanding your intellectual or aesthetic reservations about Tussauds, you have to admit there is a logic to the visitor attraction's exhibition strategy.The same cannot be said for the country's approach to sculptures exhibited outside, in the public realm, of which there are thought to be around 20,000 - or 19,999 after the bronze likeness of slave trader Edward Colston was dispatched into Bristol harbour this weekend by protesters at an anti-racism demonstration. Whatever your opinion of that particular incident, it highlights a broader issue, which is a lack of open public debate about the thousands of statues installed in community spaces across the country. Should the citizens who live and use those public areas not be part of a discussion regarding the artworks selected for display? If the vast majority find an existing sculpture objectionable, why should they be subjected to its presence every day?Maybe, there's a good reason for a statue to remain. Fine. Let its merits be debated, and a democratic decision made on a way forward. Perhaps it could be re-sited, or contextual material added, or, in some cases, put in storage and the space used for an alternative artwork agreed by the local community. Any which way, give the people a say: who or what do they want to commemorate or celebrate?But, unlike Madame Tussauds, there is no overarching national strategic approach to the display of statues in public places. There is the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association, but it has no official mandate to make curatorial choices or impose policy. The decision is usually left with local councils, some of which have truly awful taste. Or, worse, are deaf to the community they represent.  Perhaps there should be an authorised body overseeing a coherent policy for sculpture in the public realm: a body consisting of experts that could constantly review the works exhibited just as the curators in a museum do for the objects for which they are responsible.  This informed, dedicated body could also be a place for debate, commissioning, programming, and exchange. Sculpture in the public realm could be treated like another national museum, with a director, specialist curators, conservators, and - most importantly - an education department that could collaborate with the local community and schools.It could provide more than a platform for discussions about what individual statues should and should not be shown, but also the chance to develop an exhibition plan in consultation with each area that would aim to enhance public spaces for the local population. The toppling of Colston's effigy could be the catalyst for a new community-focussed approach. As towns such as Harlow in Essex have shown, with its commitment to British modern sculptors such as Elisabeth Frink and Barbara Hepworth, a serious, planned approach to the exhibiting of outdoor artworks can not only enhance the space in which they sit, but also the area as a whole - giving it an identity and a cohesion: a reason for people to live there and a reason for people to visit. There is an opportunity to recast our approach to public sculpture, to transform the current hit-and-miss, generally unaccountable system, into a mould-breaking, country-spanning, new national Museum of Art in the Public Realm.

Coronavirus: Report suggests arts industry faces 'ruinous losses',"A cut in public funding has left the arts sector more exposed to the threat of Covid-19, new figures suggest.The latest Arts Index, published annually, showed public investment in arts per head of the population fell by 35% in the last decade.However, earned income by arts organisations from things like box office ticket sales increased by 47%. The government said it was working with the arts sector directly on how to reopen safely and plan for the future.The Arts Index is published by The National Campaign for the Arts (NCA), and acts as a snapshot report of the health of England's arts and culture.It is published in partnership with the Creative Industries Federation and King's College London and compares year-on-year figures using 20 key indicators.The latest index, published on Monday, puts the recent figures in the context of the last decade, which saw a UK recession prompt a shift in the income streams for arts organisations.While galleries and cinemas are putting plans in place to reopen, theatres and concert venues will remain closed for the foreseeable future. The chair of the NCA, Samuel West, said: ""Arts organisations rose to the challenge following the financial crash; we salute them for increasing earned income in response to a triple whammy of cuts to public funding, business sponsorship and philanthropic giving.  ""It's bitterly ironic that the arts sector's resourceful response to the 2008 financial crash is now the very thing that makes it vulnerable to the COVID-19 crisis, with theatres closed and income from tickets and bars dropping off a cliff.""The NCA said the sector had been ""brought to its knees"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding that many companies now face ""ruinous losses"".A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told BBC News: ""The government has announced unprecedented financial aid for the arts and cultural sectors, including the Self Employed Support Scheme, the job retention scheme, a year's business rates holiday, and the Arts Council's £160 million emergency response package. ""We want to help those organisations that have worked hard to become a commercial success, and we are working directly with the arts sector on how it can reopen safely and plan for the future.""In October, DCMS announced £250m of funding for the cultural and creative sector - the biggest one-off government investment in cultural infrastructure, local museums and neighbourhood libraries in the last century.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told The Evening Standard on Monday: ""I am not going to stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed... Of course I want to get the money flowing, I am not going to let anyone down.""Discussing his negotiations with the treasury about further financial aid, he said: ""Not everyone is going to be happy with whatever comes up. I'm going to have to ask institutions to take difficult decisions"".The latest index notes that the West End weathered the financial storm that started in 2008 particularly well, and since 2013 the sector saw real terms growth in revenues practically every year to 2018.It also states that financial support from arts trusts and foundations jumped by 38% between 2014 and 2018.However, the index showed the proportion of all GCSEs being taken in creative subjects is down 20% since 2010.",8 June 2020,entertainment

""I am no longer standing for it.""Her comments follow the Black Lives Matter protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd in police custody.Former Hollyoaks star Amanda Clapham supported Adedeji on Twitter, saying she witnessed ""micro-aggressions"" towards BAME staff on the show.Clapham alleged one male black cast member was ""disproportionately told off"" for talking and messing around during filming, when a whole group of actors had been involved.Andrea Ali, who plays Celeste Faroe, supported Adedeji but praised the soap's efforts on representation.""I am beyond blessed to be a part of a team as diverse and as inclusive as Hollyoaks,"" Ali said.""Celeste Faroe is a powerhouse and that representation of black women is not only one that I am proud of, but one that matters.""Last week, Hollyoaks announced it would address the Black Lives Matter movement by recording a series of special podcasts about racism.At the time, actress Kéllé Bryan said: ""We've been busy behind the scenes having lots of highly important conversations and we'll be kick-starting with a podcast all about racism - how we tackle it, how we face it and, most importantly, how we overcome it.""But in her statement, Adedeji said: ""Putting out a podcast and asking your black cast members to teach you how to tackle these issues is the bare minimum. Do better.""On Monday's Loose Women, Bryan addressed the backlash she'd received from the podcast announcement, but said there was no bad blood between herself and Adedeji.""Myself and Rachel have spoken and we have shared our feelings... I'm supporting her and she's reached out to me also. We'll just work through this, hopefully, internally.""She meant no harm in her post in terms of me personally.""In a statement to the ITV daytime show, Hollyoaks said: ""Lime Pictures has a zero tolerance approach to racism, in line with our commitment to do the right thing, we will review the matters that have been reported.""The BBC has contacted Lime Pictures for further comment.Hollyoaks is set to resume production in Liverpool this week, with the cast expected back on set in July.Adedeji first shot to fame as an X Factor finalist in 2009, finishing in ninth place. She joined Hollyoaks in 2016.",8 June 2020,entertainment

Coronavirus: £2.5m musicians' fund runs out of cash,"A £2.5m fund set up to help musicians during the coronavirus crisis is set to run out of cash after just five days.More than 3,500 people have applied for financial assistance since Friday, says the charity Help Musicians UK.But with the fund reaching capacity, and live music a distant prospect, other applicants may be left stranded.""It's a bigger, longer crisis than any of us could have thought possible,"" said the charity's chief executive, Jack Ainscough.Touring and gigging musicians have been particularly affected by the lockdown, as months of work simply vanished in mid-March.Many of them (up to 25%) are not covered by the government's scheme to support freelancers, and have no other source of income during the lockdown.The current Help Musicians fund is targeted at those self-employed workers, following a first phase in March that offered one-off grants of £500 to any musician facing immediate financial difficulties. That scheme handed out over £8m to nearly 17,000 musicians in just four weeks, including The Waterboys' drummer Ralph Salmins.""My work is not coming back till March or April next year,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't know what I'm going to do.""The musician, who has performed or recorded with Paul McCartney, Bjork, Aretha Franklin and Madonna, as well as appearing on more than 150 film soundtracks, said the industry could be facing ""a two-year lull"" before returning to normal.""We're really, really in a corner in the arts and I don't think, unfortunately, the government has quite cottoned on to it,"" he said.""It's really grisly. It's very, very dire.""A study conducted by Help Musicians found that 99% of musicians had worried about their financial situation during lockdown, while 46% said the impact on their wellbeing had been ""strong or severe"".""One of the points for us, is that financial hardship funding isn't just about financial hardship,"" Mr Ainscough explained. ""It's actually about reducing anxiety, which reduces the likelihood of tripping into more serious mental health issues. ""It's about stopping someone becoming homeless, stopping somebody from having to go couch-surfing, and keeping them in a state where actually they've got a hope of remaining creative.""He added that, while most people think of musicians as being Stormzy or Dua Lipa, the vast majority live a much more meagre existence.""After the first round of grants, one lady wrote back to me and said, 'I've never been more excited to pay my rent,'"" Mr Ainscough recalled.Help Musicians, along with the Musicians Union, is calling on the government to provide extra help to freelancers in the arts who are suffering financial difficulties.""This is a much longer-term problem than for other sectors of the economy, which can open up now,"" said Mr Ainscough.The charity is also seeking donations to top up the fund - which was initially drawn from its own reserves, combined with £500,000 from music rights organisation PPL and £50,000 from Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol.Another supporter is Squeeze's Chris Difford, who held an online fund-raiser for the charity last week. ""I got involved because a friend of mine, who suffers from depression, is a fabulous writer and found themselves without any money and without anywhere to go. ""He turned to Help Musicians and he got a grant, and he was really buoyed up by the support,"" he told the BBC. ""So I was impressed by what I saw.""Difford, whose hits include Tempted, Up The Junction and Cool For Cats, added that, like many musicians, touring had been his main source of income for the past 15 years - but he couldn't see concerts resuming soon.""I'd love live music to come back as soon as possible but I just don't know where the confidence is going to come from,"" he said.""If somebody said to me, 'You've got an American tour in three months' time,' I would definitely have to sort of take a very deep breath about it and think it through.""",9 June 2020,entertainment

Drake and Ariana Grande's record label drops the term 'urban',"Republic Records, one of the most powerful record labels in the US, will stop using the word ""urban"" to describe music of black origin.The company, which is home to Drake and Ariana Grande, says it will no longer use the term to describe ""departments, employee titles and music genres"".""We encourage the rest of the music industry to follow suit,"" it added.The term is often considered to be a generalisation that marginalises music by black artists. ""'Urban' is a lazy, inaccurate generalisation of several culturally rich art forms,"" radio presenter DJ Semtex told the magazine Music Business UK in 2018.""I despise the word,"" he added. ""I know artists that do hip-hop, grime, or rap. I don't know anyone that does urban music.""The connotation of the word doesn't hold a positive weight,"" agreed Sam Taylor, a senior vice president at Kobalt Music, in an interview with Billboard in 2018.""It's downgrading R&B, soul and hip-hop's incredible impact on music."" #WeUseOurVoices, Use Yours.A post shared by  Republic Records (@republicrecords) on Jun 5, 2020 at 9:53am PDTEnd of Instagram post  by republicrecordsThe term dates back to the mid-1970s, when black New York radio DJ Frankie Crocker coined the phrase ""urban contemporary"" as a label for the eclectic mix of songs that he played - which covered everything from James Brown to Doris Day.At the time, the label didn't carry negative connotations but, after being shortened to ""urban"" it started being used as a catch-all for music created by black musicians - effectively lumping them into one category, regardless of genre.Republic Records reflected the growing discomfort around the term in a statement announcing it would remove the word from its company vocabulary.""'Urban' is rooted in the historical evolution of terms that sought to define black music,"" it said. ""As with a lot of our history, the original connotation of the term urban was not deemed negative. However, over time the meaning and connotations of 'urban' have shifted and it developed into a generalisation of black people in many sectors of the music industry, including employees and music by black artists. ""While this change will not and does not affect any of our staff structurally, it will remove the use of this antiquated term.""We encourage the rest of the music industry to consider following suit as it is important to shape the future of what we want it to look like, as to not adhere to the outdated structures of the past.""The label, whose roster also includes The Weeknd, Nicki Minaj, Post Malone and Taylor Swift, also announced the formation of an ""action committee"" to address social justice issues.Management company Milk & Honey, whose songwriters have contributed to hits by Drake & Rick Ross, The Chainsmokers, Dua Lipa and Selena Gomez also declared it would ""formally eliminate the term 'urban' at our company"".In a statement posted to social media, it said: ""We will no longer be using the term as we believe it's an important step forward, and an outdated word, which has no place in 2020 onwards."" Milk & Honey are glad to start the wave in removing the term “Urban” from the music business. More on Music Business Worldwide.A post shared by  Milk & Honey (@milkhoneyla) on Jun 5, 2020 at 1:13pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by milkhoneylaThe move comes in the wake of widespread protests in the US and UK over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis two weeks ago,A white police officer was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, while the 46-year-old repeated several times,  ""I can't breathe"". He was later pronounced dead in hospital.His death prompted hundreds of thousands to take to the streets demanding racial justice. The music industry responded by pausing work for a day last week, with Universal Music - Republic Records' parent company - establishing a ""task force to accelerate our efforts in areas such as inclusion and social justice"".However, others have said the industry needs widespread systemic change, rather than ""window dressing"".""Why is it that black music generates millions and millions of dollars a year and yet none of the companies have a meaningful number of employees of colour, let alone in the executive suite?"" asked senior music industry lawyer Ronald E. Sweeney in an open letter published on Sunday.Sweeney, who has represented the likes of James Brown, P Diddy and Public Enemy, drew up a 12-point plan to address what he called ""the elephant in the room"", including equal pay and the creation of a three-year programme to train people from minority backgrounds for executive roles.""[This]  is what meaningful and real change looks like,"" he wrote.

Why we need a say over public statues,"Typically, there are two kinds of Madame Tussauds news stories. The first is when there's a new waxwork made of a recently established celebrity (Dua Lipa). The second kind - which is way more fun because it's ripe with schadenfreude - is when a once famous person (Cheryl Cole) is removed because they have reduced currency in the public imagination.  There's nothing malicious in the decisions, it's business. If Madame Tussauds wants to stay relevant, and therefore solvent, it has to keep up with the times. Nobody is going to queue for hours on one of London's most polluted roads while the rain lashes down on their battered brolly to see a waxwork of someone in whom they have no interest, or possibly actively dislike. So, it is 'Yes' to Harry and Meghan (recently removed from the royal section) and 'No' to Jimmy Savile (melted down in 2012). Notwithstanding your intellectual or aesthetic reservations about Tussauds, you have to admit there is a logic to the visitor attraction's exhibition strategy.The same cannot be said for the country's approach to sculptures exhibited outside, in the public realm, of which there are thought to be around 20,000 - or 19,999 after the bronze likeness of slave trader Edward Colston was dispatched into Bristol harbour this weekend by protesters at an anti-racism demonstration. Whatever your opinion of that particular incident, it highlights a broader issue, which is a lack of open public debate about the thousands of statues installed in community spaces across the country. Should the citizens who live and use those public areas not be part of a discussion regarding the artworks selected for display? If the vast majority find an existing sculpture objectionable, why should they be subjected to its presence every day?Maybe, there's a good reason for a statue to remain. Fine. Let its merits be debated, and a democratic decision made on a way forward. Perhaps it could be re-sited, or contextual material added, or, in some cases, put in storage and the space used for an alternative artwork agreed by the local community. Any which way, give the people a say: who or what do they want to commemorate or celebrate?But, unlike Madame Tussauds, there is no overarching national strategic approach to the display of statues in public places. There is the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association, but it has no official mandate to make curatorial choices or impose policy. The decision is usually left with local councils, some of which have truly awful taste. Or, worse, are deaf to the community they represent.  Perhaps there should be an authorised body overseeing a coherent policy for sculpture in the public realm: a body consisting of experts that could constantly review the works exhibited just as the curators in a museum do for the objects for which they are responsible.  This informed, dedicated body could also be a place for debate, commissioning, programming, and exchange. Sculpture in the public realm could be treated like another national museum, with a director, specialist curators, conservators, and - most importantly - an education department that could collaborate with the local community and schools.It could provide more than a platform for discussions about what individual statues should and should not be shown, but also the chance to develop an exhibition plan in consultation with each area that would aim to enhance public spaces for the local population. The toppling of Colston's effigy could be the catalyst for a new community-focussed approach. As towns such as Harlow in Essex have shown, with its commitment to British modern sculptors such as Elisabeth Frink and Barbara Hepworth, a serious, planned approach to the exhibiting of outdoor artworks can not only enhance the space in which they sit, but also the area as a whole - giving it an identity and a cohesion: a reason for people to live there and a reason for people to visit. There is an opportunity to recast our approach to public sculpture, to transform the current hit-and-miss, generally unaccountable system, into a mould-breaking, country-spanning, new national Museum of Art in the Public Realm.

Coronavirus: Report suggests arts industry faces 'ruinous losses',"A cut in public funding has left the arts sector more exposed to the threat of Covid-19, new figures suggest.The latest Arts Index, published annually, showed public investment in arts per head of the population fell by 35% in the last decade.However, earned income by arts organisations from things like box office ticket sales increased by 47%. The government said it was working with the arts sector directly on how to reopen safely and plan for the future.The Arts Index is published by The National Campaign for the Arts (NCA), and acts as a snapshot report of the health of England's arts and culture.It is published in partnership with the Creative Industries Federation and King's College London and compares year-on-year figures using 20 key indicators.The latest index, published on Monday, puts the recent figures in the context of the last decade, which saw a UK recession prompt a shift in the income streams for arts organisations.While galleries and cinemas are putting plans in place to reopen, theatres and concert venues will remain closed for the foreseeable future. The chair of the NCA, Samuel West, said: ""Arts organisations rose to the challenge following the financial crash; we salute them for increasing earned income in response to a triple whammy of cuts to public funding, business sponsorship and philanthropic giving.  ""It's bitterly ironic that the arts sector's resourceful response to the 2008 financial crash is now the very thing that makes it vulnerable to the COVID-19 crisis, with theatres closed and income from tickets and bars dropping off a cliff.""The NCA said the sector had been ""brought to its knees"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding that many companies now face ""ruinous losses"".A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told BBC News: ""The government has announced unprecedented financial aid for the arts and cultural sectors, including the Self Employed Support Scheme, the job retention scheme, a year's business rates holiday, and the Arts Council's £160 million emergency response package. ""We want to help those organisations that have worked hard to become a commercial success, and we are working directly with the arts sector on how it can reopen safely and plan for the future.""In October, DCMS announced £250m of funding for the cultural and creative sector - the biggest one-off government investment in cultural infrastructure, local museums and neighbourhood libraries in the last century.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told The Evening Standard on Monday: ""I am not going to stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed... Of course I want to get the money flowing, I am not going to let anyone down.""Discussing his negotiations with the treasury about further financial aid, he said: ""Not everyone is going to be happy with whatever comes up. I'm going to have to ask institutions to take difficult decisions"".The latest index notes that the West End weathered the financial storm that started in 2008 particularly well, and since 2013 the sector saw real terms growth in revenues practically every year to 2018.It also states that financial support from arts trusts and foundations jumped by 38% between 2014 and 2018.However, the index showed the proportion of all GCSEs being taken in creative subjects is down 20% since 2010.",8 June 2020,entertainment

Drake and Ariana Grande's record label drops the term 'urban',"Republic Records, one of the most powerful record labels in the US, will stop using the word ""urban"" to describe music of black origin.The company, which is home to Drake and Ariana Grande, says it will no longer use the term to describe ""departments, employee titles and music genres"".""We encourage the rest of the music industry to follow suit,"" it added.The term is often considered to be a generalisation that marginalises music by black artists. ""'Urban' is a lazy, inaccurate generalisation of several culturally rich art forms,"" radio presenter DJ Semtex told the magazine Music Business UK in 2018.""I despise the word,"" he added. ""I know artists that do hip-hop, grime, or rap. I don't know anyone that does urban music.""The connotation of the word doesn't hold a positive weight,"" agreed Sam Taylor, a senior vice president at Kobalt Music, in an interview with Billboard in 2018.""It's downgrading R&B, soul and hip-hop's incredible impact on music."" #WeUseOurVoices, Use Yours.A post shared by  Republic Records (@republicrecords) on Jun 5, 2020 at 9:53am PDTEnd of Instagram post  by republicrecordsThe term dates back to the mid-1970s, when black New York radio DJ Frankie Crocker coined the phrase ""urban contemporary"" as a label for the eclectic mix of songs that he played - which covered everything from James Brown to Doris Day.At the time, the label didn't carry negative connotations but, after being shortened to ""urban"" it started being used as a catch-all for music created by black musicians - effectively lumping them into one category, regardless of genre.Republic Records reflected the growing discomfort around the term in a statement announcing it would remove the word from its company vocabulary.""'Urban' is rooted in the historical evolution of terms that sought to define black music,"" it said. ""As with a lot of our history, the original connotation of the term urban was not deemed negative. However, over time the meaning and connotations of 'urban' have shifted and it developed into a generalisation of black people in many sectors of the music industry, including employees and music by black artists. ""While this change will not and does not affect any of our staff structurally, it will remove the use of this antiquated term.""We encourage the rest of the music industry to consider following suit as it is important to shape the future of what we want it to look like, as to not adhere to the outdated structures of the past.""The label, whose roster also includes The Weeknd, Nicki Minaj, Post Malone and Taylor Swift, also announced the formation of an ""action committee"" to address social justice issues.Management company Milk & Honey, whose songwriters have contributed to hits by Drake & Rick Ross, The Chainsmokers, Dua Lipa and Selena Gomez also declared it would ""formally eliminate the term 'urban' at our company"".In a statement posted to social media, it said: ""We will no longer be using the term as we believe it's an important step forward, and an outdated word, which has no place in 2020 onwards.""

More on Music Business Worldwide.A post shared by  Milk & Honey (@milkhoneyla) on Jun 5, 2020 at 1:13pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by milkhoneylaThe move comes in the wake of widespread protests in the US and UK over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis two weeks ago,A white police officer was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, while the 46-year-old repeated several times,  ""I can't breathe"". He was later pronounced dead in hospital.His death prompted hundreds of thousands to take to the streets demanding racial justice. The music industry responded by pausing work for a day last week, with Universal Music - Republic Records' parent company - establishing a ""task force to accelerate our efforts in areas such as inclusion and social justice"".However, others have said the industry needs widespread systemic change, rather than ""window dressing"".""Why is it that black music generates millions and millions of dollars a year and yet none of the companies have a meaningful number of employees of colour, let alone in the executive suite?"" asked senior music industry lawyer Ronald E. Sweeney in an open letter published on Sunday.Sweeney, who has represented the likes of James Brown, P Diddy and Public Enemy, drew up a 12-point plan to address what he called ""the elephant in the room"", including equal pay and the creation of a three-year programme to train people from minority backgrounds for executive roles.""[This]  is what meaningful and real change looks like,"" he wrote.

Why we need a say over public statues,"Typically, there are two kinds of Madame Tussauds news stories. The first is when there's a new waxwork made of a recently established celebrity (Dua Lipa). The second kind - which is way more fun because it's ripe with schadenfreude - is when a once famous person (Cheryl Cole) is removed because they have reduced currency in the public imagination.  There's nothing malicious in the decisions, it's business. If Madame Tussauds wants to stay relevant, and therefore solvent, it has to keep up with the times. Nobody is going to queue for hours on one of London's most polluted roads while the rain lashes down on their battered brolly to see a waxwork of someone in whom they have no interest, or possibly actively dislike. So, it is 'Yes' to Harry and Meghan (recently removed from the royal section) and 'No' to Jimmy Savile (melted down in 2012). Notwithstanding your intellectual or aesthetic reservations about Tussauds, you have to admit there is a logic to the visitor attraction's exhibition strategy.The same cannot be said for the country's approach to sculptures exhibited outside, in the public realm, of which there are thought to be around 20,000 - or 19,999 after the bronze likeness of slave trader Edward Colston was dispatched into Bristol harbour this weekend by protesters at an anti-racism demonstration. Whatever your opinion of that particular incident, it highlights a broader issue, which is a lack of open public debate about the thousands of statues installed in community spaces across the country. Should the citizens who live and use those public areas not be part of a discussion regarding the artworks selected for display? If the vast majority find an existing sculpture objectionable, why should they be subjected to its presence every day?Maybe, there's a good reason for a statue to remain. Fine. Let its merits be debated, and a democratic decision made on a way forward. Perhaps it could be re-sited, or contextual material added, or, in some cases, put in storage and the space used for an alternative artwork agreed by the local community. Any which way, give the people a say: who or what do they want to commemorate or celebrate?But, unlike Madame Tussauds, there is no overarching national strategic approach to the display of statues in public places. There is the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association, but it has no official mandate to make curatorial choices or impose policy. The decision is usually left with local councils, some of which have truly awful taste. Or, worse, are deaf to the community they represent.  Perhaps there should be an authorised body overseeing a coherent policy for sculpture in the public realm: a body consisting of experts that could constantly review the works exhibited just as the curators in a museum do for the objects for which they are responsible.  This informed, dedicated body could also be a place for debate, commissioning, programming, and exchange. Sculpture in the public realm could be treated like another national museum, with a director, specialist curators, conservators, and - most importantly - an education department that could collaborate with the local community and schools.It could provide more than a platform for discussions about what individual statues should and should not be shown, but also the chance to develop an exhibition plan in consultation with each area that would aim to enhance public spaces for the local population. The toppling of Colston's effigy could be the catalyst for a new community-focussed approach. As towns such as Harlow in Essex have shown, with its commitment to British modern sculptors such as Elisabeth Frink and Barbara Hepworth, a serious, planned approach to the exhibiting of outdoor artworks can not only enhance the space in which they sit, but also the area as a whole - giving it an identity and a cohesion: a reason for people to live there and a reason for people to visit. There is an opportunity to recast our approach to public sculpture, to transform the current hit-and-miss, generally unaccountable system, into a mould-breaking, country-spanning, new national Museum of Art in the Public Realm.

Coronavirus: Report suggests arts industry faces 'ruinous losses',"A cut in public funding has left the arts sector more exposed to the threat of Covid-19, new figures suggest.The latest Arts Index, published annually, showed public investment in arts per head of the population fell by 35% in the last decade.However, earned income by arts organisations from things like box office ticket sales increased by 47%. The government said it was working with the arts sector directly on how to reopen safely and plan for the future.The Arts Index is published by The National Campaign for the Arts (NCA), and acts as a snapshot report of the health of England's arts and culture.It is published in partnership with the Creative Industries Federation and King's College London and compares year-on-year figures using 20 key indicators.The latest index, published on Monday, puts the recent figures in the context of the last decade, which saw a UK recession prompt a shift in the income streams for arts organisations.While galleries and cinemas are putting plans in place to reopen, theatres and concert venues will remain closed for the foreseeable future. The chair of the NCA, Samuel West, said: ""Arts organisations rose to the challenge following the financial crash; we salute them for increasing earned income in response to a triple whammy of cuts to public funding, business sponsorship and philanthropic giving.  ""It's bitterly ironic that the arts sector's resourceful response to the 2008 financial crash is now the very thing that makes it vulnerable to the COVID-19 crisis, with theatres closed and income from tickets and bars dropping off a cliff.""The NCA said the sector had been ""brought to its knees"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding that many companies now face ""ruinous losses"".A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told BBC News: ""The government has announced unprecedented financial aid for the arts and cultural sectors, including the Self Employed Support Scheme, the job retention scheme, a year's business rates holiday, and the Arts Council's £160 million emergency response package. ""We want to help those organisations that have worked hard to become a commercial success, and we are working directly with the arts sector on how it can reopen safely and plan for the future.""In October, DCMS announced £250m of funding for the cultural and creative sector - the biggest one-off government investment in cultural infrastructure, local museums and neighbourhood libraries in the last century.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told The Evening Standard on Monday: ""I am not going to stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed... Of course I want to get the money flowing, I am not going to let anyone down.""Discussing his negotiations with the treasury about further financial aid, he said: ""Not everyone is going to be happy with whatever comes up. I'm going to have to ask institutions to take difficult decisions"".The latest index notes that the West End weathered the financial storm that started in 2008 particularly well, and since 2013 the sector saw real terms growth in revenues practically every year to 2018.It also states that financial support from arts trusts and foundations jumped by 38% between 2014 and 2018.However, the index showed the proportion of all GCSEs being taken in creative subjects is down 20% since 2010.",8 June 2020,entertainment
Sitting In Limbo: Brother turns Windrush scandal into a very personal TV drama,"Anthony Bryan had lived and worked in Britain for 50 years when he was suddenly detained and almost deported. His brother has now told his story in a feature-length TV drama that brings home the impact of the Windrush scandal. Anthony Bryan's story has been told in newspaper articles and a TV documentary and at a damning House of Commons hearing - but a TV drama has the power to really plunge you into a person's life.In BBC One's Sitting In Limbo, we follow Bryan, a painter-decorator who had never been in trouble with the law, as he is told he can no longer work, before being arrested in his London home, detained for five weeks and booked on a plane to Jamaica, a country he hadn't visited since 1965, when he was eight.Patrick Robinson, who plays Bryan, says: ""When I read the script, I was in tears easily halfway through and blubbing at the end, knowing that I wanted to be involved in this piece, because it made me feel."" Bryan was one of many people to be caught up in the Windrush scandal - people who had moved from the Caribbean to the UK, mostly as children, and became collateral damage as the government created a ""hostile environment"" towards immigration.The government has said more than 160 people may have been wrongly detained or deported. More than 1,270 claims have been made to a compensation scheme. An independent review found there was a ""profound institutional failure"" which turned thousands of people's lives upside down, and Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""on behalf of this and successive governments I am truly sorry for the actions that span decades"".""It broke me,"" Bryan said of the ordeal in a 2019 BBC documentary, which is being repeated five days after the drama.His younger brother, novelist Stephen S Thompson, used his first-hand insight to write the script for Sitting In Limbo.He originally heard about the arrest from Bryan's partner Janet. ""My first thought was, that's a bit strange because I've never known him to be in trouble with the police,"" Thompson says. ""And then she mentioned the word 'immigration'. And that made it even more strange.""First it was shock, then horror, and then like, OK, how do we become practical about this? How are we going to get him out?""Bryan had to prove he really had arrived in the 60s and been in the UK ever since. The Home Office thought he was lying, he told MPs in 2018.He was detained twice and feared he would next see his family when they visited him in Jamaica. Only a last-minute intervention by an immigration lawyer in 2017 prevented his deportation.Bryan was ""very stoic"" throughout, Thompson says. ""Obviously, he's been traumatised by it. He couldn't quite believe it, like all of us.""He gets to that point where he thinks, OK, well, it must be a mistake. He has quite a lot of faith in - or he had quite a lot of faith in - the system in this country, in this idea of fair play.""He refuses even till this day to feel embittered, or to take it too personally or to see it as fundamentally an issue of race.""Even so, the current backdrop of protests about systemic racism in the UK as well as the US is likely to give Monday's broadcast added potency.""Initially, I think he was disappointed and hurt and felt like he was being treated like a criminal by his own country when he'd done nothing wrong,"" Thompson continues.""That sense of disappointment is probably the underlying emotion. How could this country that he believed in so much let him down so badly?""Bryan was heavily involved when Thompson was working on the script. The writer had to ask his brother and Janet to open up about the emotions they went through at the time.""It's not easy to dredge that stuff up again,"" Thompson says, adding that the softly-spoken Bryan is naturally ""quite private"".""But without that emotional content, it just wouldn't be the same. So that was the most difficult thing for me because they had to relive it, or at least talk about it in a very explicit way, whereas like I said, they're not really those types.""So even though he's my brother, I guess we kind of had to build that trust as we went along.""Patrick Robinson, who's best known for playing Ash in the BBC's Casualty, remembers being ""outraged"" when the scandal broke in 2017.It wasn't news to him, however - a friend's brother, who had been in the UK since he was five months old, was not allowed to come back after a trip to Jamaica, meaning he missed his mother's funeral.""When you hear more about it, you just think, that could be me or my brother,"" Robinson says. ""So yes, it's outrageous and sadly par for the course to do with bureaucracy and government, especially the British government.""Robinson's own parents came from Jamaica to Britain in the late 1950s or early 60s. He was born in the UK, but older siblings had travelled with their mother and father.He learned a lot about the history of Caribbean immigration to the UK when narrating a documentary about the Windrush generation in the late 1990s.For instance, he learned that Conservative Health Minister Enoch Powell - later notorious for his ""rivers of blood"" speech - recruited women from the British Empire to work as nurses in the NHS in the early 60s.""They got invited here, and that's what's missing for me in terms of the narrative that people don't really know,"" Robinson says.The actor got to know the real Anthony Bryan ""a little bit"" during the course of filming.""He's a very cool guy,"" he says. ""He's pretty dignified and that's how he was, I believe, throughout the whole experience that he had.""The drama includes scenes of Bryan with friends in a local club in Tottenham. Before meeting Bryan, Robinson's research involved going under cover to ""shadow"" him one night.""I just slipped in there and watched him for an hour before I made myself known to him in the club. That was great. And he was very loved, genuinely, as I watched people come up to him and hang out and chat.""Despite the extensive reporting of the Windrush scandal - not least when it led to Home Secretary Amber Rudd's resignation in 2018 - Robinson thinks the TV drama can give viewers a new insight into the personal toll.""I hope that it will make people think. You hope they're entertained. You hope they feel,"" he says.""In order to try to understand other people, you just have to imagine yourself in their shoes. And what the film can do is put you there.""Sitting in Limbo is on BBC One at 20:30 BST on Monday, and then on BBC iPlayer. The Unwanted: The Secret Windrush Files is on BBC Two at 20:15 on 13 June, and then on iPlayer.",5 June 2020,entertainment
Meet Gracey: The pop star who lost her voice as her career took off,"Pop singer Gracey had always had a rasp in her voice - a distinctive, leonine quality that brought her songs of heartache and unrequited love to vivid life.But then something went wrong.This time last year, she was in Los Angeles writing new music when her larynx locked up.""I didn't speak the entire trip unless I was in a writing session and I still lost my voice,"" says the 22-year-old.""I remember being with my manager at breakfast, and nothing she could say could make it better. And I just cried my eyes out because I was like, 'I'm gonna have to get surgery.'""The Brighton-born singer, whose full name is Grace Barker, was quickly diagnosed with vocal nodules - small hard growths on the vocal cords - and went under the surgeon's knife.For the next two months she was forbidden from speaking and singing. For a natural chatterbox, it was an intensely uncomfortable experience. ""I mean, I was such a mess,"" she says. ""I'm someone that would just talk for days - but imagine if you're at the dinner table and everyone's cracking jokes and you can't join in because you're trying to write out a joke on your whiteboard - and then you're dyslexic, so no-one can read it.""So I think I was just freaked out. I was not myself for those months at all.""Weighing on her mind was the fact that, just weeks before undergoing surgery, Gracey had released her debut single Different Things. Instead of capitalising on the buzz, she was now moving back into her parents' house ""so my mum could look after me in my childhood bedroom"".Luckily, the single did the talking for her.  A deliciously miserable pop ballad, it treads the same water as Imogen Heap's Hide And Seek - with Gracey's voice fed through a vocoder to emphasise the growing distance between her and her lover.""We want different things,"" sighs the singer. ""I just wanted to love you - but you made it [expletive] hard to.""Warning: This song contains explicit language.Released last March, the song ended up on several end-of-year lists - not bad for a song that was initially dashed off as a demo for Little Mix.""They were looking for songs, so we wrote it as a pitch and it started quite upbeat,"" recalls Gracey. ""I'd written the chorus quite quickly and sometimes, just to check the lyrics will fit, you'll slow it down and sing it over a piano. So we did that and instantly the vibe changed. ""From then, the lyrics kind of just poured out of me - everything I hadn't said to myself in years and years just came out.""Based on one of her first teenage relationships (""I just didn't really know what I wanted"") the song was obviously too personal, and too downbeat, to give to Britain's premier girl band, so Gracey held it back for herself.Releasing it last March fulfilled an ambition that originally surfaced at the age of seven, when she wrote a song called Pinky Finger.""One of my best friends can still recite it,"" she laughs. ""It goes 'Pinky finger with a cherry on top / Smile together and never, ever stop.'"" (the melody, to be fair, wouldn't sound out of place on an S Club 7 single). At the time, Grace's family were living in Haywards Heath, ""a standard little town in the south,"" and while her two older brothers were both academic, she was ""intelligent in a different way - in the words of my mother"".It wasn't until she turned 16 that she learned she was dyslexic. Until then, she'd assumed her inability to finish exams was due to a lack of preparation. But in some respects, she says, the condition helped to shape her musical abilities.""I think, weirdly, it pushed me to be more creative because I had to do things in different ways. Like, if I was reading books when I was younger, I'd just make up the story from the pictures.""Although she idolised Gwen Stefani and Katy Perry, she couldn't envision herself as a pop star - so when she won a place at London's prestigious Brit School, she chose to study musical theatre instead of popular music.""I just didn't think music was ever going to be an option,"" she says, ""but also, I didn't like the idea of having music homework because music was my thing.""So while she was cast as a succession of ""drunk old women"" in school productions, she was secretly demo-ing pop songs into her phone in the bathroom at home.""I didn't have enough storage for a full song,"" she recalls, ""so I'd just upload little clips and half songs to Soundcloud."" Through that, she was spotted by songwriter Brian Higgins (Cher, Pet Shop Boys, Girls Aloud) who invited her to join his team of writers at the hit production house Xenomania, at the age of 16.""Actually, I initially auditioned for a girl band,"" she says, ""but I decided I didn't want to do that, so I said, 'I'll happily come in as a writer.'""I didn't do any lyrics because I don't think they trusted a dyslexic 16-year-old who was going through her GCSEs to do the lyrics - but it really gave me a good time to hone in on my melodies. Even now, I find them I'm so much quicker at melodies than anything else. I learned a lot.""She got so good at it that Gracey became a writer-for-hire, with her first professionally-recorded song, Jonas Blue's By Your Side, going platinum. She later penned hits for Rita Ora, Raye and Olly Murs before Different Things opened a new chapter.Which brings us back to those two months of enforced silence. ""I was in a bad place,"" the singer reflects. ""I was like, 'I just cannot have a career like this.'""Her team was worried, too - not about Gracey's voice, for which the prognosis was good, but about killing the momentum of Different Things. There was pressure, she admits, to post about her surgery on social media. ""They responded so well and so calmly but they were very much like, 'You should share this... We can't have a two to three month break without releasing music,'"" she recalls.""They were panicking, basically, and as much as I could sympathise with that panic, I was just too scared that I'd never be able to sing again. ""So I was like, 'I need to look after my mental health instead of pretending I'm happy on social media.'""That scenario inspired a lyric in Gracey's new song, Empty Love. ""Can you stop asking me to smile, please?"" she pleads over a sparse digital beat. ""Gotta have the time of our lives all the time, don't we?""Warning: This song contains explicit language.A duet with Australian pop star Ruel, the song is more concerned with the dangers of performative happiness on social media.It's a topic Gracey wrestles with: She recognises that only posting on her good days builds up a false impression, but is instinctively wary of over-sharing.""I hate pity, so it's a double-edged sword,"" she says. ""I feel like a drama queen when I say I'm having a bad day on Twitter and all these lovely people message back, 'No, you're great. You're loved'.  ""I'm just like, 'Oh, no, no, no I'm not trying to make you compliment me!' ""But I think sometimes it's important to vent and, you know, shampoo and condition your brain out.""Even so, music will always be the main outlet for Gracey's emotions.""Whenever I've been through a break-up in the past, I'll only talk to my friends about it as many times as I think I won't annoy them,"" she says. ""So I kind of push everything down and then, when I'm in the studio, it just comes out, which I think is why a lot of my songs are sad.""Two of those songs - Alone In My Room (Gone) and Don't Need Love (Swipe Left, Swipe Right) - have both gone viral on TikTok, proving that Gracey doesn't need to write long confessional posts on Instagram to help fans realise they're not alone in their feelings.But does she realise that people are playing these songs on repeat, in floods of tears, while they pore over photos of their ex?""Yeah, and do you know what? I feel kind of bad about it,"" she laughs.""But I also think getting it out in the open is the best way to move on. Go out and pretend you're fine to the guy, for sure, but also go home and cry. ""If you're gonna pretend, at least don't pretend to yourself. I think that's the key.""Empty Love is out now.",7 June 2020,entertainment
Tim Davie's hellish new job as BBC director general,"The BBC's new director general is a global deal-maker facing a daunting set of challenges. Alas for him, many of the forces that will determine his legacy are beyond his control.Tim Davie has landed one of the most privileged jobs in Britain and global media, leading thousands of creative people at a remarkable moment in history.Aside from that, it's hell.Always the front-runner, he has taken a significant pay cut to have the fight of his life. In this blog, based on recent conversations with over a dozen senior figures in the media industry within the BBC and beyond, I will give a summary of just some of the challenges he faces.Before that, a few words on him, his credentials, and - crucially - the forces beyond his control.Davie is a commercial creature with a genuinely global perspective. A detailed analysis of recent BBC annual reports will show he was an effective revenue raiser at BBC Studios, the commercial wing of the BBC. Its job is to make deals with distributors. Davie is becoming director general (DG) after several years of deal-making around the world. Making a deal with No 10 is now his most important task.And this commercial and global experience is in marked contrast to the three most recent director generals, much of whose relevant experience at the BBC was in the News division. Davie does have experience of editorial leadership, from his time running the Audio and Music services.Talking of which, several former BBC executives championed Davie because of the commitment to collective responsibility he showed when the decision was made to scrap BBC 6 Music in 2010. I am told he was privately against the decision, but fronted it publicly, taking a lot of heat for a move he disagreed with. The decision was eventually reversed by then-DG Mark Thompson.Similarly, when the BBC was in a deep crisis after the departure of George Entwistle in 2012, as acting DG, Davie walked the newsroom floor and showed visible leadership. Staff I have spoken to on the shop floor today appreciated that.He is a sports nut with three children. He runs marathons, supports Crystal Palace, and has more than once answered the phone with ""I'm just listening to the football, what's happening?"" He also has a cultural hinterland, having been chairman of Comic Relief and the Creative Industries Council, and on the board of the Tate.He was the first in his family to go to university, and earned a scholarship to Whitgift School in Croydon. Aside from turning down the chance to run the Premier League, he has been approached in recent years by tech companies who wanted to poach him.A common mistake in appreciations of any institutional leaders' legacy is to condemn them for failing to defeat forces that were in fact beyond their control. Most DGs' legacies and reputations are dominated by how they responded to challenges they couldn't possibly have foreseen when they got the job. These might include an error broadcast at 6.17am on the Today programme, a prank call made by a famous presenter, or revelations around the sordid history of someone like Jimmy Savile.It's important at an early stage to be clear about what Tim Davie can't control. He can't control the fact that the BBC no longer has anything like a dominant position in entertainment or sport. He can't control the fact that the most powerful companies in human history are competing with the BBC for eyeballs and attention. He can't control the fact that young people will increasingly be tempted to spend time with the products of those companies.He can't control the fact that upholding levels of trust and a reputation for impartiality earned over a century is much, much harder in the age of social media. He can't control the fact that lies and conspiracy theories about him and the BBC will circulate every minute on social media. Greg Dyke had to worry about a lot, including what happened at 6.17am on the Today programme, but he didn't have to worry about that.Effective leadership recognises the limits of power. It also recognises the vitality of key relationships. Davie can't control the most important appointment of his tenure, which is the likely replacement of Sir David Clementi as BBC chairman next February. His successor will be chosen by the government. In idle moments I have wondered - because that's what media editors do - if one name that No 10 might consider is David Cameron. I have no evidence of any interest he may have in the role, or any discussion of it. It's just a thought.Recent chairmen of the BBC, from Chris Patten to Christopher Bland, have been associated with Conservative circles. Cameron's only job outside politics was working for Michael Green of Carlton, a television firm. The BBC is one expression of the Big Society. And the biggest challenge facing Davie is his coming political negotiation with a No 10 operation that, before the pandemic, told Tim Shipman of The Sunday Times it would ""whack"" the BBC. The headline on that article was ""No 10 tells BBC licence fee will be scrapped"". So decent connections to the current government may prove handy.Then again, Cameron did once call Dominic Cummings ""a career psychopath"".Aside from all the forces, and appointments, beyond his control, Davie's inbox is daunting. Here are just some of the challenges he will confront.Davie, who was a minor local Conservative official in the 1990s, hasn't been active in politics for over two decades. He's about to become very active. In 2022, when the BBC celebrates its centenary, he will lead a negotiation with No 10 over the licence fee from 2027. This will be nasty, brutish and long. Often it will be played out in public. Davie needs to be prepared to resign - as Mark Thompson once threatened to - if he thinks the BBC is getting a bad deal. A threat of resignation will be ineffective unless he is prepared to follow it through. At just 53, and having by then a couple of years under his belt in the job, he knows that if he did leave he could get a job elsewhere fast (and almost certainly better paid). How should the BBC be funded in the year 2027? This is a very complex question with moral, technical and political elements. Presumably his stance in negotiations with No 10 will be to ask just how ambitious the government wants to be for the BBC. A persuasive argument might run something like this:This is the Asian Century. Britain is (and you can be subtle about this point) a declining power, in relative terms at least. What have you/we got that allows us to punch above our weight? Answer (aside from our universities, scientists, etc) - the English language, great heritage brands, and phenomenally talented and creative people. Which institution best aligns those? The BBC. So unleash us, prime minister, to be a global force, not just in the market, but with the unique contract with the public which the licence fee represents.But that's where it gets complicated. To turn the BBC from a £5bn organisation into one that can compete with Disney, Netflix, Apple and Amazon means raising money. That means commercial activity. But each commercial salvo made by the BBC has an impact on rivals who don't have recourse to the licence fee. This prompts them to lobby government, and often shapes regulation. The other issue is that the BBC currently benefits from huge economies of scale. Move to a different model, including with a direct-to-consumer offer to international audiences, and some of those efficiencies can be lost.Davie knows there are two trend lines that are hurting the corporation. The first is the cost of making programming around the world, which is hyper-inflationary. To cap the BBC's income is to make it, in relative terms, smaller and smaller in this new landscape.The second trend line is the diminishing attachment of young audiences to BBC content. This can't be helped. Blame the internet. But income from young people, as licence fee payers, is vital; and if they disappear, then so too do the BBC's claims to universality, of giving something to everyone. This is the argument against a subscription model, which by definition caters to subscribers.How, then, should the BBC be funded in 2027, to compete with tech giants and persuade young people to part with cash? Davie needs a very strong answer.Ultimately, the BBC is judged on the quality of its output. This requires hiring the best and most creative people in the world (the terrible industry phrase for this, ""talent"", overlooks the importance of people who aren't on air). Making great programmes that cut through in a golden age of audio and television is very hard. Especially when other people come along and poach your best people. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is one of the most exciting actors and writers in the world today. Her breakthrough shows were on the BBC. She might spend the bulk of her career at the BBC. But right now, Amazon has bought her time. The promise of being on the BBC, with its prestige and big audiences, is valuable; but rivals are energised, and there's nothing Davie can do about that. The coronavirus pandemic has shown demand for the BBC's news operation remains huge. That is partly a verdict on public interest in the story; but it's also a verdict on what BBC News staff have done day in, day out for years. Nevertheless, trust, like all social goods, is easily destroyed, and not easily generated. For BBC News, impartiality and accuracy are the two keys. Both are much harder in the age of social media. Richard Sambrook, a respected former BBC executive now at Cardiff University, is conducting a review of how social media is affecting the impartiality of the BBC. That may have value, but the much, much bigger issue is the effect social media is having on accuracy. In journalism, accuracy is foundational and sacred. Without accuracy, debates about impartiality are otiose. Under the current royal charter, the DG is both chief executive and editor-in-chief. Dauntingly for him, Davie is now responsible for the accuracy of all BBC output. The BBC needs to reflect Britain as best as possible. That means cognitive diversity as much as other, more often discussed types of diversity. Tim Davie is privately educated (albeit on a scholarship), an Oxbridge arts graduate, and lives in the south-east.He has led many of the BBC's efforts to improve its ethnic minority diversity. He will inherit from Tony Hall a pay structure reformed in the aftermath of the outcry over equal pay. The BBC has made progress on the gender pay gap across the organisation. Many outstanding cases of equal pay for equal work need to be resolved, and could yet generate damaging headlines.But there's more to diversity than immediately visible classifications. Four urgent areas that need attention are the number of non-metropolitan staff (those who live in rural communities or small towns); the number of non-graduates; the proportion of staff who are from a science background rather than the arts and humanities; and the domination of London.On the first of these, Davie has the advantage of being proudly suburban. On the last, Lord Hall has made significant progress in boosting BBC operations in Salford, Glasgow and elsewhere. On all of them, Davie has a solution readily available: the deeply rooted network of local staff around the country who are plugged into their communities, and look and sound like them. Massively ramping up the flow of producers and editors from local BBC services to the national headquarters is an easy potential win.Many big executive jobs at the BBC are an invitation to hell, granted with all good wishes from the staff and public. Tony Hall had the hardest job of any DG in the BBC's history. Tim Davie's will be much harder.Welcome, boss.If you're interested in issues such as these, please follow me on Twitter or Facebook; and also please subscribe to The Media Show podcast from Radio 4.

Coronavirus: £2.5m musicians' fund runs out of cash,"A £2.5m fund set up to help musicians during the coronavirus crisis is set to run out of cash after just five days.More than 3,500 people have applied for financial assistance since Friday, says the charity Help Musicians UK.But with the fund reaching capacity, and live music a distant prospect, other applicants may be left stranded.""It's a bigger, longer crisis than any of us could have thought possible,"" said the charity's chief executive, Jack Ainscough.Touring and gigging musicians have been particularly affected by the lockdown, as months of work simply vanished in mid-March.Many of them (up to 25%) are not covered by the government's scheme to support freelancers, and have no other source of income during the lockdown.The current Help Musicians fund is targeted at those self-employed workers, following a first phase in March that offered one-off grants of £500 to any musician facing immediate financial difficulties. That scheme handed out over £8m to nearly 17,000 musicians in just four weeks, including The Waterboys' drummer Ralph Salmins.""My work is not coming back till March or April next year,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't know what I'm going to do.""The musician, who has performed or recorded with Paul McCartney, Bjork, Aretha Franklin and Madonna, as well as appearing on more than 150 film soundtracks, said the industry could be facing ""a two-year lull"" before returning to normal.""We're really, really in a corner in the arts and I don't think, unfortunately, the government has quite cottoned on to it,"" he said.""It's really grisly. It's very, very dire.""A study conducted by Help Musicians found that 99% of musicians had worried about their financial situation during lockdown, while 46% said the impact on their wellbeing had been ""strong or severe"".""One of the points for us, is that financial hardship funding isn't just about financial hardship,"" Mr Ainscough explained. ""It's actually about reducing anxiety, which reduces the likelihood of tripping into more serious mental health issues. ""It's about stopping someone becoming homeless, stopping somebody from having to go couch-surfing, and keeping them in a state where actually they've got a hope of remaining creative.""He added that, while most people think of musicians as being Stormzy or Dua Lipa, the vast majority live a much more meagre existence.""After the first round of grants, one lady wrote back to me and said, 'I've never been more excited to pay my rent,'"" Mr Ainscough recalled.Help Musicians, along with the Musicians Union, is calling on the government to provide extra help to freelancers in the arts who are suffering financial difficulties.""This is a much longer-term problem than for other sectors of the economy, which can open up now,"" said Mr Ainscough.The charity is also seeking donations to top up the fund - which was initially drawn from its own reserves, combined with £500,000 from music rights organisation PPL and £50,000 from Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol.Another supporter is Squeeze's Chris Difford, who held an online fund-raiser for the charity last week. ""I got involved because a friend of mine, who suffers from depression, is a fabulous writer and found themselves without any money and without anywhere to go. ""He turned to Help Musicians and he got a grant, and he was really buoyed up by the support,"" he told the BBC. ""So I was impressed by what I saw.""Difford, whose hits include Tempted, Up The Junction and Cool For Cats, added that, like many musicians, touring had been his main source of income for the past 15 years - but he couldn't see concerts resuming soon.""I'd love live music to come back as soon as possible but I just don't know where the confidence is going to come from,"" he said.""If somebody said to me, 'You've got an American tour in three months' time,' I would definitely have to sort of take a very deep breath about it and think it through.""",9 June 2020,entertainment
Hollyoaks launches investigation after Rachel Adedeji racism claims,"Hollyoaks has launched an investigation after Rachel Adedeji alleged she witnessed racism on the soap.The actress said a senior producer referred to black cast members using a racial slur and claimed black actresses were told to change their hair.A statement posted on the show's Instagram page said: ""Hollyoaks has zero tolerance on racism.""We are taking Rachel Adedeji's comments extremely seriously and are investigating."" On Saturday, Adedeji tweeted several claims about her experiences on the Channel 4 soap, which is produced by Lime Pictures.The actress said she was told ""You're all the same"" by a make-up artist, and said black actresses on the show were ""forced to drastically change their hair"" after being told viewers wouldn't be able to tell them apart. Adedeji, has appeared in more than 200 episodes of the show, but said in her four years on the soap she had only worked with one black director.""Working at Hollyoaks is mostly positive, but the experiences I have encountered are a constant reminder of how difficult it is being a black woman in the industry,"" Adedeji said. ""I am no longer standing for it.""Her comments follow the Black Lives Matter protests, which were sparked by the death of George Floyd in police custody.Former Hollyoaks star Amanda Clapham supported Adedeji on Twitter, saying she witnessed ""micro-aggressions"" towards BAME staff on the show.Clapham alleged one male black cast member was ""disproportionately told off"" for talking and messing around during filming, when a whole group of actors had been involved.Andrea Ali, who plays Celeste Faroe, supported Adedeji but praised the soap's efforts on representation.""I am beyond blessed to be a part of a team as diverse and as inclusive as Hollyoaks,"" Ali said.""Celeste Faroe is a powerhouse and that representation of black women is not only one that I am proud of, but one that matters.""Last week, Hollyoaks announced it would address the Black Lives Matter movement by recording a series of special podcasts about racism.At the time, actress Kéllé Bryan said: ""We've been busy behind the scenes having lots of highly important conversations and we'll be kick-starting with a podcast all about racism - how we tackle it, how we face it and, most importantly, how we overcome it.""But in her statement, Adedeji said: ""Putting out a podcast and asking your black cast members to teach you how to tackle these issues is the bare minimum. Do better.""On Monday's Loose Women, Bryan addressed the backlash she'd received from the podcast announcement, but said there was no bad blood between herself and Adedeji.""Myself and Rachel have spoken and we have shared our feelings... I'm supporting her and she's reached out to me also. We'll just work through this, hopefully, internally.""She meant no harm in her post in terms of me personally.""In a statement to the ITV daytime show, Hollyoaks said: ""Lime Pictures has a zero tolerance approach to racism, in line with our commitment to do the right thing, we will review the matters that have been reported.""The BBC has contacted Lime Pictures for further comment.Hollyoaks is set to resume production in Liverpool this week, with the cast expected back on set in July.Adedeji first shot to fame as an X Factor finalist in 2009, finishing in ninth place.

Coronavirus: Report suggests arts industry faces 'ruinous losses',"A cut in public funding has left the arts sector more exposed to the threat of Covid-19, new figures suggest.The latest Arts Index, published annually, showed public investment in arts per head of the population fell by 35% in the last decade.However, earned income by arts organisations from things like box office ticket sales increased by 47%. The government said it was working with the arts sector directly on how to reopen safely and plan for the future.The Arts Index is published by The National Campaign for the Arts (NCA), and acts as a snapshot report of the health of England's arts and culture.It is published in partnership with the Creative Industries Federation and King's College London and compares year-on-year figures using 20 key indicators.The latest index, published on Monday, puts the recent figures in the context of the last decade, which saw a UK recession prompt a shift in the income streams for arts organisations.While galleries and cinemas are putting plans in place to reopen, theatres and concert venues will remain closed for the foreseeable future. The chair of the NCA, Samuel West, said: ""Arts organisations rose to the challenge following the financial crash; we salute them for increasing earned income in response to a triple whammy of cuts to public funding, business sponsorship and philanthropic giving.  ""It's bitterly ironic that the arts sector's resourceful response to the 2008 financial crash is now the very thing that makes it vulnerable to the COVID-19 crisis, with theatres closed and income from tickets and bars dropping off a cliff.""The NCA said the sector had been ""brought to its knees"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, adding that many companies now face ""ruinous losses"".A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told BBC News: ""The government has announced unprecedented financial aid for the arts and cultural sectors, including the Self Employed Support Scheme, the job retention scheme, a year's business rates holiday, and the Arts Council's £160 million emergency response package. ""We want to help those organisations that have worked hard to become a commercial success, and we are working directly with the arts sector on how it can reopen safely and plan for the future.""In October, DCMS announced £250m of funding for the cultural and creative sector - the biggest one-off government investment in cultural infrastructure, local museums and neighbourhood libraries in the last century.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told The Evening Standard on Monday: ""I am not going to stand by and see our world-leading position in arts and culture destroyed... Of course I want to get the money flowing, I am not going to let anyone down.""Discussing his negotiations with the treasury about further financial aid, he said: ""Not everyone is going to be happy with whatever comes up. I'm going to have to ask institutions to take difficult decisions"".The latest index notes that the West End weathered the financial storm that started in 2008 particularly well, and since 2013 the sector saw real terms growth in revenues practically every year to 2018.It also states that financial support from arts trusts and foundations jumped by 38% between 2014 and 2018.However, the index showed the proportion of all GCSEs being taken in creative subjects is down 20% since 2010.",8 June 2020,entertainment
