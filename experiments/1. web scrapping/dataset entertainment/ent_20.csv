What journalist-haters get wrong,"Across the world today, journalists are under sustained attack.We know a lot more about it, as we know about the death of George Floyd, because of smartphones. When I say attack, I don't mean the broad ways in which their trade has been undermined, or their daily lives made more difficult, for example by the digital destruction of many traditional business models. When I say attack, I mean punched, beaten, bloodied and killed. For doing their job.Jamal Khashoggi is one of the most high-profile victims of recent years, murdered and mutilated for having the temerity to point out, on more than one occasion, that the House of Saud has not been a historic champion of universal human rights.Further back, but still very much within living memory, Anna Politkovskaya was killed for daring to get close to the truth about the modern Russian state, not least its activities in Chechnya.Just this week, we have seen a grim escalation, as protests and riots in response to Floyd's killing tear at the fabric of America. The attacks on journalists have been led by the US President, who has regularly cast them as ""enemy of the people"".On Saturday night, police in Minneapolis shot rubber bullets at two members of a Reuters crew in Minneapolis. Cameraman Julio-Cesar Chavez said: ""A police officer that I'm filming turns around and points his rubber-bullet rifle straight at me.""Radio reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez took a rubber bullet to his throat.Yesterday, live on Australian television, a cameraman was punched near the White House.  Footage from a different angle clearly shows he displayed no aggression toward the police officer who used the edge of a police shield to hit the cameraman's stomach before punching the lens.A few days ago, my very distinguished colleague Pete Murtaugh was charged at by police officers, not far from the White House. The BBC's Paul Danahar, who runs the BBC News' bureaux across the Americas, was right to say that Peter was ""clearly identifiable as a member of the media"". The camera is always a giveaway, you see.Danahar went on: ""The team had been following all directions from the police as they covered the protests in front of the White House. The assault took place even before the curfew had been imposed, and happened without warning or provocation.""It must be exceptionally tough for police officers trying to uphold law and order. That said, in each of the cases I have mentioned, the journalist was probably identifiable as a member of the media.And as for Pete Murtaugh, you've never heard of him, have you? Well, here's your moment. He's a father of three, universally adored in the BBC's Washington bureau, and widely regarded as one of the outstanding news cameramen of his generation. He lives just outside the city, and is an exceptionally kind and smart bloke.    A few years ago, when I door-stepped Rupert Murdoch outside his office in New York, a lot of people got in touch to say well done (often from within his company, as it happens). But the credit wasn't mine. It was almost all Pete's. I had been looking the other way, facing the camera, when eagle-eyed Pete looked in the distance and saw him coming out of the office. He shouted, ""It's Murdoch!"". For some reason, despite being in New York specifically to cover a story about Rupert Murdoch, something about Pete's accent, and my misspent youth, made me think, 'Why has he suddenly brought up the A Team?'. But that's a story for another day.Between them, Pete and my magnificent producer colleague Elizabeth Needham-Bennett, got us in position to ask the questions.       I had the easiest job of the lot, saying mere words. Look at the clip of that moment: you can clearly see Pete's reflection in Murdoch's car window. My job was to articulate a few sentences. Pete's job was infinitely harder: running with a very heavy camera on his shoulder; adjusting the focus and light exposure; and constantly and instantly responding to my movements and that of Murdoch's driver and security personnel - while keeping the shot tight.Most people could ask Rupert Murdoch some questions on a Manhattan Street. How many could do what Pete Murtaugh did that day, let alone as well as he did? One in 10,000?It's a skill, and that's why we call it a trade, and camera men and women are as much part of the trade as reporters are. In fact, to my mind, they're more important. If you're lucky in news broadcasting, you get to work in teams of three: reporter, producer, camera operator. The reporter is the one who often gets the credit, and is always the best paid. But if the reporter wasn't there, and the camera operator was, you'd still have pictures for the news. Whereas if the camera man or woman wasn't there, you'd have nothing. The single biggest and most frequent mistake made by those currently attacking journalists as enemies of the people is the tendency to react emotionally to some provocation by a high-profile journalist by impugning the whole trade. It's as if, in the minds of these journalist-haters, one famous anchor is by default an ambassador for the millions of people who work in the trade around the world. This is how fame distorts. It gives a false picture to many people of what - and, crucially, who - constitutes journalism. Naturally, President Trump isn't representative of public opinion, but you can see him make this conflation often. When he didn't like a line of questioning by CNN's Jim Acosta, he would attack him - and then by extension CNN.When he didn't like a line of questioning by NBC's Peter Alexander, he didn't just attack Alexander, but NBC and Comcast, which owns it.You see this in many of the attacks against the BBC. Of course, a huge number of criticisms of the BBC are entirely valid and necessary. Moreover, modern media has countless failings, many of them accentuated in recent years by social media. That's why the media these days is so often the story itself.But the species of criticism which begins from disapproval of what one well-paid, high-profile figure says on a particular occasion, to eviscerate the whole organisation, as if that one person represents more than 20,000 others, is sloppy.Journalism, as I have said elsewhere, is a noble trade whose higher callings are to inform the citizenry, apply scrutiny to power, and enlighten a culture, by spreading ideas and ideals. Cameramen and women, and producers and sub-editors and fact-checkers, all contribute to this effort. Most of them are not famous. In fact, most people in journalism - though obviously not all - are decent, civilised, public-spirited people who enjoy elegant sentences, could get paid better elsewhere, and are in it more to scratch an itch for information than adulation.They are local reporters knocking on doors to make sure silenced voices are heard, or sitting in tedious council meetings to ensure bureaucrats don't get away with deceit, or fixing interviews with people who want to contribute to a phone-in. In their small way, all these courses of human action fortify the collective effort of the trade.What, after all, are camera operators who chronicle the unrest in America today doing, if not informing the citizenry, and so helping to apply scrutiny to power? The work is vital, the danger growing; and the reward often smaller than you think, financially at least. They also, I can report, have a preference not to be targeted by democratically elected leaders - or punched in the face.

Stars back John Boyega after Black Lives Matter protest,"Stars including JK Rowling and Jordan Peele have praised John Boyega for his emotional speech at a Black Lives Matter protest in London on Wednesday.""Black lives have always mattered,"" said the Star Wars actor. ""We have always been important. We have always succeeded regardless.""He paid tribute to African-American George Floyd, who died in police custody on 25 May - but said his comments could damage his career.Instead, Hollywood offered its support.""We got you, John,"" said Peele, the Oscar-winning director of Get Out.""Happy to work with you any time, John,"" said Harry Potter author JK Rowling, whose third Fantastic Beasts film is currently in pre-production. She tweeted applause emojis in response to his speech.Boyega, who was born in London to parents of Nigerian descent, observed: ""I don't know if I'm going to have a career after this."" Film maker Matthew A Cherry, who won an Oscar this year for animated short film Hair Love - about an African-American father styling his daughter's hair for the first time, added his support.A tearful Boyega, who starred as Finn in the latest Star Wars trilogy, made his comments while addressing demonstrators in London's Hyde Park.""I'm speaking to you from my heart,"" said the 28-year-old through a megaphone.""Today is about innocent people who were halfway through their process,"" he continued""We don't know what George Floyd could have achieved, we don't know what Sandra Bland could have achieved, but today we're going to make sure that won't be an alien thought to our young ones.""Black lives have always mattered, we have always been important, we have always meant something and we have always succeeded, regardless.""And now is the time, and I ain't waiting.""Booksmart actress and filmmaker Olivia Wilde was among the first to reply to Boyega's speech, saying: ""Absolutely. I would be honoured to work with John Boyega and can only hope to have the chance. We've got your back, John. Don't hold back.""Boyega's Star Wars co-star Mark Hamill, who plays Luke Skywalker, tweeted his praise, saying: ""Never been more proud of you, John,"" signing his message ""dad.""The official Star Wars account added that the series and its producers Lucasfilm ""stands with John Boyega and his message that now is the time. Black lives have always mattered"".""The evil that is racism must stop. We will commit to being part of the change that is long overdue in the world. John Boyega, you are our hero.""Mr Floyd died in Minneapolis last week after a police officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. Derek Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, while three other officers face charges of aiding and abetting murder.The death has caused protests and sporadic rioting in America, along with global mass demonstrations.The London protestors later moved from Hyde Park to Parliament Square and Downing Street to make their voices heard.Writer and producer Jack Thorne, whose credits include the stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, also voiced his support. ""I have worked with John Boyega and would cut my hand off to work with him again,"" he said, describing Boyega as ""a magnificent talent"".""Yo John Boyega,"" posted writer and producer Tracy Y Oliver, ""just say the word. Lucky and grateful to have you act in anything I'm working on"". Oliver co-wrote films including 2017's Girls Trip, which starred Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, Tiffany Haddish, and Jada Pinkett Smith.Actress Yvette Nicole Brown, who starred in US TV series Community and also had a cameo role in Avengers: Endgame,  said: ""Dear John Boyega, I see you and I love you. Thank you for loving us.""""And know this, being on the right side of history is better than any paycheck complicit silence would provide,"" she added.""I stand with you. We stand with you.""",4 June 2020,entertainment
What journalist-haters get wrong,"Across the world today, journalists are under sustained attack.We know a lot more about it, as we know about the death of George Floyd, because of smartphones. When I say attack, I don't mean the broad ways in which their trade has been undermined, or their daily lives made more difficult, for example by the digital destruction of many traditional business models. When I say attack, I mean punched, beaten, bloodied and killed. For doing their job.Jamal Khashoggi is one of the most high-profile victims of recent years, murdered and mutilated for having the temerity to point out, on more than one occasion, that the House of Saud has not been a historic champion of universal human rights.Further back, but still very much within living memory, Anna Politkovskaya was killed for daring to get close to the truth about the modern Russian state, not least its activities in Chechnya.Just this week, we have seen a grim escalation, as protests and riots in response to Floyd's killing tear at the fabric of America. The attacks on journalists have been led by the US President, who has regularly cast them as ""enemy of the people"".On Saturday night, police in Minneapolis shot rubber bullets at two members of a Reuters crew in Minneapolis. Cameraman Julio-Cesar Chavez said: ""A police officer that I'm filming turns around and points his rubber-bullet rifle straight at me.""Radio reporter Adolfo Guzman-Lopez took a rubber bullet to his throat.Yesterday, live on Australian television, a cameraman was punched near the White House.  Footage from a different angle clearly shows he displayed no aggression toward the police officer who used the edge of a police shield to hit the cameraman's stomach before punching the lens.A few days ago, my very distinguished colleague Pete Murtaugh was charged at by police officers, not far from the White House. The BBC's Paul Danahar, who runs the BBC News' bureaux across the Americas, was right to say that Peter was ""clearly identifiable as a member of the media"". The camera is always a giveaway, you see.Danahar went on: ""The team had been following all directions from the police as they covered the protests in front of the White House. The assault took place even before the curfew had been imposed, and happened without warning or provocation.""It must be exceptionally tough for police officers trying to uphold law and order. That said, in each of the cases I have mentioned, the journalist was probably identifiable as a member of the media.And as for Pete Murtaugh, you've never heard of him, have you? Well, here's your moment. He's a father of three, universally adored in the BBC's Washington bureau, and widely regarded as one of the outstanding news cameramen of his generation. He lives just outside the city, and is an exceptionally kind and smart bloke.    A few years ago, when I door-stepped Rupert Murdoch outside his office in New York, a lot of people got in touch to say well done (often from within his company, as it happens). But the credit wasn't mine. It was almost all Pete's. I had been looking the other way, facing the camera, when eagle-eyed Pete looked in the distance and saw him coming out of the office. He shouted, ""It's Murdoch!"". For some reason, despite being in New York specifically to cover a story about Rupert Murdoch, something about Pete's accent, and my misspent youth, made me think, 'Why has he suddenly brought up the A Team?'. But that's a story for another day.Between them, Pete and my magnificent producer colleague Elizabeth Needham-Bennett, got us in position to ask the questions.       I had the easiest job of the lot, saying mere words. Look at the clip of that moment: you can clearly see Pete's reflection in Murdoch's car window. My job was to articulate a few sentences. Pete's job was infinitely harder: running with a very heavy camera on his shoulder; adjusting the focus and light exposure; and constantly and instantly responding to my movements and that of Murdoch's driver and security personnel - while keeping the shot tight.Most people could ask Rupert Murdoch some questions on a Manhattan Street. How many could do what Pete Murtaugh did that day, let alone as well as he did? One in 10,000?It's a skill, and that's why we call it a trade, and camera men and women are as much part of the trade as reporters are. In fact, to my mind, they're more important. If you're lucky in news broadcasting, you get to work in teams of three: reporter, producer, camera operator. The reporter is the one who often gets the credit, and is always the best paid. But if the reporter wasn't there, and the camera operator was, you'd still have pictures for the news. Whereas if the camera man or woman wasn't there, you'd have nothing. The single biggest and most frequent mistake made by those currently attacking journalists as enemies of the people is the tendency to react emotionally to some provocation by a high-profile journalist by impugning the whole trade. It's as if, in the minds of these journalist-haters, one famous anchor is by default an ambassador for the millions of people who work in the trade around the world. This is how fame distorts. It gives a false picture to many people of what - and, crucially, who - constitutes journalism. Naturally, President Trump isn't representative of public opinion, but you can see him make this conflation often. When he didn't like a line of questioning by CNN's Jim Acosta, he would attack him - and then by extension CNN.When he didn't like a line of questioning by NBC's Peter Alexander, he didn't just attack Alexander, but NBC and Comcast, which owns it.You see this in many of the attacks against the BBC. Of course, a huge number of criticisms of the BBC are entirely valid and necessary. Moreover, modern media has countless failings, many of them accentuated in recent years by social media. That's why the media these days is so often the story itself.But the species of criticism which begins from disapproval of what one well-paid, high-profile figure says on a particular occasion, to eviscerate the whole organisation, as if that one person represents more than 20,000 others, is sloppy.Journalism, as I have said elsewhere, is a noble trade whose higher callings are to inform the citizenry, apply scrutiny to power, and enlighten a culture, by spreading ideas and ideals. Cameramen and women, and producers and sub-editors and fact-checkers, all contribute to this effort. Most of them are not famous. In fact, most people in journalism - though obviously not all - are decent, civilised, public-spirited people who enjoy elegant sentences, could get paid better elsewhere, and are in it more to scratch an itch for information than adulation.They are local reporters knocking on doors to make sure silenced voices are heard, or sitting in tedious council meetings to ensure bureaucrats don't get away with deceit, or fixing interviews with people who want to contribute to a phone-in. In their small way, all these courses of human action fortify the collective effort of the trade.What, after all, are camera operators who chronicle the unrest in America today doing, if not informing the citizenry, and so helping to apply scrutiny to power? The work is vital, the danger growing; and the reward often smaller than you think, financially at least. They also, I can report, have a preference not to be targeted by democratically elected leaders - or punched in the face. Is that too much to ask?If you're interested in issues such as these, please follow me on Twitter or Facebook; and also please subscribe to The Media Show podcast from Radio 4.

EastEnders: BBC One soap will run out of new episodes on 16 June,"The last new episode of EastEnders will be broadcast on Tuesday 16 June, the BBC has confirmed.The soap has not filmed any new episodes since March amid the coronavirus pandemic.BBC One has been broadcasting fewer weekly episodes since then, in an attempt to make the stock of existing footage last as long as possible.But from 22 June, the channel will broadcast a new programme in its place, celebrating the soap's history.Secrets From The Square will see Stacey Dooley sit down with two cast members every Monday to reflect on their time on the show.The programme will also tease what's to come when EastEnders returns and take viewers behind the scenes of the soap.Letitia Dean, Tameka Empson, Danny Dyer, Adam Woodyatt, Diane Parish and Kellie Bright will be among the actors sharing their memories of working on EastEnders.Dooley, a documentary maker and former winner of Strictly Come Dancing, said she was ""delighted"" to be hosting the series. ""I grew up watching EastEnders, so walking on to Albert Square was a surreal experience, as well as taking a trip down memory lane. She added: ""Interviewing some of the legends of Walford has been great, I've loved every minute.""The BBC said social distancing guidelines will be strictly adhered to on the programme.In addition to Secrets From The Square airing on Mondays, classic episodes of EastEnders will be broadcast every Tuesday.The BBC said the old episodes being repeated will include ""the classic two-hander between Den and Angie, Sharongate and the explosive reveal of Max and Stacey's affair"".EastEnders will begin filming new episodes again at the end of June.",4 June 2020,entertainment
Peter Crouch on jumping from planes and 'the ultimate retirement',"When Peter Crouch made his debut as a TV football pundit in 2014, he got a bit of a shock.""I went to India for a week to do the World Cup as a pundit. I thought I'd cut my cloth out there,"" he recalled on That Peter Crouch Podcast last year. ""We were in Mumbai, and on my first appearance I was with Mikaël Silvestre and a Bollywood star.""We had a little rehearsal and [the producer] said, 'Right, so the game's about to start, we'll be live in 10 minutes. Here's the touchscreen, so when you use the touchscreen at half time...' and I was like, 'Excuse me?'""Crouch was completely unfamiliar with how to use the device - which allows pundits to freeze-frame moments from the game and draw on-screen graphics to highlight players and analyse strategies.""I was dropped into that situation thinking, 'How have I got myself into this position where I'm live to two billion people with a Bollywood star and Mikaël Silvestre, with a touchscreen I've never used before?!'""Needless to say, when the show went live ""there was a lot of buttons that I didn't use... I went with a couple of bendy arrows and moving players"".Fortunately, Crouchy is feeling better prepared for his new TV series - Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer - which begins on BBC One this Saturday. He's got some help too, in the shape of co-presenters Maya Jama and comedian Alex Horne. Unusually for a TV show at the moment, all the presenters will be in the same studio - albeit socially distanced.The show was originally intended to be a post-match series for Euro 2020 but, of course, football matches were among the many events postponed or cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""The Euros got cancelled, Glastonbury got cancelled, the Olympics are cancelled, Wimbledon cancelled... It's not been a great summer has it?"" says Crouch.""So we thought we needed to bring smiles to people's faces, so instead of it being around the Euros, we tried to make it around all those things.""The format has now morphed into a wider Saturday night show fusing sport, music and entertainment.""Some of the people that were supposed to be at the Olympics have kindly signed up, and we've got a tournament going on,"" Crouch explains. ""We've got people playing live gigs, and some amazing guests.""I think it'll take people's minds off what's been going on. It's going to be good fun.""In his professional career, Crouch played a total of 468 Premier League matches for Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa, Southampton, Liverpool, Portsmouth, Stoke City and Burnley.Before retiring last July, the striker had scored 108 goals in the top flight, of which 53 were scored with his head - a Premier League record.But, like many retired footballers before him, he's now transitioning into a successful broadcast career.While Dion Dublin has been presenting Homes Under The Hammer and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has become one of the BBC's biggest stars, Crouch has built a hugely successful podcast with co-hosts Tom Fordyce and Chris Stark. That Peter Crouch Podcast from 5 Live is into its fourth series, and was the most downloaded BBC podcast in the first quarter of this year. In 2019, the show racked up 12 million downloads, despite only releasing 15 new episodes.You may have seen the trailers for Save Our Summer, which feature several ""two-metre Peters"" - cardboard cut-outs of the footballer which came in extremely useful when applying social distancing rules during rehearsals.Asked what attracted him to the show, Horne jokes it was ""mainly Crouchy's beauty"", but adds the new format could be an improvement on the original idea.""I actually think not having the football in it is going to make it a lot better, because we now don't have to talk about the home nations' disappointing performances,"" he laughs.""Yeah we've ruined enough summers, to be honest,"" Crouch admits.Horne continues: ""It's great to have a live band in the studio. There aren't enough shows with actual bands playing live - it's basically Strictly and that's it. So it's a really good atmosphere in there. ""And obviously we don't have an audience but we don't really need it, because there's nine of us before the guests come on. So it feels great in there, really fun and summery.""For Jama, who recently announced her departure from Radio 1, it's a chance to return to her roots.""I actually started as a football presenter... so I thought we were going to do sporty fun [on the show],"" she says.""But obviously my first love is music and entertainment, so when I found out that it was changing and we were going to be able to have everything in one, and on Saturday night, I was like: 'Obviously. Of course.'""Halfway through the press launch for Save Our Summer, Crouch has to pause briefly to restore order in the house. ""Can you see this?"" he asks. ""The dog's run in, there's mud all over the carpet, all the kids have come in, Ab [wife Abbey Clancy] is going mental. And I'm in the posh living room. Apologies, carry on.""Back on track - Crouch explains that some elements of the series were filmed pre-lockdown. ""Part of the show is me doing the ultimate retirement,"" he says. ""I've been taking a few ex-team-mates who have retired as well to do things we couldn't do when we were playing, and the first one I did with JJ [former Tottenham team-mate Jermaine Jenas] was jumping out of a plane. ""I felt confident the whole way through and as soon as we got to jumping out, that's when I started losing it. When I jumped out, I've never been so cold. My feet were like blocks of ice and it sort of took away the enjoyment of the whole process.""He adds: ""In some ways, I hope this show never gets commissioned again, because I've been close to death on a few occasions. It's not been fun, it's been excruciating at times, and jumping out of a plane was one of them.""One of the main benefits of getting in front of the camera, he adds, has been keeping himself busy at a time when many retired players feel at a loose end.""I was so scared about retiring from football. You hear stories about people struggling and sitting there not having much to do, watching Loose Women,"" he says.""And listen, I love Loose Women, but I didn't want to sit there and have not a lot to do. So I took on a few things, and the things I've taken on are only things I enjoy doing.""Which, in the case of his new TV show, hopefully won't involve too many touchscreens.Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer begins on BBC One at 21:15 BST on Saturday.",3 June 2020,entertainment
The Infinite Monkey Cage: BBC radio show trials virtual audience,"This week, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the BBC has recorded its first programme with a live audience listening from home. Could this be the new normal for radio comedy shows? ""Can you give us a cheer so we know you're there? That's great! Now can you laugh as if I just said something really hilarious?""It's Monday evening, and Radio 4 producer Sasha Feachem is warming up the audience ahead of a recording of science comedy show The Infinite Monkey Cage.But we, the audience, are not in the BBC's radio theatre as we normally would be. Instead we've tuned in over Zoom to hear a new episode of the programme being recorded virtually. For the next hour or so, it's our job to react to whatever the panellists are saying - starting with a quick sound check that sees us clapping, cheering and (fake) laughing.Behaving as if you're a member of a big crowd when you're sitting at home feels strange. But there's no doubt it adds something we've all been missing from comedy programmes recently - namely, atmosphere.""That was wonderful,"" presenter Robin Ince says as the programme gets going. ""The idea that there are loads of people sitting alone in their house just applauding, and everyone in their street is going 'Oh my god, is it 8pm on Thursday already?'""The Infinite Monkey Cage is the perfect show on which to test out a virtual audience. You can imagine the show's dedicated fans being delighted to take part in a recording which is itself an experiment.Furthermore, it won't be a major disaster if it doesn't work. Because Monkey Cage is a science programme and not exclusively a comedy show, there isn't the constant reliance on laughter there would be on The Now Show, Dead Ringers or Just A Minute. Ince and co-host Brian Cox tell the at-home audience the episode will combine space, genetics and archaeology, with guests including comedian Sara Pascoe, biological anthropologist Alice Roberts and archaeologist Sarah Parcak.And with that, we're off.The panellists rattle through topics including Ancient Egypt, undiscovered civilisations in Africa and how much Neanderthal DNA is present in humans today. All the guests appear on screen as part of a group Zoom meeting - with the audience represented, appropriately, by an image of an empty auditorium.But in every other way, it's just like a normal episode of The Infinite Monkey Cage.As audience members we can hear each others' reactions to what the panel says, which itself encourages us to laugh or clap more. We can't see each other, so it's not clear how many of us there are. But even a crowd with fewer than 100 people in it is enough to add some much-needed pace and momentum. There's only one technical hitch in the whole recording, which comes just as Parcak is discussing early erotic poetry.""One of my favourite things to do if I'm teaching an archaeology class around Valentine's Day is to read ancient Egyptian love poetry - and it will turn your ears purple,"" she laughs.""It's incredibly erotic, they were extraordinarily expressive of love. They talk about having their hearts broken, cheating husbands, the same stuff we read today - it's glorious.""At this point, producer Sasha has to interrupt the recording briefly to fix a technical problem with one of the microphones.""Isn't that typical!"" jokes Ince. ""Just as we get to the filth. Typical BBC, isn't it?""Fortunately things get back on track and Parcak picks up with a tale of some of the earliest recorded pornography.You can hear the audience laughing heartily as she describes Egyptian papyrus that featured drawings of dancing lions or cats playing games on one side and erotic drawings on the other.""That's essentially the internet now - it's half porn and half cats playing the piano,"" jokes Pascoe, prompting much laughter from the virtual crowd.This recording is the first proper attempt by the BBC to recreate what live comedy used to be like, before the coronavirus pandemic. Some comedy programmes have struggled to maintain their usual momentum recently, including Have I Got News For You and The Graham Norton Show. While the quality of the writing and the interviews on these recent episodes may be as strong as ever, the jokes still fall flat when met with the sound of silence. And so, depending on what the finished product is like once it's edited, Monkey Cage could provide a blueprint of how comedy shows will sound for the next few months or more. The episode we attend on Monday, which will be released as a podcast next week, lasts a little over an hour and will be chopped down to about 30 minutes.It's hard to predict how it will sound on air. During the recording the noise of other audience members is relatively quiet in the mix, so as not to drown out the panellists. But when everything is mixed for broadcast, and the audience can be heard at normal volume, it's likely the presence of a crowd will make a significant difference.There's no doubt that the programme is better, funnier and livelier with a virtual audience. It's not perfect, and certainly not as good as the real thing. But until some kind of normality can resume, it works perfectly well for now. As Ince puts it: ""What a strange, beautiful thing it is. We're alone but we're together.""",2 June 2020,entertainment
"Coco, Marley and Me, and more movies to make you cry hard","If you often find yourself quietly (or loudly) sobbing at an emotional film, here's a warning - get an extra box of tissues before watching the films mentioned in this article.When US film critic Kevin Lee asked people to tell him ""the hardest you've ever cried in a movie/TV show"" on Twitter last week, he was unprepared for the onslaught that followed.""Within the first six hours, the responses were unlike anything I've ever received before,"" he says. ""It was a little bit scary to tell you the truth.""Film fans bombarded him with the titles that have left them in puddles of tears. He was even more surprised that some replies were accompanied by personal stories about why the films meant so much.""The responses were very sweet and each one was so different,"" he says.The BBC has analysed 35,000 replies. The top two tear-jerking films are not sweeping epics or heavyweight dramas - they are family favourites that tug hard at the heartstrings.Disney/Pixar's Oscar-winning 2017 animation Coco tops the mentions, thanks to its powerful story of a Mexican boy who crosses to the Land of the Dead and uncovers his family secrets while following his dream of becoming a musician.It is followed closely by 2008's Marley and Me, in which Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston's couple adopt an unruly Labrador, which accompanies them through their family life.Those two films were some way above anything else. This is not a scientific survey of course, but here are the top 10 films mentioned in replies to Kevin Lee's tweet.Lee, who writes for Film Inquiry and That Shelf, was not surprised to see Coco at the top of the list. ""I adored that film, and it just gets better and better with every viewing,"" he tells BBC News.""It takes familiar messages like 'pursue your dream' but adds extra layers, such as understanding your heritage, how that shapes you, how you help that culture evolve, and it honours those traditions while still being progressive and moving forward.""And the story is so emotional and the characters are so relatable - I think that is what got to many, many audiences.""Three animations, all Disney/Pixar creations, are in the top 10. Up is another cross-generational story, while Toy Story 3 has been described by Buzzfeed as ""probably one of the saddest movies of this generation"".Lee says he is a ""sucker"" for animated films because it's easier to be transported to, and immersed in, the worlds they create, he says.""Animation is so free to create their own premise, have that premise elevate the story they want to tell,"" he explains. ""Because of that it's so easy to disarm myself and let the story take me over.""Overall, two types of emotional storylines kept cropping up in fans' replies, he says.""One is crying over a character dying, either because they've grown so emotionally attached to that character and it's heartbreaking, or they'll share a personal story about how they lost someone close to them,"" he says.One user got in touch to tell him he was particularly moved by Coco because his own grandmother had recently died. (The grandmother in Coco is pivotal to that film's emotional punch.)""The other common trait I saw were films that were based on real history,"" Lee says. ""You had Schindler's List, Life Is Beautiful, Sophie's Choice, Saving Private Ryan, Grave of the Fireflies…""There are a lot of historical films that show the darkest chapters of human history [and] that really gets to people.""And when it comes to the darkest chapters of human history, that's when you see the worst of humanity but you also see the best of humanity, so it's both devastating but really moving as well. You're not quite sure if you're crying sad tears or happy tears.""Many of the films unsurprisingly involve (spoiler alert) death or departures in one form or another.The other top picks ranged from female-led 1980s dramas Terms of Endearment, Beaches and Steel Magnolias to 2019's Avengers: Endgame, which had its fair share of gut-wrenching moments between the superhero action.Lee believes his original tweet touched such a nerve partly because of the current coronavirus lockdown.""My only theory is I touched on the zeitgeist of how everyone's feeling at the moment,"" he reflects.""Everyone is way more isolated now, and there are a lot of folks out there who are alone in this lockdown. ""Perhaps this thread got a lot of people to want to just reach out and connect with others, and the current atmosphere has allowed people to open up with more personal stuff.""",2 June 2020,entertainment
Bafta TV Awards: Chernobyl and The Crown among nominees,"Chernobyl leads the field at this year's Bafta Television Awards, with 14 nominations.The Sky Atlantic miniseries, which was heavily praised by critics, was based on the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.It becomes one of the most-nominated shows in the ceremony's history, tying with the 14 nominations Killing Eve received last year.Netflix's Royal drama The Crown has seven nominations in total.Other nominees at this year's ceremony include Fleabag and Giri/Haji - which receive six nominations each.The Virtues, Killing Eve, Sex Education and Top Boy have also been recognised.Chernobyl has three nominations for the main awards and 11 for Bafta's Craft Awards, which were revealed together. Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Jamie Demetriou are the most-nominated individuals this year, with three nods each.Chat show host Graham Norton and Famalam star Gbemisola Ikumelo have two individual nominations each.The nominees for the Must See Moment category were announced earlier this week, with nods for Game of Thrones, Line of Duty and Love Island.We've been digging a bit deeper into this year's nominations list, and here are a few things we noticed:At least, certainly not for Glenda Jackson.She is nominated for leading actress at the age of 84, for her performance in Elizabeth Is Missing.Coincidentally, Jackson's last nomination at the Bafta TV awards was in 1972, for the similarly-titled (but totally unrelated) Elizabeth R, a series based on Queen Elizabeth I.Dame Thora Hird was nominated for a Bafta aged 89 back in 2000 for the drama Lost for Words, and Dame Maggie Smith was nominated for Downton Abbey at the age of 77.Elizabeth Is Missing was Jackson's first TV role in 27 years. She stepped away from acting in 1992 to pursue a career in politics, becoming a Labour MP, retiring in 2015.Gentleman Jack star Suranne Jones and Killing Eve's Jodie Comer are also nominated for leading actress, along with Samantha Morton for her performance in I Am Kirsty.The best actor nominees include Callum Turner, Jared Harris and Takehiro Hira, while Stephen Graham is recognised for his work in The Virtues.Some TV shows in the running this year have been cancelled in the time it's taken the nominations to come out.BBC One's The Greatest Dancer is up for best entertainment programme, despite being pulled after its recent second series.Its first series in January 2019 (the one nominated), was presented by Alesha Dixon and Jordan Banjo, and saw amateur dancers compete to impress judges Cheryl, Oti Mabuse and Matthew Morrison.An episode of BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme about knife crime is nominated in the news coverage category.Earlier this year, the BBC announced the programme was ending as part of a plan to save £80m in BBC News over four years.However, director general Lord Hall has said he hopes the programme's journalism ""will find a home on the news channel and elsewhere around the BBC"".A Newsnight special in which Prince Andrew was interviewed by Emily Maitlis is also nominated for news coverage. Other nominees in the category include ITV News coverage of the general election results in December and Sky News coverage of the Hong Kong protests. With just four nominee slots available in each category, it's inevitable that some major actors and TV shows won't be recognised.Andrew Scott, who captivated Fleabag's viewers as the ""Hot Priest"", misses out on an acting nomination. While The Crown is heavily nominated at the ceremony, Olivia Colman does not receive a nomination for her portrayal of The Queen.Claire Foy was previously nominated for playing the same role earlier in the series, but Vanessa Kirby - who played Princess Margaret - is the only person to have won an acting award for The Crown.Two of the year's most-watched programmes, Line of Duty and the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special, are nominated only in the Must See Moment category.Years and Years, one of the best-reviewed (but least-watched) series of 2019, doesn't feature in this year's list, and nor does BBC Three documentary Jesy Nelson: Odd One Out, which scooped a National Television Award in January.Peaky Blinders, Britain's Got Talent and The Great British Bake Off, have been recognised at the ceremony in the past but are not nominated this year.While the Bafta TV Awards have never been embroiled in a diversity crisis, their sister awards ceremony certainly has.Earlier this year, the Bafta Film Awards were criticised for only having white acting nominees (including two for Margot Robbie in the same category).At this year's TV awards, there are BAME nominations in most acting categories, including Takehiro Hira (Giri/Haji), Naomi Ackie (The End of the F***ing World), Jasmine Jobson (Top Boy), Ncuti Gatwa (Sex Education), Guz Khan (Man Like Mobeen) and Gbemisola Ikumelo (Famalam).Away from acting, Mo Gilligan is recognised for entertainment performance, while two different shows fronted by Romesh Ranganathan are nominated - one in the features category and the other in comedy entertainment.Bafta said there is a 22% increase of nominees of colour across the performance categories this year, compared with 2019.This year's ceremony will be broadcast from behind closed doors after being delayed amid the coronavirus pandemic.Richard Ayoade will host from a closed studio and winners will give acceptance speeches virtually.The winners will be announced on 31 July, with the ceremony broadcast on BBC One.In a statement, actor, presenter and writer Ayoade joked: ""I am as surprised as you are that this is still going ahead.""Bafta's Craft Awards, meanwhile, which celebrate behind-the-scenes achievements, will be streamed on 17 July, hosted by fellow comic actor Stephen Mangan.Categories such as writing, sound, editing and production design will be handed out at the Craft Awards, while prizes for acting and best overall series will be announced at the Bafta TV Awards.",4 June 2020,entertainment
