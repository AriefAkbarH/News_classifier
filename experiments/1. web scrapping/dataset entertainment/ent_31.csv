Mel Gibson and Winona Ryder at odds over anti-Semitism claims,"Mel Gibson and Winona Ryder have become embroiled in a row after she claimed he made anti-Semitic comments to her.The actress said he referred to her as an ""oven dodger"" in an apparent reference to her Jewish background.Gibson's representative said Ryder's allegations, which she made in 2010 and repeated in a recent interview with The Sunday Times, were ""100% untrue"".Ryder responded by asserting again that she and a late friend had been ""on the receiving end of his hateful words"".The Stranger Things actress described the alleged encounter as ""a painful and vivid memory"".Ryder first made the claims in an interview with GQ in 2010. She told this weekend's Sunday Times: ""We were at a crowded party with one of my good friends, and Mel Gibson was smoking a cigar, and we're all talking and he said to my friend, who's gay, 'Oh wait, am I gonna get Aids?'""And then something came up about Jews, and he said, 'You're not an oven dodger, are you?'""Ryder, 48, said Gibson, 64, had tried to apologise to her at a later date.The Braveheart star's representative disputed Ryder's version of events, however, accusing her of ""lying"" about both the alleged comments and apology.Gibson, he claimed, ""did reach out to [Ryder], many years ago, to confront her about her lies and she refused to address it with him"".Ryder responded by offering more details, including that the encounter occurred ""around 1996"".""I believe in redemption and forgiveness and hope that Mr Gibson has found a healthy way to deal with his demons, but I am not one of them,"" she said in a statement.""Only by accepting responsibility for our behaviour in this life can we make amends and truly respect each other, and I wish him well on this life-long journey.""Ryder, whose father is Jewish, was born Winona Laura Horowitz in 1971. In the Sunday Times she said she was ""not religious"" but identified as Jewish.It is not the only time Gibson has been accused of using the offensive term, which alludes to the mass murder of Jews in Nazi death camps during World War Two.In 2012 screenwriter Joe Eszterhas accused the actor of using it while they were working on a film about Jewish hero Judah Maccabee.Gibson, who made widely documented anti-Semitic comments when he was arrested for drink-driving in 2006, called Eszterhas's claims ""utter fabrications"".This week it was announced that Britain's Aardman Animations is teaming up with Netflix to make its upcoming Chicken Run sequel.It has not been confirmed whether Gibson, who voiced rooster Rocky in the 2000 original, will return to the role.According to The Wrap, however, he will not be invited back when the film goes into production next year.

Jimmy Kimmel: TV host sorry for blackface sketches,"US TV host Jimmy Kimmel has apologised for using make-up to impersonate black stars like Snoop Dogg, Oprah Winfrey and basketball player Karl Malone.Kimmel said he had thought of his performances as ""impersonations of celebrities and nothing more"".But, looking back, he admitted they were ""embarrassing"" and described them as ""thoughtless moments"".He said sorry ""to those who were genuinely hurt or offended by the make-up I wore or the words I spoke"".Kimmel fronts a late-night talk show on ABC and hosted the Oscars in 2017 and 2018.He had been under pressure to address his past use of blackface, especially after fellow presenter Jimmy Fallon issued a similar apology last month.It has also just been revealed that Tina Fey asked for four episodes of sitcom 30 Rock in which characters appear in blackface to be taken down.Kimmel said he had been reluctant to speak about his sketches, however, because he thought that ""would be celebrated as a victory by those who equate apologies with weakness and cheer for leaders who use prejudice to divide us"". He added: ""That delay was a mistake.""In a statement on Tuesday, he explained that he did an impression of former NBA star Malone on his radio show in the 1990s, and continued to impersonate the sportsman when he moved onto TV.""We hired make-up artists to make me look as much like Karl Malone as possible,"" he said. ""I never considered that this might be seen as anything other than an imitation of a fellow human being, one that had no more to do with Karl's skin colour than it did his bulging muscles and bald head.""I've done dozens of impressions of famous people, including Snoop Dogg, Oprah, Eminem, Dick Vitale, Rosie, and many others. In each case, I thought of them as impersonations of celebrities and nothing more.""Looking back, many of these sketches are embarrassing, and it is frustrating that these thoughtless moments have become a weapon used by some to diminish my criticisms of social and other injustices.""He added that he believed he had ""evolved and matured"" over the past two decades.""Thank you for giving me an opportunity to explain and to those I've disappointed, I am sorry,"" he concluded.",23 June 2020,entertainment

Teen girls being preyed on by older men has never been taken seriously and still isn't.""Writing on Instagram, Fox said: ""Please hear me when I thank you for your support but these specific instances were inconsequential in a long and arduous journey along which I have endured some genuinely harrowing experiences in a ruthlessly misogynistic industry.""When it comes to my direct experiences with Michael, I was never assaulted or preyed upon in what I felt was a sexual manner.""She said she was posting in order to ""clarify some details as they have been lost in the retelling of the events and cast a sinister shadow that doesn't really, in my opinion, belong"".

"How and when will cinemas reopen in England, and which films can you see?","Cinemas in England can reopen from 4 July, the government has confirmed - although many will not be ready to do so by that date.Below, find out which cinemas are reopening when, what safety measures will be in place, and which films you'll be able to watch.Of the UK's main cinema chains:Vue had previously been aiming for 4 July, but needs more time to make the necessary preparations.Many independent cinemas are choosing to wait longer. In a survey by the Independent Cinema Office, 13% of venues said they would be back in July, with 15% reopening in August and a further 23% in September.Manchester's Home is among those holding off until September. Executive director Jon Gilchrist said July was not the best option for venues ""whose programmes do not focus on the summer blockbusters"".He said: ""Instead we want to take the time to ensure that we have time to make the necessary adjustments to the building, and to speak to our audiences about how they can be involved in our plans.""Details of reopenings in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have yet to be announced by the respective governments.The chains that have detailed their safety procedures have said they will put in place:The UK Cinema Association will publish full government-agreed guidelines for reopening in the coming days.Showcase, which has released the greatest detail, said it would encourage customers to use face masks, although a safety video suggests people can remove them once they have taken their seats.The chain also promised that an ""anti-viral fogging machine"" will be used on every seat between every screening, and each auditorium will have an air purifying system. People will be able to order popcorn and snacks in advance, and scan their own tickets to gain entry.Vue said it was waiting for advice from government, but that its methods had been ""responsibly and robustly"" tested in its venues in countries like Taiwan, Germany and Denmark.Odeon said it had been ""working hard to implement new health and safety measures across all of our sites"", and Cineworld said it was following government guidelines ""in order to make cinemagoers feel as comfortable and safe as possible"".Cinemas that are open in early- and mid-July will start by showing classic films.Vue has said it will screen a 2K print of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back plus Christopher Nolan's Inception for its 10th anniversary.Cinemas have been given access to an archive of 450 films to choose from while the schedule of new releases ramps up.Then, major new film releases scheduled for July include:In the autumn and winter - assuming cinemas are not forced to shut again - there will be a glut of big movies, many of which had been delayed. They include: A Quiet Place Part II (4 September), The King's Man (16 September), Wonder Woman 1984 (2 October), Black Widow (28 October), No Time To Die (12 November), Soul (20 November), and Top Gun: Maverick (23 December).",23 June 2020,entertainment
'It was precarious and still is': Bookshops fight back against virus and Amazon,"Before lockdown, the number of independent bookshops in the UK rose for three years in a row. But the pandemic drove customers online - and shops had to get creative to survive.Running an independent bookshop can be a challenge at the best of times, trying to compete with the might of Amazon and the supermarkets. In recent years, things had been looking up, however, with 890 on our high streets in 2019, up from 867 three years earlier. They took a major hit during lockdown, but most have reopened (except in Scotland) in time for Independent Bookshop Week, which runs until Saturday. Many found new ways to reach readers while their doors were shut, but their long-term futures are still in the balance.""As yet we have no idea how many retail casualties may result from the crisis,"" said Meryl Halls, head of the Booksellers Association.Bookbugs and Dragon Tales in Norwich had only been open for seven months when it was forced to shut again. ""We hadn't factored a global pandemic into the business plan, surprisingly,"" owner Leanne Fridd laughs.She thought about getting a job in a supermarket when the virus struck, but decided to try to keep the business going, making the most of one thing an Amazon algorithm can't match - a personal touch.She put together home-school packs, bundling together educational, activity and story books based on each child's interests and age. She also created adult escape packs with a personalised selection of novels plus relaxing treats and mindful activities.She and husband Dan also made their online store more prominent and ran online storytelling sessions and book groups.""When people are at home and the internet is just there, we are fully aware that people have an alternative, and potentially a cheaper alternative, and we can't possibly match that. No independent bookshop can,"" she says.""All indies try and offer something that goes a little bit further. We know your children, we watch them grow, we care about your family. So we felt it was really important to say, 'We're still here for you', and people have been responding to that quite nicely.""Even so, turnover was only 20% of the pre-pandemic level. She furloughed both members of staff and wasn't eligible for the government's self-employment support.End of Youtube post  by Bookbugs & Dragon TalesThe shop reopened last week, with the necessary safety measures and reduced hours. In the afternoons, customers can book a 15-minute slot to have the shop to themselves, their bubble or family.""They don't have to worry about social distancing from anyone apart from us, and we're obviously suited and booted,"" she says. ""That's been really effective because a lot of the families have said, 'This is the first time we've brought our children out, this is the first shop we've been into'.""The future is still uncertain, she says. ""We're still very far from out of the woods but the bigger fear was that we wouldn't be able to survive - and still is. But we try and be really optimistic and positive and do everything we can.""If we don't survive, it won't be because we haven't poured our heart and soul into everything, trying so many different ways to help people feel engaged with us.""When lockdown was imposed, The Rabbit Hole in Brigg, Lincolnshire, didn't have an online shop to speak of, and decided it wasn't worth trying to create one at short notice.""We concentrated on other things and just tried to get through,"" says Nick Webb, who runs the shop with wife Mel.""We worked with a lot of authors and a lot of kids' groups doing Zoom sessions. We're heavily involved with schools - we're both ex-teachers - so every week we were doing that. It was another way that we kept in contact with people.""The authors who took part included Richard O'Neill, Katie Brosnan and Onjali Q Rauf. ""We try to improve the diversity of books that go out to kids, so it's not just what they see on - how shall I phrase this - big online retailers, and in the supermarkets,"" Webb explains.""They all spent time talking to the kids on Zoom about books and illustrations - you name it, they talked about it. And it worked really well.""And we don't know how it happened, but a little lad from South Korea joined. He asked his mum for permission, because it's midnight in South Korea when it's 4pm here.""Brigg is a market town, so The Rabbit Hole took over a stall when outdoor markets were allowed to reopen from 1 June, two weeks before the shop itself.The shop originally opened three years ago. The Webbs were not eligible for the government's self-employment support, which gives 80% of average monthly profits based on the past three years.The shop didn't make a profit for the first two years because they had spent money on the building and stock, Webb explains. When the shop shut in March, the couple couldn't be sure if it would open again.""It's been really difficult, and now it's crossed fingers and let's hope we can rebuild it,"" he says. ""It was just the wrong time. It couldn't have been timed worse for us personally.""It was very precarious and still is. We will just have to see how we go over the next few months. It will be close, but we're pretty determined.""Linghams in Heswall, Merseyside, used to get around two-thirds of its income from events where authors would come and read and sell their books in person, owner Sue Porter estimates.When lockdown began, she came up with an idea to replicate that online, along with three other independent booksellers.The Facebook page for At Home with 4 Indies has so far hosted conversations with Marian Keyes, Joe Wicks and Ian Rankin, with sessions during Independent Bookshop Week culminating with Bernardine Evaraisto on Friday.""The amount of work that goes into it and getting everybody set up on tech and promoting it has been quite phenomenal to be honest,"" Porter says. ""But we have pulled it out of the bag.""It was all about community - to make sure we could provide an hour of relief for our customers, and then if we managed to get the book, they would have several hours of relief after that away from the coronavirus.""They have struggled on occasion to get stock of an author's new book, and online sales have not matched the numbers that would normally be stacked on a shop counter.""It doesn't compare,"" she says. ""It's a little bit more now, but we're miles away from how much we originally sold at our real-life events.""Having built up a following with their free online events, the four shops will start running paid-for author webcasts from September. Customers will get a ticket if they order the book.The four shop owners have been supporting each other the past three months. ""It has been hard, and it's been emotional,"" Porter says. ""If I was having a bad day, the other girls would get in touch with me and vice versa. The emotional struggle has been absolutely huge.""She furloughed her seven staff when lockdown was imposed, and reopened the shop on Monday, a week later than many places, because of work being done to the shop's cafe.""I haven't had a day off since March when it [lockdown] started,"" she says. ""So I'm looking forward to getting some staff back and maybe taking my foot off the pedal.""",23 June 2020,entertainment
"The Luminaries: Warm reviews, but was it (literally) too dark?","BBC One drama The Luminaries has attracted criticism from some viewers and critics for its darkly lit scenes.The first episode of the series, based on Eleanor Catton's Booker-winning novel, was praised in several reviews after its broadcast on Sunday night.But The Telegraph and The Independent were among those commenting on the difficulties viewing certain scenes.The show's director has previously said the dim lighting is deliberate and adds a ""sense of mystery and intrigue"".The first episode of The Luminaries was watched by an average live audience of 5.3 million - the second highest launch for a BBC drama so far this year after The Salisbury Poisonings.The Luminaries is set on New Zealand's South Island at the height of the 1860s gold rush, and Catton has adapted the book for the small screen herself.""Here we go again with one of the BBC's dark dramas,"" wrote Anita Singh of The Daily Telegraph after the first episode aired. ""I don't mean tonally, although The Luminaries is a tale of murder and weirdness. I mean, literally, dark. ""Look, I know they didn't have brilliant lighting in 19th Century New Zealand but help us out here, we can't see a thing. And it's not as if the rest of The Luminaries is particularly illuminating.""The Independent's Ed Cumming awarded the show four stars, but noted: ""Most things are unclear. The scene is gloomier than Wolf Hall in a candle shortage. ""We can discern echoing voices, gunshots, a warm-lit cabin, a travelling politician, a wounded Maori, but not much else.""In an otherwise positive review, The Sun's Jill Robinson said:  ""The first episode of the new drama wasn't perfect, as the flash-forward scenes were so dark, it was hard to tell what was happening.""This took some of the impact away from some key scenes, and so, at times, The Luminaries needs to be a little more illuminating, otherwise they risk the wrath of viewers.""Many viewers on social media also pointed out the dim lighting, with some saying they had to turn up their brightness while watching.However, director Claire McCarthy said in a previous interview the series was deliberately shot in this way.""The colour palette is more gothic and grounded in the shadows. We wanted a sense of mystery and intrigue and a kind of burnished golden world inside the interiors,"" she explained.""We were very influenced by gold and not only did we have to research how gold could be filmed, and how it would appear on screen, but also just the way that we would light largely through flame, candlelight and natural light. ""We were trying to inhabit the kind of world and the resources that they would have at that time so we embraced that as a visual aesthetic. We wanted there to be a visceral quality to the show, rather than it to feel typically period or dusty, and so there needed to be an energy and a dynamism to the way the camera captured the world.""This isn't the first time a BBC drama has attracted criticism for its dimly-lit scenes.The corporation's 2015 production of Wolf Hall received a similar response - with many viewers and critics complaining about the darkness while praising the show overall.Some critics did not let dim lighting deter them from giving the show a positive review overall.""It is glorious escapism, perfect for our times,"" wrote Lucy Mangan in The Guardian., awarding the first episode four stars.""A cracking, challenging read has become a cracking, unchallenging series and both do their jobs perfectly. Joy.""Characters-with-a-capital-C everywhere, more plot than you know what to do with, hares set running at every turn, lavish period detail and lighting replicating the novel's gorgeous staginess, and a convoluted murder-mystery.""Writing in The Radio Times, Flora Carr said ""All in all, Catton's choice to spin The Luminaries on its axis, with a new focus on the female perspective, feels fresh and needed.""The sprawling novel was always going to be a nightmare to adapt, but by reintroducing us to the story via characters we barely met the first time around, Catton has managed to breathe new life into her tale.""Den of Geek's Louisa Mellor agreed, writing: ""Catton has melted down her extraordinary novel and recast it into a new form, one that, despite some absence of heart, works far, far better than was ever destined. ""As the screenwriter adapting her own work, Catton has given The Luminaries a drastic rewrite, re-centring the story around the fate-pummelled romance of two of the novel's little-seen characters. The mystery and mysticism and complex connections are all still here, but bedded into a more stable set of events.""But in her review for The Telegraph, Singh said: ""It sounds odd to say that a period drama feels dated. But the BBC has been doing such great work of late with modern-day dramas - Normal People, last week's Salisbury Poisonings, the extraordinary I May Destroy You - that The Luminaries seemed a stuffy throwback by comparison. ""It doesn't help that this sort of thing is best suited to autumn, when the nights are drawing in, but has been plonked in the middle of the summer schedule.""In his review for The Independent, Cummings said: ""The Luminaries is luminous, at least when it's visible... Greed has rarely looked so good.""But, he added, the series ""feels crammed in... perhaps no production could fit so much plot into so limited a form.""""There's one lesson from art that would be lost on prospectors: less can be more. In trying to tell such a complex story, The Luminaries risks swamping its viewers. There's gold in those all-black hills, but as in every bonanza, it's hard to tell how much.""The Luminaries, broke two records when it won the Booker Prize in 2013. At 27 years old, Eleanor Catton became the youngest ever winner, while the novel itself was the longest ever book to win, running at more than 800 pages. ",22 June 2020,entertainment
Brooklyn Nine-Nine: New episodes 'in the trash' after George Floyd death,"Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Terry Crews has said four new episodes of the police comedy were thrown ""in the trash"" in the wake of the death of George Floyd.Crews said the show would ""start over"" in light of the anti-racism protests.He said: ""We've had a lot of sombre talks about it and deep conversations and we hope through this we're going to make something that will be truly groundbreaking this year.""We have an opportunity and we plan to use it in the best way possible.""Co-creator Dan Goor had four episodes ""all ready to go"" before Mr Floyd's death a month ago prompted widespread Black Lives Matter protests as well as soul-searching in society in the US and beyond.""They just threw them in the trash,"" Crews told Access Hollywood. ""We have to start over. Right now we don't know which direction it's going to go in.""The actor and America's Got Talent presenter also recounted his own dealings with the police, saying police officers had pointed guns at him, mistakenly, before he became a well-known face.""It's something that every black man has been through and it's hard to really try to get other people to understand,"" he said.The 51-year-old said the momentum for change made it ""Black America's Me Too movement"".""We always knew this was happening, but now white people are understanding,"" he said.Earlier this month, Goor and the cast made a $100,000 (£79,000) donation to the National Bail Fund Network to support ""the many people who are protesting police brutality"".Meanwhile, more than 300 black artists and executives - including Michael B Jordan, Idris Elba and Viola Davis - have signed an open letter calling on Hollywood to invest in black communities and stop the ""glorification of police corruption"" on screen.The letter, published by Variety, was written by Insecure actor Kendrick Sampson, who was hit with police batons and shot with rubber bullets during the recent protests.""The way that Hollywood and mainstream media have contributed to the criminalisation of black people, the misrepresentation of the legal system, and the glorification of police corruption and violence has had dire consequences on Black lives,"" it read.It also demanded greater opportunities for black creatives off-camera and in senior management roles, as well as guaranteeing that marketing budgets were no longer slashed due to ""myths of limited international sales and lack of universality of Black-led stories"".The letter noted how ""distribution and marketing processes are often marred, filtered, and manipulated by the white gaze"".The open call comes in the same week that, in the UK, the BBC committed to investing £100m of its TV budget over a three year period to produce ""diverse and inclusive content"".Terry said the worldwide movement is a chance for deep and meaningful change.""This is an opportunity right now for us all to unite and get together and understand what this is and that we have to battle this together,"" he said.",24 June 2020,entertainment
Mel Gibson and Winona Ryder at odds over anti-Semitism claims,"Mel Gibson and Winona Ryder have become embroiled in a row after she claimed he made anti-Semitic comments to her.The actress said he referred to her as an ""oven dodger"" in an apparent reference to her Jewish background.Gibson's representative said Ryder's allegations, which she made in 2010 and repeated in a recent interview with The Sunday Times, were ""100% untrue"".Ryder responded by asserting again that she and a late friend had been ""on the receiving end of his hateful words"".The Stranger Things actress described the alleged encounter as ""a painful and vivid memory"".Ryder first made the claims in an interview with GQ in 2010. She told this weekend's Sunday Times: ""We were at a crowded party with one of my good friends, and Mel Gibson was smoking a cigar, and we're all talking and he said to my friend, who's gay, 'Oh wait, am I gonna get Aids?'""And then something came up about Jews, and he said, 'You're not an oven dodger, are you?'""Ryder, 48, said Gibson, 64, had tried to apologise to her at a later date.The Braveheart star's representative disputed Ryder's version of events, however, accusing her of ""lying"" about both the alleged comments and apology.Gibson, he claimed, ""did reach out to [Ryder], many years ago, to confront her about her lies and she refused to address it with him"".Ryder responded by offering more details, including that the encounter occurred ""around 1996"".""I believe in redemption and forgiveness and hope that Mr Gibson has found a healthy way to deal with his demons, but I am not one of them,"" she said in a statement.""Only by accepting responsibility for our behaviour in this life can we make amends and truly respect each other, and I wish him well on this life-long journey.""Ryder, whose father is Jewish, was born Winona Laura Horowitz in 1971. In the Sunday Times she said she was ""not religious"" but identified as Jewish.It is not the only time Gibson has been accused of using the offensive term, which alludes to the mass murder of Jews in Nazi death camps during World War Two.In 2012 screenwriter Joe Eszterhas accused the actor of using it while they were working on a film about Jewish hero Judah Maccabee.Gibson, who made widely documented anti-Semitic comments when he was arrested for drink-driving in 2006, called Eszterhas's claims ""utter fabrications"".This week it was announced that Britain's Aardman Animations is teaming up with Netflix to make its upcoming Chicken Run sequel.It has not been confirmed whether Gibson, who voiced rooster Rocky in the 2000 original, will return to the role.According to The Wrap, however, he will not be invited back when the film goes into production next year.
