Major film festivals to unite for YouTube event,"Major film festivals - including Berlin, Cannes, Toronto and Venice - are to join forces for an online event.We Are One: A Global Film Festival, will be hosted by YouTube from 29 May.It comes after coronavirus caused disruption to many international events, as the film industry ground to a halt.The 10-day digital alternative will help to raise funds for the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund and beyond.Twenty festivals from around the world are involved including BFI London Film Festival, Jerusalem Film Festival, Mumbai Film Festival and Marrakech International Film Festival, as well as Sundance Film Festival and Tribeca Film Festival.Tribeca, co-founded by Robert De Niro (pictured above) and Jane Rosenthal in New York, have joined forces with the streaming giants to put on the online event after having been forced to postpone this year's festival.They hope it ""unites curators, artists and storytellers to entertain and provide relief to audiences worldwide"".""We often talk about film's uniquely powerful role in inspiring and uniting people across borders and differences to help heal the world,"" said Rosenthal.""All of the world needs healing right now.""The free event will include films, shorts, documentaries, music, comedy, and conversations and a full schedule will be available nearer to next month's event.According to Deadline, there aren't expected to be any films scheduled for upcoming 2020 festivals for financial and rights reasons.

Why 2020 'is a write-off' for gigs and festivals,"Concerts and festivals will not go ahead in the UK until at least next year, a top virologist and music boss are warning.Many major music, film and comedy events, like Glastonbury, Eurovision, Cannes and Edinburgh Fringe, have already been scrapped, postponed or moved online due to Covid-19 concerns.But others, including Reading and Leeds, the BFI London Film Festival, and a multitude of gigs and rescheduled tours, remain in the 2020 diary.Dr Chris Smith believes it is ""too optimistic"" to think such social gatherings will take place.""We won't even have got a vaccine into people by then,"" the Cambridge University lecturer tells the BBC.""The government has cost the country billions to get the transmission rate right down, and we know that a very good catalyst for spreading the thing and amplifying cases is getting loads of people together again, and that's exactly what goes on at concerts, matches, and other kinds of parties.""So I can't see them saying, 'You know what, we think everyone needs a party' - it's too soon.""Several UK promoters and venues still hoping to host events in some form told us they were unable to detail their post-lockdown plans yet, as they were waiting to take their lead from the government as to how and when they might safely proceed.This weekend, Downing Street officials are expected to reveal plans to re-start the economy in stages, after the Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that the UK was past the peak of the outbreak.The saving grace of when we might get to see our favourite artists in action again is unlikely to be high on their agenda, but a government spokeswoman told the BBC on Monday that it recognised these are ""incredibly challenging times for art and entertainment venues"".""We are supporting the sector through the substantial financial measures the government has announced and are continuing to work together to plan for the future,"" she said.""As soon as it is safe to do so, we will be encouraging everyone to visit and experience the UK's fantastic cultural offerings again.""Dr Smith, who also hosts the Naked Scientists podcast, is confident we will ultimately return to enjoying such collective experiences - as they ""appeal to the human nature"" - but only after most people in the country have either been infected with the disease (herd immunity), or inoculated (vaccines or combinations of drugs) in some way.In ""the near-term"", he says, ""it's just not going to happen.""""I think this year is basically a write-off, if I'm honest with you,"" he adds.These sobering sentiments were echoed again by former Creation Records and current Creation23 label supremo Alan McGee on Boogaloo Radio on Monday, who said the government ""are never going to allow 200 people to congregate [this year].""""Also nobody is going to want to go to a show at the moment,"" he went on.Theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh declared this week that the West End and Broadway are unlikely to be able to stage musicals until early next year, and the Hay Literature Festival unveiled its first-ever digital programme in lieu of an actual event.But the boss of one of the UK's biggest cinema chains is optimistic the business can reopen in mid-July, noting it can ""control how many people come into"" the building.Vue Cinemas' chief executive Tim Richards told the BBC he is still talking to the authorities about social distancing measures. If all goes to plan, the chain could be back in business for the launch of director Christopher Nolan's action movie Tenet on 17 July, he said.Despite having sympathy for those in the dormant creative industries - many of which Dr Smith fears ""won't ever recover"" from the ""monumental impact"" of coronavirus - he stresses entertainment figures now need to think ""not with their wallet, but with their head screwed on,"" to avoid ""undoing all the great work that has been done"" by the NHS.He suggests it might be conceivable to reopen some art galleries and museums; where people can often move around more freely, using similar social distancing measures and restrictions to those seen at supermarkets.However to do so, even intermittently at smaller gig venues, theatres and cinemas in selected towns and cities, would cause ""carnage"", he predicts.""How on earth would we ever have a system that was enforceable where you said, 'You can go to a rock concert and watch Ed Sheeran but you've got to stand two metres apart?' Everyone would just laugh,"" he says.""You've got to think about the bigger picture, which is how do most people get to and get into the venue [at the same time]? If you suddenly have to start telling people, 'you can't all go to the loo together,' can you imagine the carnage?""A campaign is well under way to save more than 550 UK music venues, many of which have had to furlough staff. Reopening them, or picture houses, anytime soon with restrictions, Dr Smith believes, would cause further financial problems, as well as medical ones.""In the short term, we're going to have to rethink all this because it's just not feasible to say, 'let's just translate this into different numbers',"" he adds. ""Because the economics don't work out for the artists and the venue holders, because those venues work at the capacity that they were built for.""Who would spend a fortune buying the rights to show a film in their cinema if they don't know that their cinema is going to be open next week and that they can actually make their money back?""US bioethicist Dr Zeke Emanuel, from the University of Pennsylvania, who hosts the coronavirus podcast Making the Call, agrees that many people will have to wait longer than they might think before attending big events again.""Larger gatherings - conferences, concerts, sporting events - when people say they're going to reschedule this conference or graduation event for October 2020, I have no idea how they think that's a plausible possibility,"" he told the New York Times last month.""I think those things will be the last to return. Realistically we're talking fall 2021 at the earliest.""Elsewhere, the Isle of Wight Festival boss John Giddings told the NME that cancelling their summer event was ""tragic but a no-brainer"", and that he held little hope for gigs and festivals later in the year. ""Will artists, crews and customers even be able to travel?"" he questioned.In answering these questions, the UK can at least learn lessons from other nations, some of whom are weeks/months ahead on their coronavirus timelines.For instance, on Thursday, in the week that Germany reopened some museums, galleries and gardens with strict social distancing rules (including the use of face masks and in some cases, poles), France announced a bailout for culture workers that will also see similar steps from next week.Neither country has decreed concert halls, cinemas or theatres to be safe zones yet, and president Emmanuel Macron indicated there would be no Gallic gatherings of more than 5,000 people until at least September.Spain - where Primavera Sound Festival is still in the offing - plans to phase ""cultural events"" back in later this month, with indoor venues at one-third capacity, and seated outdoor shows of up to 200.In the US, the New York and LA mayors have both said concerts and festivals were ""difficult to imagine"" until 2021. Missouri governor Mike Parson, however, has given the green light for concerts to begin again as early as Monday. And an Arkansas venue will make gig-goers sit in ""fan pods"" six feet apart at a show next week.Oscar-winning director Spike Lee criticised the governor of Georgia's plan to lift quarantine and reopen movie theatres. When China partially did so, after lockdown restrictions were lifted, it soon had to shut them down again, with the reason thought to be coronavirus-related.Business is apparently booming, meanwhile, at the few drive-in cinemas that remain in the States, and Denmark has introduced drive-in concerts as a workaround.Finally, in Sweden, a controversial Malm√∂ venue has continued to put on socially-distanced shows, capped at audiences of 40, throughout the pandemic.Once borders eventually begin to gradually open up, and testing becomes more readily available to the UK public, Dr Smith believes it may become necessary to prove one's immunity in order to travel through international airports.But he says it would be a ""terrible idea"" to start allowing just those who have immunity back into venues, as it could risk ""coercing"" people into deliberately catching the disease (as has happened, historically, with other viruses like chickenpox). The idea being they would take the risk so that they might become immune and then be able to go out and do things.The practitioner says this would also be ""impossible to police"" at venues. And, of course, it's still not certain if you become immune after contracting Covid-19.While the situation is frighteningly complex and ever-changing, it's not all doom and gloom for entertainment fans.The ""new normal"" for consuming stuff online - like the One World: Together at Home benefit concert, and the upcoming We Are One: A Global Film Festival - Dr Smith concludes, will bring such great technological advances, due to demand, that it will ""make people more comfortable with having a night in"" in the interim.(The owner of Odeon Cinemas wasn't too keen on that idea, banning all Universal films after the studio said it will release new movies at home and on the big screen on the same day).Stufish, who have designed stages for U2, The Rolling Stones and Beyonce, for instance, are looking into how virtual reality could be used to tailor shows for socially-distanced audiences in the future.""It might end up that some gigs are better for it,"" says Dr Smith, ""because you won't be paying Wembley millions of pounds to use their venue and people can engage with you in a way where they will be able to see you.""I'm very grateful we had technology at the stage we had before this happened, because I think it's been our saviour.""",7 May 2020,entertainment

Bafta TV Awards: Richard Ayoade to host socially-distanced delayed ceremony,"This year's Bafta Television Awards will be broadcast from behind closed doors after being delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.The honours are normally handed out at a glittering ceremony attended by the country's biggest TV stars.But this year, Richard Ayoade will host from a closed studio and winners will give acceptance speeches virtually.The event had been due to take place on 17 May, but will now happen on 31 July.

""This is in its early stages and we don't have any further details at the moment.""Sambrook will look at how programmes such as Question Time and Newsnight use social media. Such programmes often share edited clips in isolation on their feeds, without the background or context provided in the full broadcast programme.The BBC's editorial guidelines state: ""Impartiality lies at the heart of public service and is the core of the BBC's commitment to its audiences.""Earlier this week, the BBC said Newsnight's opening monologue, delivered by Emily Maitlis, did not meet impartiality standards.Maitlis said the country was ""shocked"" the government could not see that Boris Johnson's aide Dominic Cummings had broken the rules by travelling from London to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. She added the ""public mood"" was ""one of fury, contempt and anguish"" and that the programme would consider the implications of the prime minister's ""blind loyalty"" to his advisor. A clip of her monologue went viral online.

Why 2020 'is a write-off' for gigs and festivals,"Concerts and festivals will not go ahead in the UK until at least next year, a top virologist and music boss are warning.Many major music, film and comedy events, like Glastonbury, Eurovision, Cannes and Edinburgh Fringe, have already been scrapped, postponed or moved online due to Covid-19 concerns.But others, including Reading and Leeds, the BFI London Film Festival, and a multitude of gigs and rescheduled tours, remain in the 2020 diary.Dr Chris Smith believes it is ""too optimistic"" to think such social gatherings will take place.""We won't even have got a vaccine into people by then,"" the Cambridge University lecturer tells the BBC.""The government has cost the country billions to get the transmission rate right down, and we know that a very good catalyst for spreading the thing and amplifying cases is getting loads of people together again, and that's exactly what goes on at concerts, matches, and other kinds of parties.""So I can't see them saying, 'You know what, we think everyone needs a party' - it's too soon.""Several UK promoters and venues still hoping to host events in some form told us they were unable to detail their post-lockdown plans yet, as they were waiting to take their lead from the government as to how and when they might safely proceed.This weekend, Downing Street officials are expected to reveal plans to re-start the economy in stages, after the Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that the UK was past the peak of the outbreak.The saving grace of when we might get to see our favourite artists in action again is unlikely to be high on their agenda, but a government spokeswoman told the BBC on Monday that it recognised these are ""incredibly challenging times for art and entertainment venues"".""We are supporting the sector through the substantial financial measures the government has announced and are continuing to work together to plan for the future,"" she said.""As soon as it is safe to do so, we will be encouraging everyone to visit and experience the UK's fantastic cultural offerings again.""Dr Smith, who also hosts the Naked Scientists podcast, is confident we will ultimately return to enjoying such collective experiences - as they ""appeal to the human nature"" - but only after most people in the country have either been infected with the disease (herd immunity), or inoculated (vaccines or combinations of drugs) in some way.In ""the near-term"", he says, ""it's just not going to happen.""""I think this year is basically a write-off, if I'm honest with you,"" he adds.These sobering sentiments were echoed again by former Creation Records and current Creation23 label supremo Alan McGee on Boogaloo Radio on Monday, who said the government ""are never going to allow 200 people to congregate [this year].""""Also nobody is going to want to go to a show at the moment,"" he went on.Theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh declared this week that the West End and Broadway are unlikely to be able to stage musicals until early next year, and the Hay Literature Festival unveiled its first-ever digital programme in lieu of an actual event.But the boss of one of the UK's biggest cinema chains is optimistic the business can reopen in mid-July, noting it can ""control how many people come into"" the building.Vue Cinemas' chief executive Tim Richards told the BBC he is still talking to the authorities about social distancing measures. If all goes to plan, the chain could be back in business for the launch of director Christopher Nolan's action movie Tenet on 17 July, he said.Despite having sympathy for those in the dormant creative industries - many of which Dr Smith fears ""won't ever recover"" from the ""monumental impact"" of coronavirus - he stresses entertainment figures now need to think ""not with their wallet, but with their head screwed on,"" to avoid ""undoing all the great work that has been done"" by the NHS.He suggests it might be conceivable to reopen some art galleries and museums; where people can often move around more freely, using similar social distancing measures and restrictions to those seen at supermarkets.However to do so, even intermittently at smaller gig venues, theatres and cinemas in selected towns and cities, would cause ""carnage"", he predicts.""How on earth would we ever have a system that was enforceable where you said, 'You can go to a rock concert and watch Ed Sheeran but you've got to stand two metres apart?' Everyone would just laugh,"" he says.""You've got to think about the bigger picture, which is how do most people get to and get into the venue [at the same time]? If you suddenly have to start telling people, 'you can't all go to the loo together,' can you imagine the carnage?""A campaign is well under way to save more than 550 UK music venues, many of which have had to furlough staff. Reopening them, or picture houses, anytime soon with restrictions, Dr Smith believes, would cause further financial problems, as well as medical ones.""In the short term, we're going to have to rethink all this because it's just not feasible to say, 'let's just translate this into different numbers',"" he adds. ""Because the economics don't work out for the artists and the venue holders, because those venues work at the capacity that they were built for.""Who would spend a fortune buying the rights to show a film in their cinema if they don't know that their cinema is going to be open next week and that they can actually make their money back?""US bioethicist Dr Zeke Emanuel, from the University of Pennsylvania, who hosts the coronavirus podcast Making the Call, agrees that many people will have to wait longer than they might think before attending big events again.""Larger gatherings - conferences, concerts, sporting events - when people say they're going to reschedule this conference or graduation event for October 2020, I have no idea how they think that's a plausible possibility,"" he told the New York Times last month.""I think those things will be the last to return. Realistically we're talking fall 2021 at the earliest.""Elsewhere, the Isle of Wight Festival boss John Giddings told the NME that cancelling their summer event was ""tragic but a no-brainer"", and that he held little hope for gigs and festivals later in the year. ""Will artists, crews and customers even be able to travel?"" he questioned.In answering these questions, the UK can at least learn lessons from other nations, some of whom are weeks/months ahead on their coronavirus timelines.For instance, on Thursday, in the week that Germany reopened some museums, galleries and gardens with strict social distancing rules (including the use of face masks and in some cases, poles), France announced a bailout for culture workers that will also see similar steps from next week.Neither country has decreed concert halls, cinemas or theatres to be safe zones yet, and president Emmanuel Macron indicated there would be no Gallic gatherings of more than 5,000 people until at least September.Spain - where Primavera Sound Festival is still in the offing - plans to phase ""cultural events"" back in later this month, with indoor venues at one-third capacity, and seated outdoor shows of up to 200.In the US, the New York and LA mayors have both said concerts and festivals were ""difficult to imagine"" until 2021. Missouri governor Mike Parson, however, has given the green light for concerts to begin again as early as Monday. And an Arkansas venue will make gig-goers sit in ""fan pods"" six feet apart at a show next week.Oscar-winning director Spike Lee criticised the governor of Georgia's plan to lift quarantine and reopen movie theatres. When China partially did so, after lockdown restrictions were lifted, it soon had to shut them down again, with the reason thought to be coronavirus-related.Business is apparently booming, meanwhile, at the few drive-in cinemas that remain in the States, and Denmark has introduced drive-in concerts as a workaround.Finally, in Sweden, a controversial Malm√∂ venue has continued to put on socially-distanced shows, capped at audiences of 40, throughout the pandemic.Once borders eventually begin to gradually open up, and testing becomes more readily available to the UK public, Dr Smith believes it may become necessary to prove one's immunity in order to travel through international airports.But he says it would be a ""terrible idea"" to start allowing just those who have immunity back into venues, as it could risk ""coercing"" people into deliberately catching the disease (as has happened, historically, with other viruses like chickenpox). The idea being they would take the risk so that they might become immune and then be able to go out and do things.The practitioner says this would also be ""impossible to police"" at venues. And, of course, it's still not certain if you become immune after contracting Covid-19.While the situation is frighteningly complex and ever-changing, it's not all doom and gloom for entertainment fans.The ""new normal"" for consuming stuff online - like the One World: Together at Home benefit concert, and the upcoming We Are One: A Global Film Festival - Dr Smith concludes, will bring such great technological advances, due to demand, that it will ""make people more comfortable with having a night in"" in the interim.(The owner of Odeon Cinemas wasn't too keen on that idea, banning all Universal films after the studio said it will release new movies at home and on the big screen on the same day).Stufish, who have designed stages for U2, The Rolling Stones and Beyonce, for instance, are looking into how virtual reality could be used to tailor shows for socially-distanced audiences in the future.""It might end up that some gigs are better for it,"" says Dr Smith, ""because you won't be paying Wembley millions of pounds to use their venue and people can engage with you in a way where they will be able to see you.""I'm very grateful we had technology at the stage we had before this happened, because I think it's been our saviour.""",7 May 2020,entertainment

Richard Sambrook to review BBC's social media use,"A former director of global news at the BBC is to review how the corporation maintains impartiality on social media. The BBC has appointed Richard Sambrook, currently director of journalism of Cardiff University, to review online behaviour of programmes and staff.Prof Sambrook, who worked for BBC News for 30 years, will examine whether impartiality guidelines are being adhered to on platforms like Twitter.The review was commissioned before this week's Emily Maitlis controversy.The BBC said: ""As part of our ongoing work on impartiality, we're having an internal look at social media use, and some time ago we asked Richard Sambrook to take an independent view on it for us.

The High Note: Why Tracee Ellis Ross 'only got better with age',"Usually, when a Hollywood star has a new movie coming out, they fly to London for a publicity blitz.They'll often take part in a press junket, which is where the film company hires out an entire floor of an expensive hotel and invites journalists to come and interview them. It's efficient for the actors, because they can knock off several interviews in one day, and in one place. There's usually a lot of hanging around for the journalists - but if you're lucky you get a free Diet Coke and a biscuit while you're waiting.But just like pub quizzes, office meetings and first dates, promoting a new Hollywood movie has moved online to Zoom - where sadly there are no free snacks.At the the launch of the movie The High Note, journalists are shuffled between different virtual meeting rooms, waiting to speak with the film's star Tracee Ellis Ross.Thanks to lockdown, the actress is launching and promoting the movie entirely from her own living room.""It's wonderful, but I miss people,"" Ross tells BBC News. ""I don't have shoes on, so that's nice! I'm at home, that's nice too. But I wouldn't mind seeing you face-to-face and being in your energy, that always makes a difference. But actually, it is nice to be able to do these things even though we're in a pandemic, and to do them safely.""The High Note tells the story of soul singer Grace Davis (Ross) and her assistant Maggie (Fifty Shades star Dakota Johnson), who is an aspiring music producer herself.Grace (who is not to be confused with the 2017 X Factor runner-up Grace Davies) is in the autumn of her career. A pop star over 40, she is no longer having number one hits and her manager is encouraging her to start a Vegas residency to keep the money coming in. The character isn't based on anyone specific - but there are plenty of singers who have followed the Vegas route in real life, including Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Toni Braxton.The role marks the first time Ross has ever been heard singing. And pressure is high - her mother is Motown legend Diana Ross. ""It was my childhood dream, I always wanted to sing,"" she says. ""I didn't put it away, but I think the longer you wait to do certain things the more frightening they get... The idea of comparison because of who my mom is, or the judgement of doing it now at this age, became bigger than the dream. So when this role came along, I was like, 'it's time'.""Ross is best known in the US for starring in TV series including Girlfriends and Black-ish. Her performance in the latter earned her a Golden Globe Award in 2017 for best TV comedy actress. The High Note marks her first on-screen film role since 2009. She says her successful TV career has been ""incredibly fulfilling"", but adds: ""The truth is it's left me little desire to pursue certain things, because I'm tired and I have a full schedule, but it takes something I'm really excited about and then I'm like 'this is it'.""Ross says she was drawn to the message of the story - which she characterises as being about two women, each pursuing their own dream regardless of what others want from them.Notably, the two women are ""not against each other"", as Ross puts it. ""The dynamic that both of us developed was not the characteristic stereotypical schtick between diva and assistant. We were able to find this real friendship connection that was in there, that kind of gave it the right tone.""Flora Greeson's screenplay makes much of Grace's age. One scene sees Grace point to how few singers over 40 still score number one hits, especially female artists.A frustration with ageism is one thing Ross shares with her character. ""What I know is I have only gotten better with age,"" she says. ""I think I'm the sexiest I've ever been, and I'm almost 50. And I think of the other women who are in this age bracket and beyond, and I think, 'why was there ever a message of counting us out?' That seems absurd. ""You think of Jennifer Lopez, Marisa Tomei, the list goes on of extraordinary women, and there's so much to offer at this age. My mom on stage now at 76 is like, I think she's better than she's ever been!""For Ross herself, being in her 40s hasn't stopped her from experiencing the most successful decade of her career.""I don't think youth is everything, I just don't,"" Ross says. ""That wonderful expression 'youth is wasted on the young' is great. I mean there are so many good things about youth, but I don't wanna go back, I'll tell you that right now - I wouldn't go back to my 20s if you paid me.""Early reviews of The High Note - which is directed by Nisha Ganatra - have been largely positive, albeit not glowing. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the film ""does have much to recommend it, at least during these lean times"".""It's the kind of plush, pleasurable comfort viewing that goes down as easily as a favourite artist's hits compilation,"" he added.The Daily Mirror's Lewis Knight said: ""Ultimately, it's a credit to the lead actresses of The High Note that it remains so watchable despite being rather formulaic and containing some predictable plot turns and twists.""The film is one of several which had originally been due to open in cinemas this spring. Most of the others - including Mulan, Fast & Furious 9 and No Time To Die - postponed their release until later in the year, in the hope cinemas will be open again.But some studios have instead decided to release their films online for movie fans to rent at home. Trolls World Tour was the first major film out of the gate to do this, and now The High Note is skipping cinemas too.""I'm actually kind of excited,"" Ross says. ""Don't get me wrong, I wanted to see myself on the big screen as Grace Davis, but I have a pretty big TV screen! I feel like there's something really wonderful and intimate about being able to meet people where they are, in their homes.""I can only speak for myself, and right now I don't know that I wanna go and sit in a movie theatre. That doesn't sound like something I wanna do, I'm happy to watch a movie, right here, on the couch!""Audience trepidation about returning to crowded spaces after the coronavirus pandemic could spell serious financial trouble for cinemas, which are already struggling with the loss of income under lockdown. The industry's future is uncertain, to put it mildly. ""I think normal is going to be reshaped for all of us,"" Ross acknowledges, ""so we can respond to the reality of what we're living in and still have joyful experiences and still receive entertainment and expand our lives by watching these stories in a way that matches the reality of where we are.""The High Note is available to rent from Friday 29 May from digital retailers.",28 May 2020,entertainment
UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale, one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment

Emily Maitlis: I asked for night off from BBC's Newsnight,"Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis has said she did not present the BBC Two programme on Wednesday because she had ""asked for the night off"".She was responding to suggestions that the BBC had replaced her after ruling her introduction about Dominic Cummings on Tuesday broke impartiality rules.The BBC said her wording ""risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides, and expressing an opinion"".But the corporation insisted she had not been removed or suspended.Newsnight's UK editor Katie Razzall presented Tuesday's programme instead.Maitlis tweeted on Thursday morning to say she had been ""overwhelmed by all the kindness, messages - and support on here - and I've probably missed much of it.

But as broadcast, it risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides, and expressing an opinion, rather than being impartial.""It said that 'the country' was 'shocked the government cannot see' Dominic Cummings broke lockdown rules; that he 'made those who struggled to keep the rules feel like fools'.""But there are some who do not share this opinion, nor think that the issue is a 'scandal' or the prime minister has displayed 'blind loyalty'.""By presenting a matter of public and political debate as if the country was unanimous in its view, we consider Newsnight risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides - or that the introduction constituted the presenter's opinions, rather than a summary of the journalism which would follow, which explored these issues rigorously and fairly and, crucially, with the supporting evidence.""Maitlis's introduction also said the ""public mood"" was ""one of fury, contempt and anguish"".She continued: ""The prime minister knows all this.
