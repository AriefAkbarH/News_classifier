The Machine Stops: Will Gompertz reviews EM Forster's work ★★★★★,"My wife was listening to a radio programme the other day and heard a man talking about artificial intelligence. He mentioned a science fiction novella by EM Forster called The Machine Stops, published in 1909. He said it was remarkably prescient. The missus hadn't heard of it, and nor had I. Frankly, we didn't have Forster down as a sci-fi guy, more Merchant Ivory films starring Helena Bonham Carter and elegant Edwardian dresses. We ordered a copy (you can read it for free online).   OMG! as Forster would not have said. The Machine Stops is not simply prescient; it is a jaw-droppingly, gob-smackingly, breath-takingly accurate literary description of lockdown life in 2020. If it had been written today it would be excellent, that it was written over a century ago is astonishing. The short story is set in what must have seemed a futuristic world to Forster but won't to you. People live alone in identikit homes (globalisation) where they choose to isolate (his word), send messages by pneumatic post (a proto email or WhatsApp), and chat online via a video interface uncannily similar to Zoom or Skype. ""The clumsy system of public gatherings had long since been abandoned"", along with touching strangers (""the custom had become obsolete""), now considered verboten in this new civilisation in which humans live in underground cells with an Alexa-like computer catering to their every whim. If it already sounds spookily close for comfort, you won't be reassured to know that members of this detached society know thousands of people via machine-controlled social networks that encourage users to receive and impart second-hand ideas. ""In certain directions human intercourse had advanced enormously"" writes the visionary author drily, before adding later:""But humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and complacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to mean progress of the machine.""It's not lost on me that you are reading this on the internet on a man-made device over which we just about still believe we have mastery. Not for long according to Forster's story, nor, I suspect, some of the boffins behind AI today. We are in Frankenstein's monster territory, another literary warning we probably shouldn't ignore. Forster has no similar scary physical manifestation of science going wrong in The Machine Stops (the title says it all), but that brings it even closer to home. The tale's two protagonists, Vashti and her son Kuno, are normal people, just like you or me. She lives in the southern hemisphere, he lives in the north. Kuno wants his mother to visit. She isn't keen. ""But I can see you!"" she exclaimed. ""What more do you want?""""I want to see you not through the Machine,"" said Kuno. ""I want to speak to you not through the wearisome Machine.""""Oh, hush!"" said his mother, vaguely shocked. ""You mustn't say anything against the Machine.""She prefers social distancing and giving her online lecture on Music During the Australian Period to an unseen armchair audience who lap-up abstract historical information that has absolutely no relevance to their actual subterranean lives beyond being an illusory distraction from their hollowed-out existence (not dissimilar to lectures under lockdown, maybe). I won't say any more about what happens - it is a very short story that can be read in under an hour - other than to mention it is basically a machine-age take on Plato's The Allegory of the Cave. The Machine (or internet for us) is the airless, sunless, solitary cave in which we exist, the information it imparts the shadows on the wall.EM Forster published the story between A Room with a View (1908) and Howard's End (1910), two novels in which he explores similar philosophical themes around inner and outer worlds, truth and pretence. The Machine Stops first appeared in the Oxford and Cambridge Review in the same year as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published his furious Futurist Manifesto in Le Figaro newspaper. The Italian poet was arguing for the very opposite to Forster's prophetic parable.Marinetti embraced the machine, arguing that a speeding car was far more beautiful than an ancient Greek sculpture. The past was a dead weight that needed destroying to make way for the future.He would have liked Vashti, who, when travelling by airship to see Kuno, pulled down her blind over Greece because that was no place to find ideas - an ironic joke by Forster given the idea for his story came from Plato's Athens.  That's about it for jokes in a novella where there really is no such thing as community, or direct experience, and it is impossible to get away from the constant hum of the machine without asking the Central Committee for an Egression-permit to go outside. At which point you strap on a respirator and take your chances in the real world. As the man on the radio said, it's prescient. And very, very good.

Harvey Weinstein: Four more women accuse producer of assault,"Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual assault by four further women as he serves a 23-year prison sentence.Court documents filed in New York on Thursday allege several sexual offences dating from 1984 to 2013.One of the four anonymous women was 17 at the time of an alleged attack.Weinstein's legal representative told BBC News: ""Mr Weinstein intends to defend against the claims filed anonymously against him yesterday.""The lawyer, Imran H Ansari of Aidala, Bertuna & Kamins PC, added: ""Some of these claims, including those alleged to have occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, may be barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and not subject to any exceptions under the law, as these plaintiffs do not appear to be complainants in Mr Weinstein's criminal case."" The latest legal cases allege multiple sexual offences against four women, who currently reside in Tennessee, New York, Ecuador and Hungary.Some of the attacks allegedly took place after meetings with Weinstein at the Cannes and Venice Film Festivals.The new allegations include:Allegations against Weinstein began to emerge in October 2017, when The New York Times first reported incidents dating back decades.At least 80 women have since accused him of sexual misconduct, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Uma Thurman and Salma Hayek.The allegations were at the centre of the #MeToo movement that inspired women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men.Weinstein issued an apology acknowledging he had ""caused a lot of pain"", but denied any allegations of non-consensual sex.In February, Weinstein was convicted in New York City of third-degree rape and first-degree criminal sexual act, and later sentenced to 23 years in jail.",29 May 2020,entertainment

Richard Sambrook to review BBC's social media use,"A former director of global news at the BBC is to review how the corporation maintains impartiality on social media. The BBC has appointed Richard Sambrook, currently director of journalism of Cardiff University, to review online behaviour of programmes and staff.Prof Sambrook, who worked for BBC News for 30 years, will examine whether impartiality guidelines are being adhered to on platforms like Twitter.The review was commissioned before this week's Emily Maitlis controversy.The BBC said: ""As part of our ongoing work on impartiality, we're having an internal look at social media use, and some time ago we asked Richard Sambrook to take an independent view on it for us. ""This is in its early stages and we don't have any further details at the moment.""Sambrook will look at how programmes such as Question Time and Newsnight use social media. Such programmes often share edited clips in isolation on their feeds, without the background or context provided in the full broadcast programme.The BBC's editorial guidelines state: ""Impartiality lies at the heart of public service and is the core of the BBC's commitment to its audiences.""Earlier this week, the BBC said Newsnight's opening monologue, delivered by Emily Maitlis, did not meet impartiality standards.Maitlis said the country was ""shocked"" the government could not see that Boris Johnson's aide Dominic Cummings had broken the rules by travelling from London to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. She added the ""public mood"" was ""one of fury, contempt and anguish"" and that the programme would consider the implications of the prime minister's ""blind loyalty"" to his advisor. A clip of her monologue went viral online. In 2018, Gary Lineker was criticised by fellow sport presenter Jonathan Agnew for expressing his views on Twitter.""Keep your political views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself,"" Agnew said, but Lineker responded by saying he could ""tweet what he likes"" and would continue to do so.However, Lineker works for the corporation as a freelancer.

The BBC has appointed Richard Sambrook, currently director of journalism of Cardiff University, to review online behaviour of programmes and staff.Prof Sambrook, who worked for BBC News for 30 years, will examine whether impartiality guidelines are being adhered to on platforms like Twitter.The review was commissioned before this week's Emily Maitlis controversy.The BBC said: ""As part of our ongoing work on impartiality, we're having an internal look at social media use, and some time ago we asked Richard Sambrook to take an independent view on it for us. ""This is in its early stages and we don't have any further details at the moment.""Sambrook will look at how programmes such as Question Time and Newsnight use social media. Such programmes often share edited clips in isolation on their feeds, without the background or context provided in the full broadcast programme.The BBC's editorial guidelines state: ""Impartiality lies at the heart of public service and is the core of the BBC's commitment to its audiences.""Earlier this week, the BBC said Newsnight's opening monologue, delivered by Emily Maitlis, did not meet impartiality standards.Maitlis said the country was ""shocked"" the government could not see that Boris Johnson's aide Dominic Cummings had broken the rules by travelling from London to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown. She added the ""public mood"" was ""one of fury, contempt and anguish"" and that the programme would consider the implications of the prime minister's ""blind loyalty"" to his advisor. A clip of her monologue went viral online. In 2018, Gary Lineker was criticised by fellow sport presenter Jonathan Agnew for expressing his views on Twitter.""Keep your political views, whatever they are and whatever the subject, to yourself,"" Agnew said, but Lineker responded by saying he could ""tweet what he likes"" and would continue to do so.However, Lineker works for the corporation as a freelancer. As he does not work for BBC News, he is not subject to the same guidelines as journalists.",29 May 2020,entertainment
The High Note: Why Tracee Ellis Ross 'only got better with age',"Usually, when a Hollywood star has a new movie coming out, they fly to London for a publicity blitz.They'll often take part in a press junket, which is where the film company hires out an entire floor of an expensive hotel and invites journalists to come and interview them. It's efficient for the actors, because they can knock off several interviews in one day, and in one place. There's usually a lot of hanging around for the journalists - but if you're lucky you get a free Diet Coke and a biscuit while you're waiting.But just like pub quizzes, office meetings and first dates, promoting a new Hollywood movie has moved online to Zoom - where sadly there are no free snacks.At the the launch of the movie The High Note, journalists are shuffled between different virtual meeting rooms, waiting to speak with the film's star Tracee Ellis Ross.Thanks to lockdown, the actress is launching and promoting the movie entirely from her own living room.""It's wonderful, but I miss people,"" Ross tells BBC News. ""I don't have shoes on, so that's nice! I'm at home, that's nice too. But I wouldn't mind seeing you face-to-face and being in your energy, that always makes a difference. But actually, it is nice to be able to do these things even though we're in a pandemic, and to do them safely.""The High Note tells the story of soul singer Grace Davis (Ross) and her assistant Maggie (Fifty Shades star Dakota Johnson), who is an aspiring music producer herself.Grace (who is not to be confused with the 2017 X Factor runner-up Grace Davies) is in the autumn of her career. A pop star over 40, she is no longer having number one hits and her manager is encouraging her to start a Vegas residency to keep the money coming in. The character isn't based on anyone specific - but there are plenty of singers who have followed the Vegas route in real life, including Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Toni Braxton.The role marks the first time Ross has ever been heard singing. And pressure is high - her mother is Motown legend Diana Ross. ""It was my childhood dream, I always wanted to sing,"" she says. ""I didn't put it away, but I think the longer you wait to do certain things the more frightening they get... The idea of comparison because of who my mom is, or the judgement of doing it now at this age, became bigger than the dream. So when this role came along, I was like, 'it's time'.""Ross is best known in the US for starring in TV series including Girlfriends and Black-ish. Her performance in the latter earned her a Golden Globe Award in 2017 for best TV comedy actress. The High Note marks her first on-screen film role since 2009. She says her successful TV career has been ""incredibly fulfilling"", but adds: ""The truth is it's left me little desire to pursue certain things, because I'm tired and I have a full schedule, but it takes something I'm really excited about and then I'm like 'this is it'.""Ross says she was drawn to the message of the story - which she characterises as being about two women, each pursuing their own dream regardless of what others want from them.Notably, the two women are ""not against each other"", as Ross puts it. ""The dynamic that both of us developed was not the characteristic stereotypical schtick between diva and assistant. We were able to find this real friendship connection that was in there, that kind of gave it the right tone.""Flora Greeson's screenplay makes much of Grace's age. One scene sees Grace point to how few singers over 40 still score number one hits, especially female artists.A frustration with ageism is one thing Ross shares with her character. ""What I know is I have only gotten better with age,"" she says. ""I think I'm the sexiest I've ever been, and I'm almost 50. And I think of the other women who are in this age bracket and beyond, and I think, 'why was there ever a message of counting us out?' That seems absurd. ""You think of Jennifer Lopez, Marisa Tomei, the list goes on of extraordinary women, and there's so much to offer at this age. My mom on stage now at 76 is like, I think she's better than she's ever been!""For Ross herself, being in her 40s hasn't stopped her from experiencing the most successful decade of her career.""I don't think youth is everything, I just don't,"" Ross says. ""That wonderful expression 'youth is wasted on the young' is great. I mean there are so many good things about youth, but I don't wanna go back, I'll tell you that right now - I wouldn't go back to my 20s if you paid me.""Early reviews of The High Note - which is directed by Nisha Ganatra - have been largely positive, albeit not glowing. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the film ""does have much to recommend it, at least during these lean times"".""It's the kind of plush, pleasurable comfort viewing that goes down as easily as a favourite artist's hits compilation,"" he added.The Daily Mirror's Lewis Knight said: ""Ultimately, it's a credit to the lead actresses of The High Note that it remains so watchable despite being rather formulaic and containing some predictable plot turns and twists.""The film is one of several which had originally been due to open in cinemas this spring. Most of the others - including Mulan, Fast & Furious 9 and No Time To Die - postponed their release until later in the year, in the hope cinemas will be open again.But some studios have instead decided to release their films online for movie fans to rent at home. Trolls World Tour was the first major film out of the gate to do this, and now The High Note is skipping cinemas too.""I'm actually kind of excited,"" Ross says. ""Don't get me wrong, I wanted to see myself on the big screen as Grace Davis, but I have a pretty big TV screen! I feel like there's something really wonderful and intimate about being able to meet people where they are, in their homes.""I can only speak for myself, and right now I don't know that I wanna go and sit in a movie theatre. That doesn't sound like something I wanna do, I'm happy to watch a movie, right here, on the couch!""Audience trepidation about returning to crowded spaces after the coronavirus pandemic could spell serious financial trouble for cinemas, which are already struggling with the loss of income under lockdown. The industry's future is uncertain, to put it mildly. ""I think normal is going to be reshaped for all of us,"" Ross acknowledges, ""so we can respond to the reality of what we're living in and still have joyful experiences and still receive entertainment and expand our lives by watching these stories in a way that matches the reality of where we are.""The High Note is available to rent from Friday 29 May from digital retailers.",28 May 2020,entertainment
The Machine Stops: Will Gompertz reviews EM Forster's work ★★★★★,"My wife was listening to a radio programme the other day and heard a man talking about artificial intelligence. He mentioned a science fiction novella by EM Forster called The Machine Stops, published in 1909. He said it was remarkably prescient. The missus hadn't heard of it, and nor had I. Frankly, we didn't have Forster down as a sci-fi guy, more Merchant Ivory films starring Helena Bonham Carter and elegant Edwardian dresses. We ordered a copy (you can read it for free online).   OMG! as Forster would not have said. The Machine Stops is not simply prescient; it is a jaw-droppingly, gob-smackingly, breath-takingly accurate literary description of lockdown life in 2020. If it had been written today it would be excellent, that it was written over a century ago is astonishing. The short story is set in what must have seemed a futuristic world to Forster but won't to you. People live alone in identikit homes (globalisation) where they choose to isolate (his word), send messages by pneumatic post (a proto email or WhatsApp), and chat online via a video interface uncannily similar to Zoom or Skype. ""The clumsy system of public gatherings had long since been abandoned"", along with touching strangers (""the custom had become obsolete""), now considered verboten in this new civilisation in which humans live in underground cells with an Alexa-like computer catering to their every whim. If it already sounds spookily close for comfort, you won't be reassured to know that members of this detached society know thousands of people via machine-controlled social networks that encourage users to receive and impart second-hand ideas. ""In certain directions human intercourse had advanced enormously"" writes the visionary author drily, before adding later:""But humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and complacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to mean progress of the machine.""It's not lost on me that you are reading this on the internet on a man-made device over which we just about still believe we have mastery. Not for long according to Forster's story, nor, I suspect, some of the boffins behind AI today. We are in Frankenstein's monster territory, another literary warning we probably shouldn't ignore. Forster has no similar scary physical manifestation of science going wrong in The Machine Stops (the title says it all), but that brings it even closer to home. The tale's two protagonists, Vashti and her son Kuno, are normal people, just like you or me. She lives in the southern hemisphere, he lives in the north. Kuno wants his mother to visit. She isn't keen. ""But I can see you!"" she exclaimed. ""What more do you want?""""I want to see you not through the Machine,"" said Kuno. ""I want to speak to you not through the wearisome Machine.""""Oh, hush!"" said his mother, vaguely shocked. ""You mustn't say anything against the Machine.""She prefers social distancing and giving her online lecture on Music During the Australian Period to an unseen armchair audience who lap-up abstract historical information that has absolutely no relevance to their actual subterranean lives beyond being an illusory distraction from their hollowed-out existence (not dissimilar to lectures under lockdown, maybe). I won't say any more about what happens - it is a very short story that can be read in under an hour - other than to mention it is basically a machine-age take on Plato's The Allegory of the Cave. The Machine (or internet for us) is the airless, sunless, solitary cave in which we exist, the information it imparts the shadows on the wall.EM Forster published the story between A Room with a View (1908) and Howard's End (1910), two novels in which he explores similar philosophical themes around inner and outer worlds, truth and pretence. The Machine Stops first appeared in the Oxford and Cambridge Review in the same year as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published his furious Futurist Manifesto in Le Figaro newspaper. The Italian poet was arguing for the very opposite to Forster's prophetic parable.Marinetti embraced the machine, arguing that a speeding car was far more beautiful than an ancient Greek sculpture. The past was a dead weight that needed destroying to make way for the future.He would have liked Vashti, who, when travelling by airship to see Kuno, pulled down her blind over Greece because that was no place to find ideas - an ironic joke by Forster given the idea for his story came from Plato's Athens.  That's about it for jokes in a novella where there really is no such thing as community, or direct experience, and it is impossible to get away from the constant hum of the machine without asking the Central Committee for an Egression-permit to go outside. At which point you strap on a respirator and take your chances in the real world. As the man on the radio said, it's prescient. And very, very good.
