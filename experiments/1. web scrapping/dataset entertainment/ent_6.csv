""Narrative is everything.

""If there was another spike [in infections], or actors get ill, we would have to stop again and that would be really damaging.""That doesn't necessarily mean the building will be totally shut until 2021. Featherstone is trying to think of ""creative, socially distanced ways"" to host events, perhaps for young people, in the autumn. ""Something more playful and hopeful, a bit more radical, reckless, for much, much smaller groups of people,"" she explains.As well as thinking about how to make members of the public feel safe, she is preoccupied by the predicaments of the freelancers who work on their shows. All plays that had been announced will go ahead - at some point.""We have a massive freelance and self-employed workforce that I think we have taken for granted.

Sir Cameron Mackintosh: 'Theatres could be closed until next year',"Theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said that West End and Broadway theatres are unlikely to be able to stage musicals until early next year.Speaking to Michael Ball on BBC Radio 2, Sir Cameron said it's impossible for theatres to plan for the future while social distancing is in place.""We want the audience to feel safe, and we want the actors to feel safe.""Theatres in many countries have been closed indefinitely in response to the coronavirus pandemic.In the UK, all West End performances have been cancelled until at least 31 May.Sir Cameron is a lauded theatre owner and theatrical producer, who has staged musicals including Cats, Les Miserables and the Phantom of the Opera.His comments follow calls from other theatre professionals for urgent government bailouts, in order to save the industry from collapse.Sir Cameron told Michael Ball it looked as if the West End and Broadway ""are going to be the last to go back"".""For major producers both sides of the Atlantic, the truth is until social distancing doesn't exist any more, we can't even plan to reopen,"" he said. ""We will be back, but we need time to get back. If we don't hear [about lockdowns lifting] in a few weeks, I think the truth is we won't be able to come back until early next year. I think that's quite clear. ""And the longer it is until we can say social distancing is gone, the longer it'll be for the theatre to come back.""Last month, playwright James Graham said an ""aggressive government bailout"" would be needed to save UK theatres from the impact of the pandemic.In several months' time, ""all of the reserves will have dried up and there will be no money left"", Graham warned.""I don't even know if there will be a theatre or film industry that we can recognise when this is all over.""",4 May 2020,entertainment
Leonardo DiCaprio joins DR Congo gorilla park campaign after attack,"Leonardo DiCaprio has joined a campaign to support Africa's oldest nature reserve after it came under a deadly attack last month.Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo is a popular tourist attraction and is known for its endangered mountain gorilla population. In April, 12 rangers at the park were killed in an ambush by a suspected Rwandan rebel group.DiCaprio has now contributed to a new fund which aims to support the park.Earth Alliance, a group co-founded by the actor, has donated part of the initial $2m (£1.65m) funding, although it is not clear exactly how much.""I had the great honour of meeting and supporting Virunga's courageous team in their fight against illegal oil drilling in 2013,"" DiCaprio said in a statement to BBC News.The actor was an executive producer on the documentary Virunga, which was nominated for an Oscar in 2014.""Virunga urgently needs funds to protect the endangered mountain gorilla population, to provide support to the rangers and the families of rangers who have fallen in the line of duty, and to help deliver essential disease prevention efforts,"" he said.""It's critical that we rally together during this time of incredible crisis.""The park, a Unesco World Heritage site, is one of the most biologically diverse in the world, and his home to several hundred species of birds, reptiles and mammals.On Monday, the park launched the Virunga Fund, made up of donations from groups including Earth Alliance, which was co-founded by DiCaprio, Emerson Collective and Global Wildlife Conservation. The European Commission have also contributed.Virunga Park said it was facing a ""series of unprecedented threats"". In addition to the recent attack on rangers, the coronavirus outbreak has forced it to close to tourists, resulting in a significant loss of revenue.Scientists have also said Covid-19 poses an ""existential threat"" to the gorillas themselves.The World Wide Fund For Nature has warned that mountain gorillas are at risk of catching coronavirus because they share 98% of their DNA with humans.A month after Virunga stopped all tourism activities, 12 park rangers, a driver and four members of the local community were killed in a violent attack by around 60 militiamen.The group ambushed a convoy of civilians that was being protected by the rangers. A statement from the park at the time described it as an attack on the local civilian population, adding that the rangers were not the target. Kidnappers have previously been known to target tourists in the park. In 2018 attackers killed park ranger Rachel Masika Baraka during the brief kidnapping of two British tourists and their driver. National Virunga Park director Emmanuel De Merode said he had ""never been more worried"" about the future of the park in light of the outbreaks of Ebola and Covid-19.""Virunga's rangers are racing against the clock to protect both the local communities that surround the park and the endangered mountain gorilla population from these twin threats,"" he said.The park said money raised would provide urgent support for staff on the ground to deliver critical disease prevention efforts, law enforcement, and protect endangered species. DiCaprio has become well known for his activism in recent years, particularly on environmental issues. In 2016 he appeared in Before The Flood, a documentary that saw him meet scientists and world leaders to discuss the dangers of climate change.Last month he helped launch America's Food Fund, a fundraising initiative that aims to ensure all US citizens have access to a reliable supply of food. It has raised $26m (£21.4m) so far.The 45-year-old became one of the world's best-known actors in the late 1990s after appearing in Titanic and Romeo + Juliet.He has since starred in The Wolf of Wall Street, The Departed and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.

Just Sam: American Idol crowns first ever 'at home' winner,"American Idol's 18th winner, Just Sam, celebrated alone on Sunday after taking part in the finale under lockdown in Los Angeles.Samantha Diaz, 21, from Harlem, New York, was told she'd won the public vote by host Ryan Seacrest, who was broadcasting from his garage.She heard the news while clutching an iPad that was connected to a call with her grandmother, who brought her up.""Can I thank America now?"" asked the singer. ""My dreams have come true.""End of Youtube post  by American IdolAmerican Idol has soldiered on through the coronavirus pandemic, with the flashy neon sets and pyrotechnics replaced by gardens, garages and bedrooms.Just Sam relocated from New York to LA for the live stages of the singing contest. When the show started filming remotely due to the pandemic, she faced a tough choice - either return to Harlem or remain alone in quarantine in LA.In the end, she chose the latter for her grandmother's safety.""I get to stay in California so that my grandmother could be OK and so I don't risk getting her sick,"" she said on the show. ""I don't have much, just my two suitcases that I had packed about two months ago.""Over the weeks, Just Sam captured viewers' hearts with her emotional back story, vivacious personality and soul-stirring vocals.Formerly a subway singer in New York, she broke down in tears while auditioning for the show in Washington DC last year, before stunning the judges with a stirring performance of Andra Day's Rise Up.End of Youtube post 2 by American IdolThe singer had a tough upbringing. With her mother in jail, she spent time in foster care before being adopted at the age of six by her Liberian grandmother, Elizabeth.""She made sure we were fed, she made sure we had a roof over our head, she made sure we had clothes on our backs,"" she told American Idol.She took on her stage name at high school after being bullied over her appearance.""In high school, they didn't know which category to put me in,"" she said in one episode. ""I wasn't a girl, not a boy, but both. And I'm like, 'Just Sam - it sounds perfect. I think I'm going to use that as my stage name forever.'""In the final, she faced stiff competition from Arthur Gunn, a Nepalese-American singer whose gritty rock vocals made him one of the favourites to win.But Sam's powerful rendition of Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You), by the first ever Idol winner Kelly Clarkson, and an emotional reprise of Day's Rise Up earned her the public vote.Rise Up will be released as her first single on Monday.""My grandmother has been saying that she doesn't believe that people like us can have their dreams come true,"" she said during the show. ""This is proof to her!""End of Youtube post 3 by American IdolThe contestants and judges (Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie) were each sent a makeshift rig consisting of three iPhones, a tripod and a ring light to film their segments.The production team, also in their own homes, advised on camera angles and backdrops, and the resulting footage was edited remotely.For the finale, contestants were also provided with a confetti cannon, with each of the final five pre-recording one song and performing the other live.""We put the show together earlier in the week because there are so many factors to it,"" Seacrest told People magazine. ""It's technically not possible to do it all live obviously. ""Every once in a while we have to be careful not to step on each other while we're talking because there's that delay that we've all experienced talking to our families at home on different Zooms and things like that.""Elsewhere in Sunday's show, Perry performed her new single Daisies, while Oscar nominee Cynthia Erivo delivered a medley of Aretha Franklin hits.The finale ended with a performance of the 1985 charity anthem We Are The World, led by co-writer Lionel Richie and his fellow judges.Just Sam also joined the chorus, alongside an all-star group of Idol alumni - including Jordin Sparks, Fantasia, Katharine McPhee, Ruben Studdard and Scotty McCreery - whose faces were virtually projected onto some of America's most famous landmarks.End of Youtube post 4 by American IdolSpeaking to Billboard, executive producer Trish Kinane, said some of the changes forced upon the team this season would influence next year's show.""We're starting to think about auditions in a serious way now,"" Kinane said. ""All our big, open calls where you have thousands of people, I guess we're not going to be able to do that.""Filming contestants at home could become a more regular feature.""When we've been announcing the results to contestants these past few weeks, they're at home in a familiar environment with their family and the emotion... has been extraordinary and you don't get that in the big studio,"" she said. ""We're certainly going to be looking at the emotion that these moments have produced, and how do we capture that again?""We've been forced into it, but I think it's revealed something rather stripped-back and back to the origins of what Idol was.""",18 May 2020,entertainment

""Scenes will be about the lockdown, so people will be isolating. Scenes will be shot more simply with less people.""Obviously cameras and booms will be placed where there's the required distance. So it's all going to be very, very different when we do get back.""However, Roache, 88, added that older residents of the street would not return immediately for health reasons.""Senior members of the cast will not be called back for some time, sadly. I'd like to get back,"" he said.Among the measures recommended in the 15-page guidelines are:The guidelines also urge caution over high-risk scenarios involving stunts or special effects, saying producers should consider the ""potential demands on emergency services"".Mental health is also addressed, with producers advised to schedule down-time, along with access to support.Although some TV shows have continued to film during the lockdown, most major productions have been shut down. Last week, the BBC said production would restart on Top Gear and EastEnders by the end of June, while plans are also being drawn up to resume shoots on other independently-produced shows.""We can only move forward with the right safety measures in place,"" said BBC director general Tony Hall.

Shakespeare's Globe theatre calls for urgent funds to avoid insolvency,"Shakespeare's Globe Theatre has called for urgent funding to avoid going out of business due to the ""devastating"" impact of the coronavirus pandemic.The London venue has been shut since 20 March and has warned MPs it is ""critically vulnerable and at risk of closure in the wake of Covid-19"".It said it would need at least £5m to get back up and running.It was ineligible for Arts Council England's relief and said it had been ""left without any emergency support"".In evidence to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, the theatre said: ""Without emergency funding and the continuation of the coronavirus job retention scheme, we will spend down our reserves and become insolvent.""This has been financially devastating and could even be terminal.""Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the committee, said in a letter to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden that it would be a ""tragedy"" if the theatre was to close.""Shakespeare's Globe is a world-renowned institution and not only part of our national identity, but a leading example of the major contribution the arts make to our economy,"" he wrote.""For this national treasure to succumb to Covid-19 would be a tragedy.""The Globe does not get annual funding from Arts Council England (ACE), meaning it can't access ACE's main £90m emergency relief fund.It said it was also turned down for a slice of a £50m pot for organisations outside the ACE annual funding regime.Instead, the Globe raises 95% of its revenue through ticket sales, guided tours, education workshops, retail and catering - which all depend upon the venue being open to the public.The theatre has now warned it faces the ""biggest threat to its future since opening in 1997"". Shakespeare's Globe, a replica of an Elizabethan playhouse, has played host to actors including Sir Ian McKellen, Christopher Plummer, Dame Judi Dench, Jude Law, Ralph Fiennes and David Tennant.""We are a model for the non-subsidised arts sector that is well-run, well-managed and financially resilient, but in the face of a crisis such as this one, there is no mechanism to help us,"" it said.""In a crisis such as this one, ACE has been unable to support an organisation of our size and scale.""As an organisation that contributes so much to the UK's cultural life, that delivers public benefit, and that stewards one of the most important, recognised and well-loved buildings in the country, we would hope that we have earned the right to be supported in return through this crisis.""It is one of a number of submissions to the select committee from individuals and organisations across the UK about the threat posed to the cultural landscape and workforce.

'We're clinging on' - theatre leaders discuss lockdown turmoil,"Theatres will be among the last places to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown is lifted, meaning venues, actors and crews are fearing for their futures.The appeal of the theatre - cramming into an enclosed space with hundreds of strangers to share a communal experience - has suddenly become its greatest risk.Box office takings have dried up virtually overnight. Reopening with social distancing will not make financial sense. One venue, the Nuffield in Southampton, has already gone into administration.Below, four artistic directors discuss how and when they might reopen, and warn of dire consequences if income and funding dry up.The theatre industry is badly wounded, according to Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah's analogy. ""Right now we're at the tourniquet stage,"" he says. ""We're trying to stem the bleeding.""Then we're going to have to stand up, and then we're going to have to run. And we're going to need help at each stage in order to get back to - not even the way it was, but to get back to something that is sustainable and safe.""He believes the south London venue and others like it have enough money to keep going until the autumn. Arts Council England has made £90m of emergency funding available to keep organisations afloat until the end of September.After that, they will need a government bailout. Without one ""many of us will fall off a cliff"" in the subsequent months, Kwei-Armah explains.The key to reopening will be an end to social distancing. ""It's almost impossible economically to socially distance a theatre,"" he says.""In order to social distance at 2m, we would lose three quarters of our audience. And then we have to work out how you create safe space for the rest of the staff - backstage and in a rehearsal room.""And then we have to work out what the public appetite might be towards coming back into a theatre.""It will then take three months to get back up and running, taking staffing and rehearsals into account, he adds.The Young Vic is planning different reopening scenarios up to next April - more than a year after going dark.The venue has furloughed most staff but has continued some work - reaching 100 members of its young directors scheme online every day, and running a local playwriting programme. Staff are also making food deliveries for a local charity.When theatres do turn the lights back on, Kwei-Armah says those who have often been excluded in the past must be present.""From class to race to gender, we have made great progress over the last few years in our sector in trying to equalise it,"" he says.""I'm determined absolutely that all of that progress that we've made cannot go for naught. We have to rebuild with that as a fundamental.""The Young Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire will be streamed by the National Theatre from 21 May.Coronavirus hasn't stopped the youth and elders groups at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre making a show together - they have just done it online.The five episodes of Connect Fest, about an ageing band reforming for a festival, are being released daily this week.""We're still trying to do what we are here to do, which is to give people moments of connection through art,"" says joint artistic director Roy Alexander Weise.""It's hard, though, because the team who are producing that piece of work has been cut down because we've had to furlough close to 90% of our staff to help keep ourselves afloat financially, because we aren't making the money that we would do.""When the venue does eventually reopen, Weise and co-artistic director Bryony Shanahan are also thinking about socially-distanced shows.""It doesn't necessarily make financial sense for us to do that,"" he says. ""But we understand that our purpose is greater than financial gain. It is far greater - it's connection, wellbeing, equal opportunities.""So I guess, just like everyone else, we're clinging on for dear life trying to see what will happen next, and all we can do is prepare ourselves as best we can to brace for whatever the landscape looks like.""Producing shows is going to feel incredibly difficult to do in the coming months.""End of Youtube post  by rxtheatreHow will the pandemic change theatre? Weise says many people are afraid of ""a huge regression"" in the types of plays and voices heard, seeking refuge in ""plays that they know will sell"".He goes so far as to say some think ""it might be a good thing for some institutions to go"" - venues that ""for a very long time have been led by lots of people who all look the same, who invite the same audiences in.""He's focusing on his theatre's purpose and why it stages the shows it does. ""We've all got more than enough time now to think about our why as artistic leaders.""The current hiatus is a chance to prepare for allowing a wider range of people to tell their stories, he says. ""Narrative is everything.

""Something more playful and hopeful, a bit more radical, reckless, for much, much smaller groups of people,"" she explains.As well as thinking about how to make members of the public feel safe, she is preoccupied by the predicaments of the freelancers who work on their shows. All plays that had been announced will go ahead - at some point.""We have a massive freelance and self-employed workforce that I think we have taken for granted.

Sir Cameron Mackintosh: 'Theatres could be closed until next year',"Theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said that West End and Broadway theatres are unlikely to be able to stage musicals until early next year.Speaking to Michael Ball on BBC Radio 2, Sir Cameron said it's impossible for theatres to plan for the future while social distancing is in place.""We want the audience to feel safe, and we want the actors to feel safe.""Theatres in many countries have been closed indefinitely in response to the coronavirus pandemic.In the UK, all West End performances have been cancelled until at least 31 May.Sir Cameron is a lauded theatre owner and theatrical producer, who has staged musicals including Cats, Les Miserables and the Phantom of the Opera.His comments follow calls from other theatre professionals for urgent government bailouts, in order to save the industry from collapse.Sir Cameron told Michael Ball it looked as if the West End and Broadway ""are going to be the last to go back"".""For major producers both sides of the Atlantic, the truth is until social distancing doesn't exist any more, we can't even plan to reopen,"" he said.

'We're clinging on' - theatre leaders discuss lockdown turmoil,"Theatres will be among the last places to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown is lifted, meaning venues, actors and crews are fearing for their futures.The appeal of the theatre - cramming into an enclosed space with hundreds of strangers to share a communal experience - has suddenly become its greatest risk.Box office takings have dried up virtually overnight. Reopening with social distancing will not make financial sense. One venue, the Nuffield in Southampton, has already gone into administration.Below, four artistic directors discuss how and when they might reopen, and warn of dire consequences if income and funding dry up.The theatre industry is badly wounded, according to Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah's analogy. ""Right now we're at the tourniquet stage,"" he says. ""We're trying to stem the bleeding.""Then we're going to have to stand up, and then we're going to have to run. And we're going to need help at each stage in order to get back to - not even the way it was, but to get back to something that is sustainable and safe.""He believes the south London venue and others like it have enough money to keep going until the autumn. Arts Council England has made £90m of emergency funding available to keep organisations afloat until the end of September.After that, they will need a government bailout. Without one ""many of us will fall off a cliff"" in the subsequent months, Kwei-Armah explains.The key to reopening will be an end to social distancing. ""It's almost impossible economically to socially distance a theatre,"" he says.""In order to social distance at 2m, we would lose three quarters of our audience. And then we have to work out how you create safe space for the rest of the staff - backstage and in a rehearsal room.""And then we have to work out what the public appetite might be towards coming back into a theatre.""It will then take three months to get back up and running, taking staffing and rehearsals into account, he adds.The Young Vic is planning different reopening scenarios up to next April - more than a year after going dark.The venue has furloughed most staff but has continued some work - reaching 100 members of its young directors scheme online every day, and running a local playwriting programme. Staff are also making food deliveries for a local charity.When theatres do turn the lights back on, Kwei-Armah says those who have often been excluded in the past must be present.""From class to race to gender, we have made great progress over the last few years in our sector in trying to equalise it,"" he says.""I'm determined absolutely that all of that progress that we've made cannot go for naught. We have to rebuild with that as a fundamental.""The Young Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire will be streamed by the National Theatre from 21 May.Coronavirus hasn't stopped the youth and elders groups at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre making a show together - they have just done it online.The five episodes of Connect Fest, about an ageing band reforming for a festival, are being released daily this week.""We're still trying to do what we are here to do, which is to give people moments of connection through art,"" says joint artistic director Roy Alexander Weise.""It's hard, though, because the team who are producing that piece of work has been cut down because we've had to furlough close to 90% of our staff to help keep ourselves afloat financially, because we aren't making the money that we would do.""When the venue does eventually reopen, Weise and co-artistic director Bryony Shanahan are also thinking about socially-distanced shows.""It doesn't necessarily make financial sense for us to do that,"" he says. ""But we understand that our purpose is greater than financial gain. It is far greater - it's connection, wellbeing, equal opportunities.""So I guess, just like everyone else, we're clinging on for dear life trying to see what will happen next, and all we can do is prepare ourselves as best we can to brace for whatever the landscape looks like.""Producing shows is going to feel incredibly difficult to do in the coming months.""End of Youtube post  by rxtheatreHow will the pandemic change theatre? Weise says many people are afraid of ""a huge regression"" in the types of plays and voices heard, seeking refuge in ""plays that they know will sell"".He goes so far as to say some think ""it might be a good thing for some institutions to go"" - venues that ""for a very long time have been led by lots of people who all look the same, who invite the same audiences in.""He's focusing on his theatre's purpose and why it stages the shows it does. ""We've all got more than enough time now to think about our why as artistic leaders.""The current hiatus is a chance to prepare for allowing a wider range of people to tell their stories, he says. ""Narrative is everything. It really does rule the world.""We have a real opportunity to allow people to understand the power of story, allow people to step into some of that power, who maybe haven't been able to step into that power before, and see the exciting ways in which our world can progress.""When the Royal Court shut in March, it put the words ""Back Soon"" up in big letters on the front of its building in west London. But how soon?""We keep coming up with different scenarios for when we could open and how we could open, and we alight on one thing, and then that slips,"" artistic director Vicky Featherstone says.""The closest I can imagine being able to invite a full capacity audience is around January.""It's too risky to commit the money for a big production before that. ""If there was another spike [in infections], or actors get ill, we would have to stop again and that would be really damaging.""That doesn't necessarily mean the building will be totally shut until 2021. Featherstone is trying to think of ""creative, socially distanced ways"" to host events, perhaps for young people, in the autumn. ""Something more playful and hopeful, a bit more radical, reckless, for much, much smaller groups of people,"" she explains.As well as thinking about how to make members of the public feel safe, she is preoccupied by the predicaments of the freelancers who work on their shows. All plays that had been announced will go ahead - at some point.""We have a massive freelance and self-employed workforce that I think we have taken for granted. And now we need to think about how they are supported.""Most of the theatre's education and outreach work has continued digitally, and it has put David Ireland's play Cyprus Avenue online. The Royal Court website is now showing a live feed of the empty theatre.End of Youtube post  by royalcourttheatreTheatres play a crucial role, she says, citing research that (in normal times) more people go to theatres than to Premier League football matches. They are also where many people in film and TV learn their craft.Featherstone points to Alice Birch, who came through the Royal Court's ranks before co-writing BBC Three's hit drama Normal People.""We all need stories and we all need our imaginations to be fired up,"" Featherstone says. ""From Shakespeare onwards, we have absolutely led the world. We want to be able to continue that.""Pitlochry Festival Theatre in the Scottish Highlands has postponed its summer season, which had been due to start next week.But artistic director Elizabeth Newman has been busy organising activities, like a phone line for actors to have chats with lonely locals; three daily rays of ""Light Hope Joy"" on social media; and 50 works of art dedicated to the River Tay.One of the summer shows, David Greig's new play Adventures with the Painted People, is being made for BBC Radio 3 instead.""We've tried to remain a producing organisation that is making art,"" Newman says.

In April, 12 rangers at the park were killed in an ambush by a suspected Rwandan rebel group.DiCaprio has now contributed to a new fund which aims to support the park.Earth Alliance, a group co-founded by the actor, has donated part of the initial $2m (£1.65m) funding, although it is not clear exactly how much.""I had the great honour of meeting and supporting Virunga's courageous team in their fight against illegal oil drilling in 2013,"" DiCaprio said in a statement to BBC News.The actor was an executive producer on the documentary Virunga, which was nominated for an Oscar in 2014.""Virunga urgently needs funds to protect the endangered mountain gorilla population, to provide support to the rangers and the families of rangers who have fallen in the line of duty, and to help deliver essential disease prevention efforts,"" he said.""It's critical that we rally together during this time of incredible crisis.""The park, a Unesco World Heritage site, is one of the most biologically diverse in the world, and his home to several hundred species of birds, reptiles and mammals.On Monday, the park launched the Virunga Fund, made up of donations from groups including Earth Alliance, which was co-founded by DiCaprio, Emerson Collective and Global Wildlife Conservation. The European Commission have also contributed.Virunga Park said it was facing a ""series of unprecedented threats"". In addition to the recent attack on rangers, the coronavirus outbreak has forced it to close to tourists, resulting in a significant loss of revenue.Scientists have also said Covid-19 poses an ""existential threat"" to the gorillas themselves.The World Wide Fund For Nature has warned that mountain gorillas are at risk of catching coronavirus because they share 98% of their DNA with humans.A month after Virunga stopped all tourism activities, 12 park rangers, a driver and four members of the local community were killed in a violent attack by around 60 militiamen.The group ambushed a convoy of civilians that was being protected by the rangers. A statement from the park at the time described it as an attack on the local civilian population, adding that the rangers were not the target. Kidnappers have previously been known to target tourists in the park. In 2018 attackers killed park ranger Rachel Masika Baraka during the brief kidnapping of two British tourists and their driver. National Virunga Park director Emmanuel De Merode said he had ""never been more worried"" about the future of the park in light of the outbreaks of Ebola and Covid-19.""Virunga's rangers are racing against the clock to protect both the local communities that surround the park and the endangered mountain gorilla population from these twin threats,"" he said.The park said money raised would provide urgent support for staff on the ground to deliver critical disease prevention efforts, law enforcement, and protect endangered species.

With her mother in jail, she spent time in foster care before being adopted at the age of six by her Liberian grandmother, Elizabeth.""She made sure we were fed, she made sure we had a roof over our head, she made sure we had clothes on our backs,"" she told American Idol.She took on her stage name at high school after being bullied over her appearance.""In high school, they didn't know which category to put me in,"" she said in one episode.

""I don't have much, just my two suitcases that I had packed about two months ago.""Over the weeks, Just Sam captured viewers' hearts with her emotional back story, vivacious personality and soul-stirring vocals.Formerly a subway singer in New York, she broke down in tears while auditioning for the show in Washington DC last year, before stunning the judges with a stirring performance of Andra Day's Rise Up.End of Youtube post 2 by American IdolThe singer had a tough upbringing. With her mother in jail, she spent time in foster care before being adopted at the age of six by her Liberian grandmother, Elizabeth.""She made sure we were fed, she made sure we had a roof over our head, she made sure we had clothes on our backs,"" she told American Idol.She took on her stage name at high school after being bullied over her appearance.""In high school, they didn't know which category to put me in,"" she said in one episode. ""I wasn't a girl, not a boy, but both. And I'm like, 'Just Sam - it sounds perfect. I think I'm going to use that as my stage name forever.'""In the final, she faced stiff competition from Arthur Gunn, a Nepalese-American singer whose gritty rock vocals made him one of the favourites to win.But Sam's powerful rendition of Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You), by the first ever Idol winner Kelly Clarkson, and an emotional reprise of Day's Rise Up earned her the public vote.Rise Up will be released as her first single on Monday.""My grandmother has been saying that she doesn't believe that people like us can have their dreams come true,"" she said during the show. ""This is proof to her!""End of Youtube post 3 by American IdolThe contestants and judges (Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie) were each sent a makeshift rig consisting of three iPhones, a tripod and a ring light to film their segments.The production team, also in their own homes, advised on camera angles and backdrops, and the resulting footage was edited remotely.For the finale, contestants were also provided with a confetti cannon, with each of the final five pre-recording one song and performing the other live.""We put the show together earlier in the week because there are so many factors to it,"" Seacrest told People magazine. ""It's technically not possible to do it all live obviously. ""Every once in a while we have to be careful not to step on each other while we're talking because there's that delay that we've all experienced talking to our families at home on different Zooms and things like that.""Elsewhere in Sunday's show, Perry performed her new single Daisies, while Oscar nominee Cynthia Erivo delivered a medley of Aretha Franklin hits.The finale ended with a performance of the 1985 charity anthem We Are The World, led by co-writer Lionel Richie and his fellow judges.Just Sam also joined the chorus, alongside an all-star group of Idol alumni - including Jordin Sparks, Fantasia, Katharine McPhee, Ruben Studdard and Scotty McCreery - whose faces were virtually projected onto some of America's most famous landmarks.End of Youtube post 4 by American IdolSpeaking to Billboard, executive producer Trish Kinane, said some of the changes forced upon the team this season would influence next year's show.""We're starting to think about auditions in a serious way now,"" Kinane said. ""All our big, open calls where you have thousands of people, I guess we're not going to be able to do that.""Filming contestants at home could become a more regular feature.""When we've been announcing the results to contestants these past few weeks, they're at home in a familiar environment with their family and the emotion... has been extraordinary and you don't get that in the big studio,"" she said. ""We're certainly going to be looking at the emotion that these moments have produced, and how do we capture that again?""We've been forced into it, but I think it's revealed something rather stripped-back and back to the origins of what Idol was.""",18 May 2020,entertainment
Green screens and social distancing - TV industry publishes guidelines to resume filming,"Actors will have to stand 2m apart and film in front of green screens more often when TV shows resume, according to new guidance.The measures form part of a back-to-work blueprint issued by the UK's biggest broadcasters on Monday.They have been adopted by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky to protect actors and crews during the pandemic.It is hoped that soaps including EastEnders and Coronation Street will start filming again in June.William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in Corrie, told BBC Radio Derby on Monday that cast members had been told filming should re-start in mid-June.""They've said it's all going to be very, very different,"" he said. ""Scenes will be about the lockdown, so people will be isolating. Scenes will be shot more simply with less people.""Obviously cameras and booms will be placed where there's the required distance. So it's all going to be very, very different when we do get back.""However, Roache, 88, added that older residents of the street would not return immediately for health reasons.""Senior members of the cast will not be called back for some time, sadly. I'd like to get back,"" he said.Among the measures recommended in the 15-page guidelines are:The guidelines also urge caution over high-risk scenarios involving stunts or special effects, saying producers should consider the ""potential demands on emergency services"".Mental health is also addressed, with producers advised to schedule down-time, along with access to support.Although some TV shows have continued to film during the lockdown, most major productions have been shut down. Last week, the BBC said production would restart on Top Gear and EastEnders by the end of June, while plans are also being drawn up to resume shoots on other independently-produced shows.""We can only move forward with the right safety measures in place,"" said BBC director general Tony Hall. ""This guidance is an attempt to get that right.""ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall said: ""ITV has been at the heart of informing, entertaining and connecting the UK through the Covid-19 crisis.""Our production teams are now working hard to bring many more much loved shows back for viewers.""The new guidelines were welcomed by the government, with Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden calling them ""a significant step forward in getting our favourite shows back into production"".",18 May 2020,entertainment
Tributes to 'vibrant' director Lynn Shelton after her death at 54,"Reese Witherspoon, Alison Brie, Mindy Kaling and Ava DuVernay have paid tribute to director Lynn Shelton, who has died at the age of 54.Shelton, known for indie films like Humpday and her TV work on Glow and Mad Men, died from complications from a previously unidentified blood disorder.Witherspoon, who Shelton directed in Little Fires Everywhere, said she was ""vibrant, talented and soulful"".Glow star Brie said it was ""such a shocking and devastating loss"".Kaling, who worked with Shelton on The Mindy Project, said her ""sunny energy was infectious"". Shelton's partner Marc Maron, who starred in her 2019 movie Sword of Trust, said in a statement that her death was not connected to Covid-19.""I loved her very much as I know many of you did as well. It's devastating,"" he said.""I am levelled, heartbroken and in complete shock and don't really know how to move forward in this moment. I needed you all to know.""She was a beautiful, kind, loving, charismatic artist. Her spirit was pure joy. She made me happy. I made her happy. ""We were happy. I made her laugh all the time. We laughed a lot. We were starting a life together. I really can't believe what is happening. This is a horrendous, sad loss.""Shelton started directing relatively late at the age of 39, and made her directorial debut at the Sundance Film Festival in 2006 with We Go Way Back.It was her second feature film, Humpday, starring Mark Duplass and Joshua Leonard, that made her name. She later worked again with Duplass on the movie Your Sister's Sister, also starring Emily Blunt and Rosemarie Dewitt, and also on Outside In.Duplass praised her ""energy"" and ""infectious spirit"".Her work often showcased unconventional women, such as Keira Knightley's character in the movie Laggies (also known as Say When in the UK) and Edie Falco in the film Outside In.She also directed episodes of TV shows like The Morning Show, The Good Place and New Girl.Director Edgar Wright, who made Hot Fuzz and Baby Driver, said she was ""a friend, a kind heart, so talented & only just getting started, despite her stellar work so far"".Selma director DuVernay wrote: ""Thank you for your films. And for your kindness.""",18 May 2020,entertainment
How live entertainment is evolving online to be a lifeline in lockdown,"From gigs to plays and quizzes, live entertainment has moved online during coronavirus lockdown - and creative minds are coming up with new ideas to give us back some of the human connection we've lost.Every Saturday for the past two months, Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has sat down and written a song.Well, he has co-written a song - with 5,000 fans on Instagram.He asks them for chords, comes up with melodies, and puts them to a vote. He then asks for ideas for lyrics before coming back an hour later with a finished track. ""Some are really good,"" he says. End of Youtube post  by Snow PatrolLightbody also performs solo online gigs from home, but wanted to do something more collaborative too.""You can say absolutely anything in this. It's therapeutic and cathartic for me,"" he explains.""In a 'gig', I chat a little bit, but you can't really read the comments because you're playing songs. But with this, it feels like you're engaging with everybody.""The fans also vote for the set lists in his regular online concerts. ""I could just choose a bunch of songs that I want to play, which I did do one week and it just didn't really work,"" Lightbody says. ""It just felt a little disconnected.""I miss playing live, I do. But it's going to be a long time, so this is what we've got.""With the communal thrill of congregating in the same room currently out of the question, Lightbody is among the artists to have come up with interesting ways to bring people together.When his Saturday Songwrite sessions have generated 10 or 12 decent tracks, he'll release an album for charity - although he hasn't settled on a charity yet. ""It might be best to put that to a vote as well.""Few musicians haven't done online performances, which can have an intimate charm (but can also be quite dull, beyond the voyeuristic kick of having a nosey in their houses).Lightbody recommends fellow Northern Irish singer Roe, who could teach the bigger names a thing or two about audio and video quality.This was filmed in isolation with Jay Dickson on the drums. We thought this would be a cool thing to do right now seeing...End of Facebook post  by ROESome performers get their fans involved - whether by taking requests or doing Q&As, virtual charity festivals or tutorials like Duran Duran star John Taylor with his bass masterclasses and Oti Mabuse with her dance lessons.Listening parties have also been a big hit. Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess has carved out a sideline as host of #timstwitterlisteningparty. Fans and musicians listen together in real time, tweeting their thoughts and memories.""There's power in listening and knowing others are doing so at the same as you,"" Burgess told The Sunday Times.In the US, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland - who staged a song-for-song producer clash in 2018 - now run a regular lockdown face-off, inviting different stars to go head-to-head in weekly Verzuz battles on Instagram.Erykah Badu and Jill Scott's recent battle was more of a love-in, and drew 700,000 live viewers.The New York Times has called Verzuz ""perhaps the most powerful quarantine-friendly entertainment franchise going"".Last night's #VERZUZ was special ✨ Thank you @fatbellybella and @missjillscott 🙏@Timbaland @THEREALSWIZZZ pic.twitter.com/8iOLySRompEnd of Twitter post  by @verzuzonlineBeyond music, lockdown may turn out to be a tipping point for activities like quizzes, choirs, and exercise, yoga and cookery lessons, which have found new leases of life online (despite the inevitable loss of the human touch).In theatre, as in music, it's hard to replicate the live experience on screen. But some are using technology to create a new kind of show.Although monologues have been filmed in lockdown and pre-recorded shows have been put online, they often can't capture the excitement of being in an audience. Plus, the magical, fantastical storytelling of theatre doesn't translate well to the screen.""What doesn't work is watching streaming of plays on computers,"" playwright Simon Stephens told BBC Radio 4's Front Row last week. ""Whenever I watch those I just feel lonelier than I felt before.""What is interesting is when writers, directors, actors and designers start thinking about - what are the dramatic potentials of Zoom?""In recent weeks, creative types have been exploring just that.David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman and Denise Gough starred in A Separate Peace, a one-act play by Sir Tom Stoppard on Zoom.""I'm fascinated by the format, which is a completely new kind of way of putting on a play where paradoxically you stay home and live theatre comes to you,"" Sir Tom said.The show tried to replicate something of the live experience, with audience members buying a ticket in advance and turning up at an allotted time - the performance deliberately wasn't put online to watch afterwards.It had professional crew, including video, lighting, costume and sound designers, and the actors (all at home, obviously) entered and exited their quarters of the screen as they would a stage. ""The cast were saying they were so nervous, like 'I really felt like I was standing in the wings,'"" says producer Matt Humphrey.""We want to show other people that this can be done and give confidence to other people that live theatre still has a place during lockdown."" And he believes such Zoom-style shows will still have a place when quarantine lifts.The Guardian's five-star review declared: ""If, for however long, this is live theatre's future, then it works triumphantly.""Another Zoom theatre triumph got the audience fully involved from their sofas.In a playful version of The Tempest from Northern Ireland-based theatre company Big Telly and Oxford's Creation Theatre, viewers were asked to help out by doing things like making storm sound effects and pretending to be a flock of birds. The most enthusiastic were spotlighted on screen for the rest of the audience to see.Another show, Operation Elsewhere, was originally ""an immersive theatre game"" played in the real world.  When the world locked down, it was hastily reworked for Zoom - also with lots of audience participation.""People turn all the lights off and get under blankets because we need cover of darkness,"" Big Telly artistic director Zoe Seaton explains. ""There was one point where a character says, 'If you've got war paint get it on now', and you see people rushing to the kitchen and getting ketchup and things.""End of Youtube post  by Big TellyVirtual backgrounds and green screens can create settings and effects that would be difficult and expensive in real life. ""I'm really enjoying it because it feels like a new box of tricks, a new way of telling stories,"" Seaton says.People have been tuning in from around the world and using the shows to have a shared night ""out"" with separated family members.""The joy of seeing your nephew and niece in Canada doing something in the same show that you're part of has just been amazing,"" Seaton says. ""We're interested in taking that further.""We work in rural communities in Ireland mostly, as well as Belfast and Derry, and suddenly our audience are in Brooklyn, and you think, oh gosh!""The key has been inviting the audience to bring the shows to life, Seaton adds. ""They have had that sense of community that theatre has, where you're all on the same journey. ""That's their main success. I think that's what people are missing in lockdown - that sense of community.""",18 May 2020,entertainment
The Night Watch: Will Gompertz reviews the Rijksmuseum's high tech photo ★★★★★,"At 9am on Tuesday the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam posted an image of Rembrandt's The Night Watch (1642) on its website. Nothing particularly unusual about that, you might think. After all, the museum frequently uploads pictures of its masterpieces from Dutch Golden Age. But there was something about this particular photo that made it stand out just like the little girl in a gold dress in Rembrandt's famous group portrait of local civic guardsmen. The web image presents the painting unframed on a dark grey background. It looks sharp and well-lit but not exceptional in terms of photography. Until, that is, you click on it, at which point you're zoomed in a bit closer. Click again and you're propelled towards the outstretched hand of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq. Another click, and you're face-to-face with the leader of this group of not-so-merry-men. Once more, and you can see the glint in his eye and the texture of his ginger beard. At no point does the image start to pixelate or distort, it's pin-sharp throughout. And it remains so as you continue to click, getting further and further into the painting until the Captain's paint-cracked eyeball is the size of a fist, and you realise that tiny glint you first saw isn't the result of one dab of Rembrandt's brush, but four separate applications, each loaded with a slightly different shade of paint. And then you stop and think: Crikey, Rembrandt actually used four different colours to paint a minuscule light effect in the eye of one of the many life-sized protagonists featured in this group portrait, which probably wouldn't be seen by anybody anyway. Or, maybe, this visionary 17th Century Dutchman foresaw a future where the early experiments with camera obscura techniques, in which he might have dabbled, would eventually lead to a photographic technology capable of recording a visual representation of his giant canvas to a level of detail beyond the eyesight of even the artist himself! It is, quite frankly, amazing.  For instance, I've always liked the ghostly dog that turns and snarls at the drummer situated at the edge of the painting. I'd assumed the hound was unfinished and therefore unloved by Rembrandt, but now I can see by zooming in that the artist not only gave the dog a stylish collar, but also added a gold pendant with a tiny flash of red paint to echo the colour of the trousers worn by the drummer. Clearly, Rembrandt was pro-dogs.As always there is artifice behind the art, as you will see within moments of zooming into The Night Watch. It quickly becomes apparent that Rembrandt first created his wonderfully dynamic composition, and then fine-tuned it as he went along. You will spot lots of small shadowy corrections (pentimenti) he made, such as the top of the drummer's stick on the far right, or on the index finger of the Ensign holding the Troop's flag aloft. There is artifice in the photograph, too. It is not a single image as it appears, but a composite of 528 individual digital photographs that have been seamlessly stitched together to give us a completely new view of one the most famous paintings in western art.Let's zoom out for a moment. Rembrandt signed, dated and called his painting:  Officers and Men of the Amsterdam Kloveniers Militia, the Company of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq.It was a commissioned portrait by the Kloveniers Militia (a sort of Dad's Army of locals) to hang in their HQ. Those featured (probably 18 members originally) each paid to be included. Capt Cocq takes centre stage, with his trusty Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch to his side. The men gathered behind them are carrying an assortment of weapons with which to defend their neighbourhood. Muskets (Klover) were their speciality, a point Rembrandt illustrates with a surreal sequence running left to right across the picture featuring three musketeers. The first, dressed in red with white collar and cuffs, is loading his musket with gunpowder. The second, a young boy, partially obscured by Cocq's right arm, fires his gun, ruffling the feathers of Ruytenburch's hat but not the man himself, who one has to assume is stone deaf. And then, there's the third, an older man also dressed in red, blowing away the spent powder from the fired gun. The young girl in the gold dress is not a member of the militia, but is there as their shining symbolic mascot. The upturned feet of the dead chicken hanging from her belt represent the Kloveniers' golden claw emblem. The painting initially hung with several other huge group portraits, giving visitors to the troops' inner sanctum the sense of being surrounded by local muscle. It was subsequently moved in 1715 to the Town Hall on the Dam (now the Royal Palace), where it was trimmed on all four sides to fit between the doors. It was first called The Night Watch in 1897, when the varnish applied to protect the paint had become so old and stained the picture looked like a nocturnal scene. That layer of varnish was removed long ago in one of the 25 or more restorations and treatments The Night Watch has undergone over the years. The most memorable being in 1975 after a visitor to the museum attacked the painting with a knife, causing severe damage, traces of which you can see when you zoom in on the new composite photograph: An act of art historical sleuthing which is the digital photo's primary purpose. The 44.8 Gigapixel image was created for the Rijksmuseum's conservation department, which is currently embarked upon the most exhaustive facelift The Night Watch has probably ever endured.  It enables the team of 12 to look right into the picture without using microscopes, in order to see what work needs to be done. A huge amount is the answer. Zoom in and you'll detect plenty of cracked paint, which is to be expected. But zero in on the Captain's and Lieutenant's faces and you will notice they're covered in blackheads. That's not because they didn't know one end of a bath from the other - they were sophisticated chaps - it is probably down to aging white paint particles, the tops of which have broken off to reveal a dark inner. There are thousands of these pinprick blemishes, all of which conservators should be able to reverse, bringing an even greater liveliness to an already lively painting. The Night Watch is an incredible work of art. Soon, you will be able to stand in front of it once again when the Rijksmuseum re-opens on the 1 June (caveat: there will be vastly reduced number of admissions, and The Night Watch is currently encased in a glass box - still visible but not as approachable).  And if and when you do see it for real, you will immediately notice Rembrandt's exaggerated use of light and shade to create a sense of drama, aided and abetted by an all-action composition emphasised by teaming diagonal lines. The Night Watch is as close to theatre as a painting can get. As the director of the Rijksmuseum said, it is a school photo taken before everybody is lined up in order (it shows Capt. Cocq instructing Lt. Ruytenburch to bring his men to attention). It captures a moment of movement and mayhem.You can see that when in front of the canvas. But when you are not, when you're at home, you can now see the same sense of chaos in the way Rembrandt painted his masterpiece, made when he was at the peak of his fame, just at the time his beloved wife was dying and his life took a turn for the worse. The further you look into it the greater the mess appears to be. Splodges of impasto paint here, unfinished transitions there. It's a mixture of early Rembrandt tautness and late Rembrandt looseness. If you thought Van Gogh or Jackson Pollock invented expressionistic painting, you'll think again when you've zoomed into The Night Watch. It is a sight to behold. A magnificent sight, which extends our knowledge of a truly great work of art, whether you're an old timer or a first timer. New technology is often used to try to jazz up old art, which is generally a bad idea. But, the Rijksmuseum is using technology to increase our understanding and appreciation of a Golden Age great, and that is a good idea. As you can see.

How some stars are helping music's unsung heroes in lockdown,"Whether they're guitar players, backing vocalists or studio engineers, career musicians struggle with pay even in regular times. Many take on extra work to make ends meet when their services aren't needed on stage or in the studio.For them, the Covid-19 pandemic has been a double whammy. Not only have tours and recording sessions been put on hold, but those second jobs in wedding bands or school classrooms have vanished, too.According to a Musicians Union survey, 92% of its members have seen their livelihood affected by coronavirus, losing an estimated £13.9m in earnings in the first two weeks of the lockdown.Meanwhile, the Ivors Academy of songwriters and composers said it anticipated a loss of £25,000 per member over a six-month period.The figures may come as a surprise, given recent headlines about record-breaking royalty payments and Rihanna's £468m fortune, but the wealth in the music industry tends to accumulate at the top.For the rest, the ""industry has ground to a halt,"" says Olga FitzRoy, an award-winning engineer and producer whose credits include Coldplay, Foo Fighters and The Beatles.""I did my last session in the first week of March and I've had nothing since then, and my colleagues are pretty much in the same boat,"" she tells the BBC. ""There's no money coming in"".In the midst of the pandemic, however, some artists are finding ways to support their sidemen and women - and hoping they can establish new precedents along the way.In Paris, jazz artist Melody Gardot is making a new record from her apartment, and inviting musicians from around the world to form her ""virtual orchestra"".Anyone can sign up - and they'll receive musical charts, backing tracks and instructions with on how to record themselves performing at home.Crucially, however, she is paying standard union rates to anyone who appears on the finished record. ""The reality is I can't do what I do without those musicians,"" the Grammy nominee tells the BBC.""If I stand on stage by myself, it's way less interesting than if I have a beautiful array of colours to offer. So these people are equally important and we can't forget about them during this time."" I want to contribute something unique to this new movement of ‘connection despite distance’. During this complicated time, we miss essential connections with one other.  We miss hugs, we miss our family, our friends......in short we miss love. So I want to make a love project to help break the feeling of isolation between us. Join me in the first step of this new project “From Paris with Love” by submitting the following: 1. Film a 5 second “video-portrait”, of yourself.  Film it HORIZONTALLY, and make sure we can see enough of you (chest to head) and with a fixed camera (it’s like taking a picture but 5 seconds long and in video format). Dont move too much :) Just pose and record with some natural light in front of a *NEUTRAL BACKGROUND* wearing *SOLID BLACK OR WHITE* tee shirt only please. 2. HANDWRITTEN horizontally, using a large black sharpie or black crayon on a white piece of paper (standard A4 format suggested) say “From (wherever you are) With Love”. Scan or photograph the paper (highest quality possible) and send ! 3. SEND both items (your photo scan and your video) to the email address : frompariswithloveproject@gmail.com **In your email please include your Instagram handle (if you have one) so we can find you later. After receiving these things, we’ll put together a surprising collaborative video clip featuring all your submissions alongside a new piece of music called “From Paris with Love”. A large portion my royalties from this song will be donated to a Covid relief charity to help medical workers during this time. This way, we share as much love as we possibly can together. **Please remember if you send this along it means you’re okay for me to for use your image in this project, so think about breaking the ‘quarantine pijama’ uniform if you don’t want everybody to see you that way ! Your mom and mine will see this ;) Full T&Cs here https://decca.lnk.to/termsandconditions We’re only collecting these over the next few days - so please don’t wait too long. Feel free to pass this message along. This is just the first step of this collaborative journey so stay tuned..... ❤️ With love, from Paris Frompariswithloveproject@gmail.comA post shared by  Melody Gardot (@melodygardotofficial) on Apr 29, 2020 at 8:31am PDTEnd of Instagram post  by melodygardotofficialSo far, Gardot has received submissions from players in ""Croatia, Santa Monica, France and England,"" ranging from top-level professionals to ""an 11-year-old girl who really wants to be a musician"".Her song, With Love From Paris, is a sumptuous, melancholy ballad whose refrain - ""maybe one day I will see you soon"" - pre-dates the lockdown, but has taken on added resonance over the last eight weeks.She decided to ask out-of-work musicians to complete the track after recalling the long weekends she would spend playing piano bars in Philadelphia as a teenager.""I remember playing gigs for food, just to get dinner,"" she remembers. "" Then it got a little better and I do the gig to get 25 bucks and then 50. I was hustling, you know? And I know musicians are in that place right now. ""They don't know how they're going to get by, they need to put some bread on the table, and all of a sudden, not only can they contribute [to this song], doing something they love, but at the end of the day, there's a pay check coming in.""Gardot isn't the only artist leveraging her influence to help others. Pop star Charli XCX has spent the last six weeks recording a new album from scratch in her house - partly to keep herself sane, but also because she realised her regular collaborators would be struggling to make ends meet.""There are a lot of other creative people who can't work during this time,"" she told the BBC last month. ""So, for me, doing this project is also a way to support some of those people, whether that be video editors, or the painters who are doing my artwork, or 3D designers, or video directors.""Indie band The National are donating all profits from their merchandise store to their road crew; while Good Charlotte's Joel and Benji Madden have re-tooled their e-commerce site Veeps to help other bands raise money.The site, which started out as a way to market VIP packages for concert tours, now allows artists to sell tickets to streaming online gigs. So far, it's been embraced by musicians like Angel Olsen, Bat For Lashes and All Time Low, who've used the income to support their touring crew, raise money for charity or offset lost earnings.Typically, the artists are those who can't afford to stage pro-bono live-streams on Instagram - or who are wary of Facebook and Spotify's ""tipping"" systems, which can both produce varying results.All of these ideas are all still taking shape, but they're going to prove crucial if the industry is to survive.Gardot says she hopes other artists will follow her lead in paying musicians for recording their parts at home.""We got to get some of the big cats on board, like John Mayer or Ed Sheeran, and keep creating opportunities for other people,"" she says.That could be crucial, says FitzRoy, as it could be a long time before things return to normal. Although recording studios could re-open in June, with an initial backlog of work to get through, the picture is a little less rosy further down the line.""There's no live work, so a lot of artists won't have had any income, so they won't be able to afford to make records,"" she says. ""And the fact that film production has ground to a halt means that, in six months' time, those projects that should have been recording scores at the big studios just won't be happening.""So there'll be a little bump of activity when things resume, but the longer-term effects are going to be with us for the next couple of years.""Echoing calls made by UK Music earlier this week, FitzRoy says the government should work closely with the industry to make sure it survives as the UK emerges from lockdown.""The music industry makes a lot of money for them in the good times,"" she says.

Shakespeare's Globe theatre calls for urgent funds to avoid insolvency,"Shakespeare's Globe Theatre has called for urgent funding to avoid going out of business due to the ""devastating"" impact of the coronavirus pandemic.The London venue has been shut since 20 March and has warned MPs it is ""critically vulnerable and at risk of closure in the wake of Covid-19"".It said it would need at least £5m to get back up and running.It was ineligible for Arts Council England's relief and said it had been ""left without any emergency support"".In evidence to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, the theatre said: ""Without emergency funding and the continuation of the coronavirus job retention scheme, we will spend down our reserves and become insolvent.""This has been financially devastating and could even be terminal.""Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the committee, said in a letter to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden that it would be a ""tragedy"" if the theatre was to close.""Shakespeare's Globe is a world-renowned institution and not only part of our national identity, but a leading example of the major contribution the arts make to our economy,"" he wrote.""For this national treasure to succumb to Covid-19 would be a tragedy.""The Globe does not get annual funding from Arts Council England (ACE), meaning it can't access ACE's main £90m emergency relief fund.It said it was also turned down for a slice of a £50m pot for organisations outside the ACE annual funding regime.Instead, the Globe raises 95% of its revenue through ticket sales, guided tours, education workshops, retail and catering - which all depend upon the venue being open to the public.The theatre has now warned it faces the ""biggest threat to its future since opening in 1997"". Shakespeare's Globe, a replica of an Elizabethan playhouse, has played host to actors including Sir Ian McKellen, Christopher Plummer, Dame Judi Dench, Jude Law, Ralph Fiennes and David Tennant.""We are a model for the non-subsidised arts sector that is well-run, well-managed and financially resilient, but in the face of a crisis such as this one, there is no mechanism to help us,"" it said.""In a crisis such as this one, ACE has been unable to support an organisation of our size and scale.""As an organisation that contributes so much to the UK's cultural life, that delivers public benefit, and that stewards one of the most important, recognised and well-loved buildings in the country, we would hope that we have earned the right to be supported in return through this crisis.""It is one of a number of submissions to the select committee from individuals and organisations across the UK about the threat posed to the cultural landscape and workforce. The Theatres Trust anticipates the closure of a significant proportion of theatres and a lasting impact on the UK's position as a world leader in the sector.Nuffield Southampton Theatres, which employs 80 staff, was formed in 1964 and has already gone into administration.A government spokesperson said: ""We are providing unprecedented support for the cultural sector, including the job retention scheme, a years' business rates holiday, and the Arts Council's £160m emergency response package.""We're now working closely with the industry to plan for the future and, as soon as it is safe to do so we will be encouraging everyone to get out and experience the UK's fantastic theatrical and cultural offerings again.""Arts Council England has been contacted for comment.",18 May 2020,entertainment

""Scenes will be about the lockdown, so people will be isolating. Scenes will be shot more simply with less people.""Obviously cameras and booms will be placed where there's the required distance. So it's all going to be very, very different when we do get back.""However, Roache, 88, added that older residents of the street would not return immediately for health reasons.""Senior members of the cast will not be called back for some time, sadly. I'd like to get back,"" he said.Among the measures recommended in the 15-page guidelines are:The guidelines also urge caution over high-risk scenarios involving stunts or special effects, saying producers should consider the ""potential demands on emergency services"".Mental health is also addressed, with producers advised to schedule down-time, along with access to support.Although some TV shows have continued to film during the lockdown, most major productions have been shut down. Last week, the BBC said production would restart on Top Gear and EastEnders by the end of June, while plans are also being drawn up to resume shoots on other independently-produced shows.""We can only move forward with the right safety measures in place,"" said BBC director general Tony Hall. ""This guidance is an attempt to get that right.""ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall said: ""ITV has been at the heart of informing, entertaining and connecting the UK through the Covid-19 crisis.""Our production teams are now working hard to bring many more much loved shows back for viewers.""The new guidelines were welcomed by the government, with Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden calling them ""a significant step forward in getting our favourite shows back into production"".",18 May 2020,entertainment
