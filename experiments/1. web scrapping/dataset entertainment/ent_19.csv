Glee star Lea Michele loses sponsorship deal after co-star's claims,"HelloFresh has cut ties with Lea Michele after the US actress was accused of making one of her former Glee co-star's life ""a living hell"".The meal-kit firm said it took Samantha Ware's claims ""very seriously"" and had ended its partnership with Michele.Ware accused Michele of ""traumatic microaggressions"" after Michele posted a tweet about George Floyd's death.Michele has not responded to the claims on social media and her representatives have yet to comment.The actress, who played Rachel Barry on all six seasons of Glee, is currently expecting her first child with husband Zandy Reich.The death of Mr Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May while in police custody has prompted widespread protests and unrest in the US.Protests began after a video showed the 46-year-old African-American pinned to the ground by a white police officer kneeling on his neck.""George Floyd did not deserve this,"" wrote Michele on 29 May. ""This was not an isolated incident and it must end. #BlackLivesMatter.""Her tweet prompted a robust response from Ware, who accused Michele of conduct that had made her ""question a career in Hollywood"".""Remember when you made my first television gig a living hell?!?!"" Ware wrote on Twitter. ""Cause I'll never forget.""The actress went on to accuse Michele of stating publicly she would have defecated in Ware's wig had she had the opportunity.Ware played Jane Hayward in Glee's sixth and final season and has since been seen in Netflix series What/If.Another co-star, Amber Riley, appeared to acknowledge Ware's claims by posting a gif of herself drinking tea on Twitter.HelloFresh said they were ""disheartened and disappointed"" to learn of Ware's claims about Michele, who was paid to promote its services on social media.""HelloFresh does not condone racism nor discrimination of any kind,"" it wrote on Twitter after another user questioned its association with the actress.Founded in 2011, HelloFresh is one of the largest meal-kit providers in the US and operates in a number of other countries.Earlier this year the German company announced plans to expand its UK workforce by 50% to cope with demand.Michele's other shows include Scream Queens and The Mayor. She has also released two solo albums and a Christmas record.",3 June 2020,entertainment
Peter Crouch on jumping from planes and 'the ultimate retirement',"When Peter Crouch made his debut as a TV football pundit in 2014, he got a bit of a shock.""I went to India for a week to do the World Cup as a pundit. I thought I'd cut my cloth out there,"" he recalled on That Peter Crouch Podcast last year. ""We were in Mumbai, and on my first appearance I was with Mikaël Silvestre and a Bollywood star.""We had a little rehearsal and [the producer] said, 'Right, so the game's about to start, we'll be live in 10 minutes. Here's the touchscreen, so when you use the touchscreen at half time...' and I was like, 'Excuse me?'""Crouch was completely unfamiliar with how to use the device - which allows pundits to freeze-frame moments from the game and draw on-screen graphics to highlight players and analyse strategies.""I was dropped into that situation thinking, 'How have I got myself into this position where I'm live to two billion people with a Bollywood star and Mikaël Silvestre, with a touchscreen I've never used before?!'""Needless to say, when the show went live ""there was a lot of buttons that I didn't use... I went with a couple of bendy arrows and moving players"".Fortunately, Crouchy is feeling better prepared for his new TV series - Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer - which begins on BBC One this Saturday. He's got some help too, in the shape of co-presenters Maya Jama and comedian Alex Horne. Unusually for a TV show at the moment, all the presenters will be in the same studio - albeit socially distanced.The show was originally intended to be a post-match series for Euro 2020 but, of course, football matches were among the many events postponed or cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""The Euros got cancelled, Glastonbury got cancelled, the Olympics are cancelled, Wimbledon cancelled... It's not been a great summer has it?"" says Crouch.""So we thought we needed to bring smiles to people's faces, so instead of it being around the Euros, we tried to make it around all those things.""The format has now morphed into a wider Saturday night show fusing sport, music and entertainment.""Some of the people that were supposed to be at the Olympics have kindly signed up, and we've got a tournament going on,"" Crouch explains. ""We've got people playing live gigs, and some amazing guests.""I think it'll take people's minds off what's been going on. It's going to be good fun.""In his professional career, Crouch played a total of 468 Premier League matches for Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa, Southampton, Liverpool, Portsmouth, Stoke City and Burnley.Before retiring last July, the striker had scored 108 goals in the top flight, of which 53 were scored with his head - a Premier League record.But, like many retired footballers before him, he's now transitioning into a successful broadcast career.While Dion Dublin has been presenting Homes Under The Hammer and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has become one of the BBC's biggest stars, Crouch has built a hugely successful podcast with co-hosts Tom Fordyce and Chris Stark. That Peter Crouch Podcast from 5 Live is into its fourth series, and was the most downloaded BBC podcast in the first quarter of this year. In 2019, the show racked up 12 million downloads, despite only releasing 15 new episodes.You may have seen the trailers for Save Our Summer, which feature several ""two-metre Peters"" - cardboard cut-outs of the footballer which came in extremely useful when applying social distancing rules during rehearsals.Asked what attracted him to the show, Horne jokes it was ""mainly Crouchy's beauty"", but adds the new format could be an improvement on the original idea.""I actually think not having the football in it is going to make it a lot better, because we now don't have to talk about the home nations' disappointing performances,"" he laughs.""Yeah we've ruined enough summers, to be honest,"" Crouch admits.Horne continues: ""It's great to have a live band in the studio. There aren't enough shows with actual bands playing live - it's basically Strictly and that's it. So it's a really good atmosphere in there. ""And obviously we don't have an audience but we don't really need it, because there's nine of us before the guests come on. So it feels great in there, really fun and summery.""For Jama, who recently announced her departure from Radio 1, it's a chance to return to her roots.""I actually started as a football presenter... so I thought we were going to do sporty fun [on the show],"" she says.""But obviously my first love is music and entertainment, so when I found out that it was changing and we were going to be able to have everything in one, and on Saturday night, I was like: 'Obviously. Of course.'""Halfway through the press launch for Save Our Summer, Crouch has to pause briefly to restore order in the house. ""Can you see this?"" he asks. ""The dog's run in, there's mud all over the carpet, all the kids have come in, Ab [wife Abbey Clancy] is going mental. And I'm in the posh living room. Apologies, carry on.""Back on track - Crouch explains that some elements of the series were filmed pre-lockdown. ""Part of the show is me doing the ultimate retirement,"" he says. ""I've been taking a few ex-team-mates who have retired as well to do things we couldn't do when we were playing, and the first one I did with JJ [former Tottenham team-mate Jermaine Jenas] was jumping out of a plane. ""I felt confident the whole way through and as soon as we got to jumping out, that's when I started losing it. When I jumped out, I've never been so cold. My feet were like blocks of ice and it sort of took away the enjoyment of the whole process.""He adds: ""In some ways, I hope this show never gets commissioned again, because I've been close to death on a few occasions. It's not been fun, it's been excruciating at times, and jumping out of a plane was one of them.""One of the main benefits of getting in front of the camera, he adds, has been keeping himself busy at a time when many retired players feel at a loose end.""I was so scared about retiring from football. You hear stories about people struggling and sitting there not having much to do, watching Loose Women,"" he says.""And listen, I love Loose Women, but I didn't want to sit there and have not a lot to do. So I took on a few things, and the things I've taken on are only things I enjoy doing.""Which, in the case of his new TV show, hopefully won't involve too many touchscreens.Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer begins on BBC One at 21:15 BST on Saturday.",3 June 2020,entertainment

Peter Crouch on jumping from planes and 'the ultimate retirement',"When Peter Crouch made his debut as a TV football pundit in 2014, he got a bit of a shock.""I went to India for a week to do the World Cup as a pundit. I thought I'd cut my cloth out there,"" he recalled on That Peter Crouch Podcast last year. ""We were in Mumbai, and on my first appearance I was with Mikaël Silvestre and a Bollywood star.""We had a little rehearsal and [the producer] said, 'Right, so the game's about to start, we'll be live in 10 minutes. Here's the touchscreen, so when you use the touchscreen at half time...' and I was like, 'Excuse me?'""Crouch was completely unfamiliar with how to use the device - which allows pundits to freeze-frame moments from the game and draw on-screen graphics to highlight players and analyse strategies.""I was dropped into that situation thinking, 'How have I got myself into this position where I'm live to two billion people with a Bollywood star and Mikaël Silvestre, with a touchscreen I've never used before?!'""Needless to say, when the show went live ""there was a lot of buttons that I didn't use... I went with a couple of bendy arrows and moving players"".Fortunately, Crouchy is feeling better prepared for his new TV series - Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer - which begins on BBC One this Saturday. He's got some help too, in the shape of co-presenters Maya Jama and comedian Alex Horne. Unusually for a TV show at the moment, all the presenters will be in the same studio - albeit socially distanced.The show was originally intended to be a post-match series for Euro 2020 but, of course, football matches were among the many events postponed or cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""The Euros got cancelled, Glastonbury got cancelled, the Olympics are cancelled, Wimbledon cancelled... It's not been a great summer has it?"" says Crouch.""So we thought we needed to bring smiles to people's faces, so instead of it being around the Euros, we tried to make it around all those things.""The format has now morphed into a wider Saturday night show fusing sport, music and entertainment.""Some of the people that were supposed to be at the Olympics have kindly signed up, and we've got a tournament going on,"" Crouch explains. ""We've got people playing live gigs, and some amazing guests.""I think it'll take people's minds off what's been going on. It's going to be good fun.""In his professional career, Crouch played a total of 468 Premier League matches for Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa, Southampton, Liverpool, Portsmouth, Stoke City and Burnley.Before retiring last July, the striker had scored 108 goals in the top flight, of which 53 were scored with his head - a Premier League record.But, like many retired footballers before him, he's now transitioning into a successful broadcast career.While Dion Dublin has been presenting Homes Under The Hammer and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has become one of the BBC's biggest stars, Crouch has built a hugely successful podcast with co-hosts Tom Fordyce and Chris Stark. That Peter Crouch Podcast from 5 Live is into its fourth series, and was the most downloaded BBC podcast in the first quarter of this year. In 2019, the show racked up 12 million downloads, despite only releasing 15 new episodes.You may have seen the trailers for Save Our Summer, which feature several ""two-metre Peters"" - cardboard cut-outs of the footballer which came in extremely useful when applying social distancing rules during rehearsals.Asked what attracted him to the show, Horne jokes it was ""mainly Crouchy's beauty"", but adds the new format could be an improvement on the original idea.""I actually think not having the football in it is going to make it a lot better, because we now don't have to talk about the home nations' disappointing performances,"" he laughs.""Yeah we've ruined enough summers, to be honest,"" Crouch admits.Horne continues: ""It's great to have a live band in the studio. There aren't enough shows with actual bands playing live - it's basically Strictly and that's it. So it's a really good atmosphere in there. ""And obviously we don't have an audience but we don't really need it, because there's nine of us before the guests come on. So it feels great in there, really fun and summery.""For Jama, who recently announced her departure from Radio 1, it's a chance to return to her roots.""I actually started as a football presenter... so I thought we were going to do sporty fun [on the show],"" she says.""But obviously my first love is music and entertainment, so when I found out that it was changing and we were going to be able to have everything in one, and on Saturday night, I was like: 'Obviously. Of course.'""Halfway through the press launch for Save Our Summer, Crouch has to pause briefly to restore order in the house. ""Can you see this?"" he asks. ""The dog's run in, there's mud all over the carpet, all the kids have come in, Ab [wife Abbey Clancy] is going mental. And I'm in the posh living room. Apologies, carry on.""Back on track - Crouch explains that some elements of the series were filmed pre-lockdown. ""Part of the show is me doing the ultimate retirement,"" he says. ""I've been taking a few ex-team-mates who have retired as well to do things we couldn't do when we were playing, and the first one I did with JJ [former Tottenham team-mate Jermaine Jenas] was jumping out of a plane. ""I felt confident the whole way through and as soon as we got to jumping out, that's when I started losing it. When I jumped out, I've never been so cold. My feet were like blocks of ice and it sort of took away the enjoyment of the whole process.""He adds: ""In some ways, I hope this show never gets commissioned again, because I've been close to death on a few occasions. It's not been fun, it's been excruciating at times, and jumping out of a plane was one of them.""One of the main benefits of getting in front of the camera, he adds, has been keeping himself busy at a time when many retired players feel at a loose end.""I was so scared about retiring from football. You hear stories about people struggling and sitting there not having much to do, watching Loose Women,"" he says.""And listen, I love Loose Women, but I didn't want to sit there and have not a lot to do. So I took on a few things, and the things I've taken on are only things I enjoy doing.""Which, in the case of his new TV show, hopefully won't involve too many touchscreens.Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer begins on BBC One at 21:15 BST on Saturday.",3 June 2020,entertainment

The Infinite Monkey Cage: BBC radio show trials virtual audience,"This week, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the BBC has recorded its first programme with a live audience listening from home. Could this be the new normal for radio comedy shows? ""Can you give us a cheer so we know you're there? That's great! Now can you laugh as if I just said something really hilarious?""It's Monday evening, and Radio 4 producer Sasha Feachem is warming up the audience ahead of a recording of science comedy show The Infinite Monkey Cage.But we, the audience, are not in the BBC's radio theatre as we normally would be. Instead we've tuned in over Zoom to hear a new episode of the programme being recorded virtually. For the next hour or so, it's our job to react to whatever the panellists are saying - starting with a quick sound check that sees us clapping, cheering and (fake) laughing.Behaving as if you're a member of a big crowd when you're sitting at home feels strange. But there's no doubt it adds something we've all been missing from comedy programmes recently - namely, atmosphere.""That was wonderful,"" presenter Robin Ince says as the programme gets going. ""The idea that there are loads of people sitting alone in their house just applauding, and everyone in their street is going 'Oh my god, is it 8pm on Thursday already?'""The Infinite Monkey Cage is the perfect show on which to test out a virtual audience. You can imagine the show's dedicated fans being delighted to take part in a recording which is itself an experiment.Furthermore, it won't be a major disaster if it doesn't work. Because Monkey Cage is a science programme and not exclusively a comedy show, there isn't the constant reliance on laughter there would be on The Now Show, Dead Ringers or Just A Minute. Ince and co-host Brian Cox tell the at-home audience the episode will combine space, genetics and archaeology, with guests including comedian Sara Pascoe, biological anthropologist Alice Roberts and archaeologist Sarah Parcak.And with that, we're off.The panellists rattle through topics including Ancient Egypt, undiscovered civilisations in Africa and how much Neanderthal DNA is present in humans today. All the guests appear on screen as part of a group Zoom meeting - with the audience represented, appropriately, by an image of an empty auditorium.But in every other way, it's just like a normal episode of The Infinite Monkey Cage.As audience members we can hear each others' reactions to what the panel says, which itself encourages us to laugh or clap more. We can't see each other, so it's not clear how many of us there are. But even a crowd with fewer than 100 people in it is enough to add some much-needed pace and momentum. There's only one technical hitch in the whole recording, which comes just as Parcak is discussing early erotic poetry.""One of my favourite things to do if I'm teaching an archaeology class around Valentine's Day is to read ancient Egyptian love poetry - and it will turn your ears purple,"" she laughs.""It's incredibly erotic, they were extraordinarily expressive of love. They talk about having their hearts broken, cheating husbands, the same stuff we read today - it's glorious.""At this point, producer Sasha has to interrupt the recording briefly to fix a technical problem with one of the microphones.""Isn't that typical!"" jokes Ince. ""Just as we get to the filth. Typical BBC, isn't it?""Fortunately things get back on track and Parcak picks up with a tale of some of the earliest recorded pornography.You can hear the audience laughing heartily as she describes Egyptian papyrus that featured drawings of dancing lions or cats playing games on one side and erotic drawings on the other.""That's essentially the internet now - it's half porn and half cats playing the piano,"" jokes Pascoe, prompting much laughter from the virtual crowd.This recording is the first proper attempt by the BBC to recreate what live comedy used to be like, before the coronavirus pandemic. Some comedy programmes have struggled to maintain their usual momentum recently, including Have I Got News For You and The Graham Norton Show. While the quality of the writing and the interviews on these recent episodes may be as strong as ever, the jokes still fall flat when met with the sound of silence. And so, depending on what the finished product is like once it's edited, Monkey Cage could provide a blueprint of how comedy shows will sound for the next few months or more. The episode we attend on Monday, which will be released as a podcast next week, lasts a little over an hour and will be chopped down to about 30 minutes.It's hard to predict how it will sound on air. During the recording the noise of other audience members is relatively quiet in the mix, so as not to drown out the panellists. But when everything is mixed for broadcast, and the audience can be heard at normal volume, it's likely the presence of a crowd will make a significant difference.There's no doubt that the programme is better, funnier and livelier with a virtual audience. It's not perfect, and certainly not as good as the real thing. But until some kind of normality can resume, it works perfectly well for now. As Ince puts it: ""What a strange, beautiful thing it is. We're alone but we're together.""",2 June 2020,entertainment
"Coco, Marley and Me, and more movies to make you cry hard","If you often find yourself quietly (or loudly) sobbing at an emotional film, here's a warning - get an extra box of tissues before watching the films mentioned in this article.When US film critic Kevin Lee asked people to tell him ""the hardest you've ever cried in a movie/TV show"" on Twitter last week, he was unprepared for the onslaught that followed.""Within the first six hours, the responses were unlike anything I've ever received before,"" he says. ""It was a little bit scary to tell you the truth.""Film fans bombarded him with the titles that have left them in puddles of tears. He was even more surprised that some replies were accompanied by personal stories about why the films meant so much.""The responses were very sweet and each one was so different,"" he says.The BBC has analysed 35,000 replies. The top two tear-jerking films are not sweeping epics or heavyweight dramas - they are family favourites that tug hard at the heartstrings.Disney/Pixar's Oscar-winning 2017 animation Coco tops the mentions, thanks to its powerful story of a Mexican boy who crosses to the Land of the Dead and uncovers his family secrets while following his dream of becoming a musician.It is followed closely by 2008's Marley and Me, in which Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston's couple adopt an unruly Labrador, which accompanies them through their family life.Those two films were some way above anything else. This is not a scientific survey of course, but here are the top 10 films mentioned in replies to Kevin Lee's tweet.Lee, who writes for Film Inquiry and That Shelf, was not surprised to see Coco at the top of the list. ""I adored that film, and it just gets better and better with every viewing,"" he tells BBC News.""It takes familiar messages like 'pursue your dream' but adds extra layers, such as understanding your heritage, how that shapes you, how you help that culture evolve, and it honours those traditions while still being progressive and moving forward.""And the story is so emotional and the characters are so relatable - I think that is what got to many, many audiences.""Three animations, all Disney/Pixar creations, are in the top 10. Up is another cross-generational story, while Toy Story 3 has been described by Buzzfeed as ""probably one of the saddest movies of this generation"".Lee says he is a ""sucker"" for animated films because it's easier to be transported to, and immersed in, the worlds they create, he says.""Animation is so free to create their own premise, have that premise elevate the story they want to tell,"" he explains. ""Because of that it's so easy to disarm myself and let the story take me over.""Overall, two types of emotional storylines kept cropping up in fans' replies, he says.""One is crying over a character dying, either because they've grown so emotionally attached to that character and it's heartbreaking, or they'll share a personal story about how they lost someone close to them,"" he says.One user got in touch to tell him he was particularly moved by Coco because his own grandmother had recently died. (The grandmother in Coco is pivotal to that film's emotional punch.)""The other common trait I saw were films that were based on real history,"" Lee says. ""You had Schindler's List, Life Is Beautiful, Sophie's Choice, Saving Private Ryan, Grave of the Fireflies…""There are a lot of historical films that show the darkest chapters of human history [and] that really gets to people.""And when it comes to the darkest chapters of human history, that's when you see the worst of humanity but you also see the best of humanity, so it's both devastating but really moving as well. You're not quite sure if you're crying sad tears or happy tears.""Many of the films unsurprisingly involve (spoiler alert) death or departures in one form or another.The other top picks ranged from female-led 1980s dramas Terms of Endearment, Beaches and Steel Magnolias to 2019's Avengers: Endgame, which had its fair share of gut-wrenching moments between the superhero action.Lee believes his original tweet touched such a nerve partly because of the current coronavirus lockdown.""My only theory is I touched on the zeitgeist of how everyone's feeling at the moment,"" he reflects.""Everyone is way more isolated now, and there are a lot of folks out there who are alone in this lockdown. ""Perhaps this thread got a lot of people to want to just reach out and connect with others, and the current atmosphere has allowed people to open up with more personal stuff.""",2 June 2020,entertainment
How Europe's art world is welcoming back visitors,"Some of Europe's best known art museums are reopening after closing in March for the Covid-19 pandemic but it will be far from business as usual. For most of these museums and galleries, it will be a matter of limiting visitor numbers, intensifying cleaning procedures and insisting all tickets be bought online in advance.Normally at this time of year Amsterdam's huge and world-famous Rijksmuseum would have up to 12,000 visitors daily.From this week that number will be strictly limited to 2,000 a day. But after weeks of unwanted closure the museum's director Taco Dibbits is delighted to be reopening even on a limited scale.Several major public galleries around Europe have decided the arrival of June is the right time if not to fling open the doors at least to open them very carefully.Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum and the Rembrandt House also reopen this week. Dibbits says the decision to open Dutch museums is a matter of government policy. ""But I think we all felt this was the time to give the people of the Netherlands their museums back, which are so much loved. The Rijksmuseum is open with our normal hours although I think for now there will not be many tourists. ""Every case is different, not just in the Netherlands, and we all have to find our own way to provide a safe experience for visitors. I think almost all museums will insist visitors buy a ticket in advance and keep to the slot they are given online. ""But once you are in our museum you are able to roam free and we are deliberately keeping our visitors to about 20% of what they would normally be. You still have to keep 1.5 metres from other people but we wanted to make the experience of the museum as normal as possible."" Among other important venues reopening this week is the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Bilbao in northern Spain. It too has been shut since the middle of March. Initially it will only open from 2pm most days but it's coordinating with the city's Fine Arts Museum which will be open when the Guggenheim is closed. Its older but much smaller cousin, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice is also open again from this week. And in Rome one of Europe's great cultural glories is viewable by tourists once more - the Sistine Chapel, whose ceiling was painted by Michelangelo from 1508. For now visitors will need a face mask and will have their temperature taken when they enter the Vatican Museums. The Vatican authorities say there be will health workers on hand to help.One of Europe's most gorgeously located galleries of modern art is Denmark's Louisiana Museum on the coast an hour from Copenhagen, looking across the water to Sweden. It reopened on Friday.It benefits from an outside sculpture park, as well as the displays inside and was reopened last week by the Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. Like virtually all the museums which reopen this week it wants people to book ahead online. But Jan Hybertz Goricke of the museum says visitor numbers are generally about 2,500. ""So we will try to get people in even if they haven't pre-booked. I think all the museums which have reopened are going to find a way through the first weeks, trying to ensure visitors have an experience as good as possible.""The Louvre in Paris, possibly the world's most famous art museum, remains closed but it's scheduled to open on 6 July. The Louvre Lens, in eastern France, starts to reopen from this week.All these changes are provisional: if Covid-19 starts to peak again it's possible some or all of these re-openings could be reversed. And in many places it will remain hard or impossible to visit these museums without pre-booking for months to come.But this week art galleries and museums in certain European countries have something to celebrate at last.",2 June 2020,entertainment

""I'm good at dying.""Filming on the sixth series of Line of Duty was suspended in March due to the spread of the coronavirus.The only non-scripted nominee on this year's shortlist comes from ITV2's Love Island, which was rocked earlier this year by the suicide of presenter Caroline Flack.The nominated moment comes from the episode shown last July in which contestant Michael Griffiths chose to ""recouple"" with Joanna Chimonides and leave Amber Gill single.Beauty therapist Amber had the last laugh though, eventually being crowned winner of the series alongside Irish rugby player Greg O'Shea.Details on how to vote for the Virgin Media Must-See Moment award can be found here.",3 June 2020,entertainment
