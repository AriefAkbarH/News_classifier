Christo: Bulgarian-born artist who famously wrapped landmarks dies at 84,"Bulgarian-born artist Christo, best known for wrapping buildings and famous landmarks in fabric or plastic, has died at his home in New York, aged 84. He passed away of natural causes on Sunday, according to a statement posted on the artist's official Facebook page.Christo, who always worked with his wife Jeanne-Claude, famously covered the Reichstag in Berlin and the Pont-Neuf in Paris with reams of cloth. His artworks ""brought people together"" around the world, the statement says.""Christo lived his life to the fullest, not only dreaming up what seemed impossible, but realising it,"" it reads, adding that the couple's art ""lives on in our hearts and memories"". A 2016 installation entitled The Floating Piers consisted of 100,000 sq m of bright yellow fabric floating on polyethylene cubes on Lake Iseo, in Sulzano, Italy. Shakespeare told us 'all the world's a stage', Christo showed us all the world's an art gallery. The Bulgarian-born artist wasn't interested in the sterile white walls of the modern museum where objects exist apart from everyday life. He wanted to turn everyday life into art, to make people look again and think again about their surroundings. He did this by way of intervention - either by wrapping a building such as the Reichstag in Berlin in blue material, or a section of the Australian coastline in one million square feet of fabric - in both cases turning cold, hard structures into sensuous, fragile sculptures. He worked in collaboration with his wife Jeanne-Claude, whom he met in Paris in 1958. They made their first major outdoor work three years later in Germany, covering oil barrels stacked in Cologne harbour with material. Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 leaving Christo to continue alone, which he did, with a plan to wrap the L'Arc de Triomphe in Paris next year - a project that will probably still be realised. In 2018, a Christo artwork - his first major outdoor piece to appear in the UK - was unveiled at the Serpentine in London's Hyde Park. The London Mastaba was a colourful sculpture in the shape of a trapezoid and made from more than 7,500 200-litre barrels stacked together, displayed on a floating platform. Born Christo Vladimirov Javacheff in Gabrovo, Bulgaria, in 1935, he spent time in Austria and Switzerland before moving to France, where he met Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon in Paris. Along with transforming large-scale landmarks, the couple also created monumental environmental works of art together in natural settings, before Jeanne-Claude's death in 2009, aged 74. An unfinished project in Paris entitled L'Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped is planned to be completed and exhibited in September 2021, in accordance with Christo's wishes. ""We borrow space and create gentle disturbances for a few days,"" Christo once said. Sunday's statement concludes: ""In a 1958 letter Christo wrote, 'Beauty, science and art will always triumph'. We hold those words closely today.""",1 June 2020,entertainment
The Machine Stops: Will Gompertz reviews EM Forster's work ★★★★★,"My wife was listening to a radio programme the other day and heard a man talking about artificial intelligence. He mentioned a science fiction novella by EM Forster called The Machine Stops, published in 1909. He said it was remarkably prescient. The missus hadn't heard of it, and nor had I. Frankly, we didn't have Forster down as a sci-fi guy, more Merchant Ivory films starring Helena Bonham Carter and elegant Edwardian dresses. We ordered a copy (you can read it for free online).   OMG! as Forster would not have said. The Machine Stops is not simply prescient; it is a jaw-droppingly, gob-smackingly, breath-takingly accurate literary description of lockdown life in 2020. If it had been written today it would be excellent, that it was written over a century ago is astonishing. The short story is set in what must have seemed a futuristic world to Forster but won't to you. People live alone in identikit homes (globalisation) where they choose to isolate (his word), send messages by pneumatic post (a proto email or WhatsApp), and chat online via a video interface uncannily similar to Zoom or Skype. ""The clumsy system of public gatherings had long since been abandoned"", along with touching strangers (""the custom had become obsolete""), now considered verboten in this new civilisation in which humans live in underground cells with an Alexa-like computer catering to their every whim. If it already sounds spookily close for comfort, you won't be reassured to know that members of this detached society know thousands of people via machine-controlled social networks that encourage users to receive and impart second-hand ideas. ""In certain directions human intercourse had advanced enormously"" writes the visionary author drily, before adding later:""But humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and complacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to mean progress of the machine.""It's not lost on me that you are reading this on the internet on a man-made device over which we just about still believe we have mastery. Not for long according to Forster's story, nor, I suspect, some of the boffins behind AI today. We are in Frankenstein's monster territory, another literary warning we probably shouldn't ignore. Forster has no similar scary physical manifestation of science going wrong in The Machine Stops (the title says it all), but that brings it even closer to home. The tale's two protagonists, Vashti and her son Kuno, are normal people, just like you or me. She lives in the southern hemisphere, he lives in the north. Kuno wants his mother to visit. She isn't keen. ""But I can see you!"" she exclaimed. ""What more do you want?""""I want to see you not through the Machine,"" said Kuno. ""I want to speak to you not through the wearisome Machine.""""Oh, hush!"" said his mother, vaguely shocked. ""You mustn't say anything against the Machine.""She prefers social distancing and giving her online lecture on Music During the Australian Period to an unseen armchair audience who lap-up abstract historical information that has absolutely no relevance to their actual subterranean lives beyond being an illusory distraction from their hollowed-out existence (not dissimilar to lectures under lockdown, maybe). I won't say any more about what happens - it is a very short story that can be read in under an hour - other than to mention it is basically a machine-age take on Plato's The Allegory of the Cave. The Machine (or internet for us) is the airless, sunless, solitary cave in which we exist, the information it imparts the shadows on the wall.EM Forster published the story between A Room with a View (1908) and Howard's End (1910), two novels in which he explores similar philosophical themes around inner and outer worlds, truth and pretence. The Machine Stops first appeared in the Oxford and Cambridge Review in the same year as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published his furious Futurist Manifesto in Le Figaro newspaper. The Italian poet was arguing for the very opposite to Forster's prophetic parable.Marinetti embraced the machine, arguing that a speeding car was far more beautiful than an ancient Greek sculpture. The past was a dead weight that needed destroying to make way for the future.He would have liked Vashti, who, when travelling by airship to see Kuno, pulled down her blind over Greece because that was no place to find ideas - an ironic joke by Forster given the idea for his story came from Plato's Athens.  That's about it for jokes in a novella where there really is no such thing as community, or direct experience, and it is impossible to get away from the constant hum of the machine without asking the Central Committee for an Egression-permit to go outside. At which point you strap on a respirator and take your chances in the real world. As the man on the radio said, it's prescient. And very, very good.

Along with transforming large-scale landmarks, the couple also created monumental environmental works of art together in natural settings, before Jeanne-Claude's death in 2009, aged 74. An unfinished project in Paris entitled L'Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped is planned to be completed and exhibited in September 2021, in accordance with Christo's wishes. ""We borrow space and create gentle disturbances for a few days,"" Christo once said. Sunday's statement concludes: ""In a 1958 letter Christo wrote, 'Beauty, science and art will always triumph'. We hold those words closely today.""",1 June 2020,entertainment
The Machine Stops: Will Gompertz reviews EM Forster's work ★★★★★,"My wife was listening to a radio programme the other day and heard a man talking about artificial intelligence. He mentioned a science fiction novella by EM Forster called The Machine Stops, published in 1909. He said it was remarkably prescient. The missus hadn't heard of it, and nor had I. Frankly, we didn't have Forster down as a sci-fi guy, more Merchant Ivory films starring Helena Bonham Carter and elegant Edwardian dresses. We ordered a copy (you can read it for free online).   OMG! as Forster would not have said. The Machine Stops is not simply prescient; it is a jaw-droppingly, gob-smackingly, breath-takingly accurate literary description of lockdown life in 2020. If it had been written today it would be excellent, that it was written over a century ago is astonishing. The short story is set in what must have seemed a futuristic world to Forster but won't to you. People live alone in identikit homes (globalisation) where they choose to isolate (his word), send messages by pneumatic post (a proto email or WhatsApp), and chat online via a video interface uncannily similar to Zoom or Skype. ""The clumsy system of public gatherings had long since been abandoned"", along with touching strangers (""the custom had become obsolete""), now considered verboten in this new civilisation in which humans live in underground cells with an Alexa-like computer catering to their every whim. If it already sounds spookily close for comfort, you won't be reassured to know that members of this detached society know thousands of people via machine-controlled social networks that encourage users to receive and impart second-hand ideas. ""In certain directions human intercourse had advanced enormously"" writes the visionary author drily, before adding later:""But humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and complacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to mean progress of the machine.""It's not lost on me that you are reading this on the internet on a man-made device over which we just about still believe we have mastery. Not for long according to Forster's story, nor, I suspect, some of the boffins behind AI today. We are in Frankenstein's monster territory, another literary warning we probably shouldn't ignore. Forster has no similar scary physical manifestation of science going wrong in The Machine Stops (the title says it all), but that brings it even closer to home. The tale's two protagonists, Vashti and her son Kuno, are normal people, just like you or me. She lives in the southern hemisphere, he lives in the north. Kuno wants his mother to visit. She isn't keen. ""But I can see you!"" she exclaimed. ""What more do you want?""""I want to see you not through the Machine,"" said Kuno. ""I want to speak to you not through the wearisome Machine.""""Oh, hush!"" said his mother, vaguely shocked. ""You mustn't say anything against the Machine.""She prefers social distancing and giving her online lecture on Music During the Australian Period to an unseen armchair audience who lap-up abstract historical information that has absolutely no relevance to their actual subterranean lives beyond being an illusory distraction from their hollowed-out existence (not dissimilar to lectures under lockdown, maybe). I won't say any more about what happens - it is a very short story that can be read in under an hour - other than to mention it is basically a machine-age take on Plato's The Allegory of the Cave. The Machine (or internet for us) is the airless, sunless, solitary cave in which we exist, the information it imparts the shadows on the wall.EM Forster published the story between A Room with a View (1908) and Howard's End (1910), two novels in which he explores similar philosophical themes around inner and outer worlds, truth and pretence. The Machine Stops first appeared in the Oxford and Cambridge Review in the same year as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published his furious Futurist Manifesto in Le Figaro newspaper. The Italian poet was arguing for the very opposite to Forster's prophetic parable.Marinetti embraced the machine, arguing that a speeding car was far more beautiful than an ancient Greek sculpture. The past was a dead weight that needed destroying to make way for the future.He would have liked Vashti, who, when travelling by airship to see Kuno, pulled down her blind over Greece because that was no place to find ideas - an ironic joke by Forster given the idea for his story came from Plato's Athens.  That's about it for jokes in a novella where there really is no such thing as community, or direct experience, and it is impossible to get away from the constant hum of the machine without asking the Central Committee for an Egression-permit to go outside. At which point you strap on a respirator and take your chances in the real world. As the man on the radio said, it's prescient. And very, very good.

"Obituary: Christo Javacheff, the artist who wrapped the world","Once a penniless painter on the boulevards of Paris, nobody did art like Christo.The charismatic Eastern European refugee became world famous for monumental installations, covering huge objects in miles of fabric and rope. Every project was preposterous in concept, taking decades to design, finance and deliver.       He wrapped enormous buildings, avenues of trees, entire coastlines and island chains. Each one cost millions with official permission almost impossible to get. Yet, when finally completed, they were gone again in a matter of weeks.It was a life of herculean tasks. His determination to see them through never dimmed.Even in his eighties, he was working on a scheme to rival the pharaohs. A vast stairway to heaven in the deserts of Abu Dhabi, made from 410,000 brightly coloured oil barrels. A final, grand statement larger than the Great Pyramid itself. Christo Vladimirov Javacheff was born on 13 June 1935 in Gabrovo, a small town in the Bulgarian mountains.His father Ivan was a chemist who ran a factory making fabrics. His mother, Tzeta Dimitrova, a political activist. Their social circle was one of artists and intellectuals, the household a swirl of radical ideas questioning the boundaries of contemporary culture.A bohemian childhood, where artistic creativity was encouraged from the start, was constantly disrupted by war. As a boy, Christo saw his country first brutally uprooted; first by the Nazis and then the Russians. Politics, as well as art, shaped his early years.In 1952, he attended the Art Academy in Sofia. There he was expected to join the Communist Youth and produce realistic, anti-capitalist work glorifying the values of socialism. He turned out the kind of populist propaganda pieces the system demanded. But he found it suffocating. ""The work of art,"" he would say, ""is a scream of freedom.""He moved to Prague, got into theatre design and immersed himself in the works of great artists; Miro, Matisse, Kandinsky. When the Hungarian revolution broke out, he saw students and intellectuals like himself dealt with ruthlessly. So he fled.  Bribing a railway worker, he hid on a train taking medicine to Austria. He made it to Vienna but found himself officially stateless - dirt poor and unable to speak the language in a Europe awash with refugees.A few years later, he washed up in Paris. He scraped a living painting portraits on the street, something he likened to prostitution. A woman saw an example at the hairdressers and liked it, inviting the struggling artist to her chateaux to paint a picture of her.The woman's daughter was flame-haired Jeanne-Claude. She would become Christo's wife, his muse, his voice and life-long business partner and creative soul mate.  ""Mother's brought home another stray,"" she thought at the time. Fortunately, that first impression didn't last. He showed her his 'real work'. In 1920, Man Ray had wrapped a sewing machine with a blanket, appropriating an everyday object and making it art. Profoundly influenced, Christo's garret was stuffed floor-to-ceiling with similar pieces. ""My God"", she recalled thinking. ""This guy is crazy!""She got pregnant and married a more suitable man but walked out after three weeks. She and Christo were never apart again. Jeanne-Claude's father, a four-star general in the French army, didn't speak to her for years.What followed was an extraordinary artistic collaboration lasting more than 50 years. At first, their work was credited to Christo alone, feeling that it was easier for one person's name to become established. Only latterly did Jeanne-Claude's contribution get the equal billing it deserved.She encouraged him away from small objects in favour of the monumental.  In 1962, reacting to the building of the Berlin Wall, they blocked off the Rue Visconti in Paris with a pile of oil drums some 4m high.  They begged the police to let it stand for a while but within hours it had gone. They moved to New York, living in an illegal squat as undocumented migrants.  He began producing the sketches and project plans they sold to finance their creations.  She took on the logistics and gathered the necessary permissions.In 1969, they wrapped more than 2km of coastline in Little Bay, Australia.  In places, the cliffs soared to more than 26m high.  It took an hour to walk from one end of the installation to the other.Next, they created a fabric fence in California - nearly 40km long and 6m high.  Nine lawyers were hired to persuade dozens of local farmers to give their blessing.In 1983, the couple surrounded 11 islands in Miami's Biscayne Bay with more than 600,000 square metres of bright pink polypropylene.  The material was individually cut to fit each shoreline.  Four hundred people were needed to put everything into place. Walkways were sewn into the fabric for the public.  The 'exhibit' was up for just two weeks, then all 11km of it was taken down.  Christo and Jeanne-Claude wanted their works to be joyful and beautiful, encouraging the observer to see the familiar anew.  But they refused to give these vast creations any 'meaning' past an immediate aesthetic impact.The direct impact on the environment was controversial.  The couple were careful to recycle everything they used.  And none of it was built to last.  Its temporary nature was a key part of the concept. Like the rainbow, its momentary existence was what made it all so wonderful. ""They all go away when they're finished,"" Christo once said of his creations. ""Only the preparatory drawings and collages are left, giving my works an almost legendary character.  I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create things that will remain.""Up to a point, perhaps. The site-specific creations might have been designed with a fleeting wow factor in mind, but as a body of work they spoke to important themes - impact on the environment, 20th Century human conflict, and the need for perseverance in defence of freedom of expression.In 1984, they wrapped the Pont Neuf in Paris. It took them nine years to persuade the mayor, Jacques Chirac, to let them do it.  Forty thousand metres of golden sandstone fabric was used, chosen to imitate colour of the pavements at sunset.Next was a $26m project to erect thousands of huge umbrellas - blue ones in Japan, yellow ones in southern California.  They were paid for, as always, by the sale of Christo's drawings.  They never accepted sponsorship, which would have imposed unacceptable limitations on their art.  Three million came to look and picnic in the shade.  Years of lobbying came to fruition in 1995, when the German parliament allowed them to spread 100,000m of fireproof material around the Reichstag.  All tied down with 15km of rope.The most difficult was the one closest to home.  Its title, The Gates, Central Park, New York 1979-2005, referred to the years it had taken them to persuade the city to let them do it. In February 2005, more than 7,000 gates made from saffron coloured fabric were finally placed along the paths that wind through the Big Apple's green lung.  Together, they formed a fluttering trail 37km long.  Five million came to be amazed.  A week later, everything was packed away.Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 after complications following a brain aneurysm. For years she had been seen as little more than Christo's business partner and PR manager.  In reality, they were two sides of the same creative coin, travelling in different planes so that, if one died, their artistic vision would survive.Without her, Christo pushed on with their unfinished projects.  In 2016, he installed a series of walkways on Lake Iseo near Brescia, Italy. Visitors could walk for more than 3km, just above the calm surface of the waters, from the mainland to the islands of Monte Isola and San Pedro.""The most beautiful part,"" he said, ""is about the people walking nowhere.  It's not like going to the shop, not going to see your friends.  It's really going nowhere.""Despite his claim his work was nothing more than the impact of the aesthetic on the human senses, Christo will be remembered for a body of work that pushed artistic boundaries.  He challenged the idea that sculpture has be something fixed and permanent.  He deliberately blurred the line between art and its natural environment.  And he did it on a truly epic scale.His death means we will never see all his visions come to reality.  There were plenty that never made it past the drawing board.  Even decades of lobbying never let him wrap some of the skyscrapers in New York.  He cancelled a plan to cover the Colorado River, despite spending $14m getting permission, in protest at the election of Donald Trump.  A plan to wrap the Arc de Triomphe in Paris is still set to go ahead next year, but who knows if his scheme in the desert will ever make it from design stage to reality in his absence? It is intended to be 500ft high, with a base the size of the piazza at St Peter's in Rome.And this one, the only one of all his projects, was designed to be permanent.  A lasting tribute to an extraordinary creative partnership whose every scheme was more innovative, ambitious and dauntingly complicated than the last.",1 June 2020,entertainment
Coronation Street sets date to resume filming,"Coronation Street cameras will start rolling again next week, meaning the ITV soap will not fall off air, despite an 11-week interruption to filming.Bosses have said filming will resume on 9 June, and crew have already returned to the Manchester set to prepare.Social distancing and other safety measures will be in place.But no actors with underlying health conditions or aged over 70 will be allowed back yet - ruling out the likes of William Roache and Maureen Lipman.After filming was halted in March, ITV went down to airing three episodes per week. The new filming pattern will allow the same broadcast schedule to continue, ITV said.Cast and crew will have their temperatures checked on a daily basis, and actors will put on their own make-up and costumes.Actors over 70 or those with underlying conditions ""won't be on set in the initial period of filming"", a statement said.Other measures will include crew members being assigned only to certain parts of the set and having designated equipment.Actor Andrew Whyment, who plays Kirk Sutherland, told ITV's Good Morning Britain With Lorraine Kelly: ""I think everybody is ready to get back to work now. It's going to be different, but I think we're all ready to get back now, get back to shooting the show again.""John Whiston, ITV managing director of continuing drama, said: ""With the peak past, all indications are that the time is right for a return to filming. And with the extensive protocols we have put in place, we have made our workplace as safe as possible.""I'm sure our audience will appreciate having the show they love continue on air. For many who have written in it is a vital escape from all the fears and stresses this virus brings in its wake.""In remarks reported by Broadcast magazine last week, Whiston said there were some challenges to making life on the cobbles look like it is picking up from where it left off.""For some reason during lockdown, all the men have shaved their heads, while the women have dyed their hair,"" he said. ""That is proving quite a headache - particularly as we can't go near them to do anything with it.""Emmerdale has already returned to filming, by recording new episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown. EastEnders is also expected to resume this month.It follows the publication in May of guidelines for the TV industry to get back to work.Meanwhile on Monday, further safety guidelines were published for the return of film and ""high-end"", bigger-budget TV drama.They include measures such as social distancing, and they also say:",1 June 2020,entertainment
Christo: Bulgarian-born artist who famously wrapped landmarks dies at 84,"Bulgarian-born artist Christo, best known for wrapping buildings and famous landmarks in fabric or plastic, has died at his home in New York, aged 84. He passed away of natural causes on Sunday, according to a statement posted on the artist's official Facebook page.Christo, who always worked with his wife Jeanne-Claude, famously covered the Reichstag in Berlin and the Pont-Neuf in Paris with reams of cloth. His artworks ""brought people together"" around the world, the statement says.""Christo lived his life to the fullest, not only dreaming up what seemed impossible, but realising it,"" it reads, adding that the couple's art ""lives on in our hearts and memories"". A 2016 installation entitled The Floating Piers consisted of 100,000 sq m of bright yellow fabric floating on polyethylene cubes on Lake Iseo, in Sulzano, Italy. Shakespeare told us 'all the world's a stage', Christo showed us all the world's an art gallery. The Bulgarian-born artist wasn't interested in the sterile white walls of the modern museum where objects exist apart from everyday life. He wanted to turn everyday life into art, to make people look again and think again about their surroundings. He did this by way of intervention - either by wrapping a building such as the Reichstag in Berlin in blue material, or a section of the Australian coastline in one million square feet of fabric - in both cases turning cold, hard structures into sensuous, fragile sculptures. He worked in collaboration with his wife Jeanne-Claude, whom he met in Paris in 1958. They made their first major outdoor work three years later in Germany, covering oil barrels stacked in Cologne harbour with material. Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 leaving Christo to continue alone, which he did, with a plan to wrap the L'Arc de Triomphe in Paris next year - a project that will probably still be realised. In 2018, a Christo artwork - his first major outdoor piece to appear in the UK - was unveiled at the Serpentine in London's Hyde Park. The London Mastaba was a colourful sculpture in the shape of a trapezoid and made from more than 7,500 200-litre barrels stacked together, displayed on a floating platform. Born Christo Vladimirov Javacheff in Gabrovo, Bulgaria, in 1935, he spent time in Austria and Switzerland before moving to France, where he met Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon in Paris. Along with transforming large-scale landmarks, the couple also created monumental environmental works of art together in natural settings, before Jeanne-Claude's death in 2009, aged 74. An unfinished project in Paris entitled L'Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped is planned to be completed and exhibited in September 2021, in accordance with Christo's wishes.
