Feud erupts over Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's US chart position,"Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber have defended themselves after rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine accused them of buying the number one spot on the US chart.The rapper claimed the pop stars had bought tens of thousands of copies of their charity duet Stuck With U to boost its position.He also said some streams of his song Gooba were improperly discounted, leaving it in third place on the chart.Grande, Bieber and chart compilers Billboard have all denied the claims.Bieber called the rapper's accusations ""a lie"", while Grande advised him to ""take a moment to humble yourself"".Billboard, which publishes the US charts, posted a lengthy article refuting each of his points while explaining how positions were calculated.""Overall, Stuck With U drew 28.1 million US streams, 26.3 million in radio airplay audience and 108,000 sold in the tracking week,"" it explained. ""Gooba had 55.3 million US streams, 172,000 in radio airplay audience and 24,000 sold.""Those sums resulted in the songs' respective rankings on this week's Hot 100.""End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevoGooba is Tekashi 6ix9ine's first single since he was released from prison into house arrest last month.He was serving time after pleading guilty to multiple counts of racketeering, firearms offences and drug trafficking, and was freed over fears that his chronic asthma would make him vulnerable to the coronavirus.The 23-year-old first expressed his dissatisfaction on Friday in an Instagram video where he claimed the charts were being rigged.He presented forecasts that were purportedly sent to major record labels on Thursday, which showed Grande and Bieber's duet charting at number five.6ix9ine then showed a second email, which he claimed was sent at ""the last second"" on Thursday night (the cut-off point for sales to be included in the chart). It showed that Stuck With U had sold an additional 60,000 copies, boosting it to number one.""Literally, you're manipulating the charts now,"" he said. ""So, Billboard, the world is watching.""When the charts were announced on Monday, the rapper intensified his criticism, claiming the pop stars had bought tens of thousands of copies of their own single.""Understand this, they bought 30,000 or so units on six credit cards,"" he said. ""It's all manipulated, it's all fabricated,"" he added, before accusing Billboard of ""disqualifying"" 20 million or so of Gooba's streams.""I want the world to know that Billboard is a lie. You can buy number ones.""Bieber rejected several of the rapper's arguments. ""He says his streams don't count,"" he wrote. ""Yes they do, but he is counting his global streams and this is a domestic chart, so only domestic streams count.""He added that the additional 60,000 sales of Stuck With U were not reported until Thursday as a tactic to beat the competition. ""That's called strategy,"" said the singer.And he said it was impossible to buy 30,000 copies of a single on six credit cards because bulk purchases were against chart rules.Grande responded with her own statement on Instagram. Although she didn't mention 6ix9ine by name, she made her feelings clear.After thanking fans for their support, the singer said: ""You cannot discredit this as hard as you try.""She added: ""To anybody that is displeased with their placement on the chart this week... I ask you to take a moment to humble yourself. Be grateful you're even here.""Billboard's column went into forensic detail on how the charts were compiled.Grande and Bieber's tally was boosted by the availability of a physical/digital bundle - meaning fans could buy an autographed copy of the single, to be posted at a later date, along with a download that was available immediately. Both counted as an separate sale.Setting the feud aside, Grande and Bieber's manager Scooter Braun emphasised that proceeds from their single were going to the First Responders Children's Fund.""Thank you to all the first responders and their families,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""Let's keep raising money for them as they sacrifice for us. Nuff said.""",19 May 2020,entertainment

Coronavirus: Travis McCready plays America's first gig in months,"Country musician Travis McCready played to an audience wearing face masks in what's been described as the first US concert since the Covid-19 lockdown.The gig, in Arkansas, offered a glimpse of how live music could resume in the UK, with compulsory temperature tests and social distancing for all present.Concert-goers were required to buy seats in clusters, branded ""fan pods"", and large areas were roped off.""It's just nice to be doing something that's normal,"" said one attendee.A snapshot of the socially distanced Travis McCready show tonight: pic.twitter.com/OlHJbDzT9KEnd of Twitter post  by @TimesRecordMcCready's concert was originally scheduled for Friday, 15 May, in Fort Smith, Arkansas, but Governor Asa Hutchinson said it failed to meet the state's public health standards.The venue - a former Masonic temple called TempleLive - was threatened with a cease-and-desist order and had its alcohol licence revoked.But after making adjustments to their concert plan, the venue received permission to stage the concert on Monday night.Under the state-approved plan, all employees and audience members over the age of 10 were required to wear face coverings, and performers were instructed to maintain a minimum distance of 12 feet from the audience.The state also allowed TempleLive to have 239 people seated in the 1,100-seat venue.After receiving the go-ahead, representatives from the venue maintained they had delayed the concert against their will.""This is about rock and roll, and having a good time, and live music, and being out with your peers, and doing what you do as an American: You get out, you do things,"" Mike Brown told reporters at Arkansas TV station KFSM-TV.Speaking to the New York Times, Mr Brown also argued that concert venues were being held to stricter standards than other public gatherings.""If you can go to a church and it's a public assembly, there is no difference,"" said Mike Brown, a representative for Temple Live. ""How is it OK for one group to have a public meeting, and it's not OK for a music venue to have the same opportunity?""State officials argued that a concert was more dangerous than a religious gathering because it was more likely to attract visitors from out-of-town.This will give you an idea of the socially distanced seating at the @templelivefsm show tonight. pic.twitter.com/1JR8F2AUtNEnd of Twitter post  by @MBryanTimesRecWhen the show finally went ahead on Monday night, Mr Brown greeted the audience by playing the Beastie Boys' Fight For Your Right (To Party) before introducing support act Lauren Brown.McCready took to the stage later, without referencing the strange circumstances. Nonetheless, fans seemed to appreciate the show.""We're happy to be here,"" said LaLisa Smiddy, who drove four hours to attend the concert. ""I'm one of the more paranoid ones out there, and when I saw everything this venue has done, I was ready to come,"" she told the New York Times. ""I think they've done an outstanding job.""However, McCready's show is unlikely to kickstart a return to live music just yet, with most experts predicting that large-scale shows will not resume before the end of 2020.In the UK, many small venues are at risk of closure due to the sudden lack of income, prompting the Music Venue Trust to launch a ""Save Our Venues"" fundraising campaign last month.The initiative has raised £1.5m so far, meaning 140 venues have been temporarily saved from the threat of imminent closure.""This is a good start,"" said CEO Mark Davyd, ""but we cannot relax as we still have a mountain to climb to secure the long-term future of this sector. ""We still desperately need more music industry companies to step up and help with donations alongside real action from government specifically around rent relief, more financial help and clearer guidance.""",19 May 2020,entertainment

The world lost an awesome person.""His mother Lisa Wayne wrote: ""I'm sick without you. I'm torn, I'm lost.

Why did you leave me?""She added: ""Never another hug, kiss or to hear those words, I love you again. I'm broken. I love you Greggy, my Hunny.""She said Boyce and Adepoju were in the process of starting a chicken wings business with flavours named after west coast rappers.Boyce leaves behind a 10-year-old daughter, while Adepoju had a young son.A GoFundMe page for Adepoju's funeral said: ""Natalie had so much life to live we are saddened that her life was cut short.""The Clark County Coroner's Office, which covers Las Vegas, confirmed the news to various US media outlets, telling USA Today the causes of death were pending toxicology results.Police spokesman Larry Hadfield told the Las Vegas Review-Journal: ""The incident was not criminal.""",19 May 2020,entertainment

BBC Three moves online after final night as TV channel,"BBC Three has broadcast its final night as a television channel as the youth strand goes online only.Programmes and other content such as animations and short films will now be available via the channel's website and the BBC iPlayer.The network has already posted a video from its YouTube account welcoming viewers to the new platforms.The move to online was first proposed in 2014 and was approved by the BBC Trust in November.The Trust said there was ""clear public value in moving BBC Three online, as independent evidence shows younger audiences are watching more online and watching less linear TV"".BBC Director General Tony Hall has said the move will save the corporation £30m.But the plans caused controversy, prompting the Save BBC Three campaign which saw more than 300,000 people sign a petition to keep the channel broadcasting on television.Monday evening was its last night as a linear TV channel, and saw BBC Three broadcasting episodes of some of its most popular programmes, including The Mighty Boosh, Family Guy, American Dad and Bad Education.The final programme broadcast on the television channel last night was a repeat of the first ever episode of Gavin And Stacey, the sitcom created and written by Ruth Jones and James Corden - who has since found international success as a talk show host in the US.The target audience of the strand will remain 16-24 year-olds as it goes online.The move means that entire series of original programmes previously broadcast on the network including Little Britain and Him & Her will be available to watch on demand.It aligns the service more closely with services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime - where whole ""box sets"" of programmes are available to watch.However, unlike those services, the new programmes that have so far been announced for the new BBC Three will be made available one episode at a time.Among the new content going live on Tuesday is the first episode of the new series of the sitcom Cuckoo and the stand-up comedy programme Live From The BBC.In addition to full-length programmes, the network will offer a daily stream of content including short films, blogs and news and sport updates - delivered through a new online platform called the Daily Drop, combining original content with material produced by other BBC services including Trending and Radio 1's Newsbeat. Content will also be delivered via BBC Three's YouTube channel and social media accounts including Snapchat and Facebook.The BBC confirmed in a statement that all original programmes being broadcast on the new online channel will be repeated at a later date on BBC One or BBC Two.Last month, the network revealed its new logo, prompting ridicule on social media because of its apparent resemblance to a logo unveiled in the satirical sitcom W1A. By David Sillito, BBC Media and Arts CorrespondentThis is quite clearly an experiment. Most people still largely watch traditional TV programmes on traditional TV channels.   The new BBC Three will offer up new programmes (around four hours a week of new content) on a website, the iPlayer and YouTube and then hope the audience will discover it amongst the deluge of video material that appears every day across the internet.   Up to this point, online video has been a side dish to the main channels - a chance to catch up or see something extra. Removing the promotional impact of a linear channel risks turning BBC Three into just another website.  However, it does release part of the BBC from the strait jacket of the traditional forms. Programmes can be whatever length the producers want. Programmes can be turned around much more quickly. Programmes don't have to look or feel like programmes at all. Also, all the traditional programmes made by BBC Three will end up at some point on BBC One or BBC Two.          ",16 February 2016,entertainment
Feud erupts over Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's US chart position,"Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber have defended themselves after rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine accused them of buying the number one spot on the US chart.The rapper claimed the pop stars had bought tens of thousands of copies of their charity duet Stuck With U to boost its position.He also said some streams of his song Gooba were improperly discounted, leaving it in third place on the chart.Grande, Bieber and chart compilers Billboard have all denied the claims.Bieber called the rapper's accusations ""a lie"", while Grande advised him to ""take a moment to humble yourself"".Billboard, which publishes the US charts, posted a lengthy article refuting each of his points while explaining how positions were calculated.""Overall, Stuck With U drew 28.1 million US streams, 26.3 million in radio airplay audience and 108,000 sold in the tracking week,"" it explained.

Coronavirus: Travis McCready plays America's first gig in months,"Country musician Travis McCready played to an audience wearing face masks in what's been described as the first US concert since the Covid-19 lockdown.The gig, in Arkansas, offered a glimpse of how live music could resume in the UK, with compulsory temperature tests and social distancing for all present.Concert-goers were required to buy seats in clusters, branded ""fan pods"", and large areas were roped off.""It's just nice to be doing something that's normal,"" said one attendee.McCready's concert was originally scheduled for Friday, 15 May, in Fort Smith, Arkansas, but Governor Asa Hutchinson said it failed to meet the state's public health standards.The venue - a former Masonic temple called TempleLive - was threatened with a cease-and-desist order and had its alcohol licence revoked.But after making adjustments to their concert plan, the venue received permission to stage the concert on Monday night.Under the state-approved plan, all employees and audience members over the age of 10 were required to wear face coverings, and performers were instructed to maintain a minimum distance of 12 feet from the audience.The state also allowed TempleLive to have 239 people seated in the 1,100-seat venue.After receiving the go-ahead, representatives from the venue maintained they had delayed the concert against their will.""This is about rock and roll, and having a good time, and live music, and being out with your peers, and doing what you do as an American: You get out, you do things,"" Mike Brown told reporters at Arkansas TV station KFSM-TV.Speaking to the New York Times, Mr Brown also argued that concert venues were being held to stricter standards than other public gatherings.""If you can go to a church and it's a public assembly, there is no difference,"" said Mike Brown, a representative for Temple Live. ""How is it OK for one group to have a public meeting, and it's not OK for a music venue to have the same opportunity?""State officials argued that a concert was more dangerous than a religious gathering because it was more likely to attract visitors from out-of-town.When the show finally went ahead on Monday night, Mr Brown greeted the audience by playing the Beastie Boys' Fight For Your Right (To Party) before introducing support act Lauren Brown.McCready took to the stage later, without referencing the strange circumstances. Nonetheless, fans seemed to appreciate the show.""We're happy to be here,"" said LaLisa Smiddy, who drove four hours to attend the concert. ""I'm one of the more paranoid ones out there, and when I saw everything this venue has done, I was ready to come,"" she told the New York Times. ""I think they've done an outstanding job.""However, McCready's show is unlikely to kickstart a return to live music just yet, with most experts predicting that large-scale shows will not resume before the end of 2020.In the UK, many small venues are at risk of closure due to the sudden lack of income, prompting the Music Venue Trust to launch a ""Save Our Venues"" fundraising campaign last month.The initiative has raised £1.5m so far, meaning 140 venues have been temporarily saved from the threat of imminent closure.""This is a good start,"" said CEO Mark Davyd, ""but we cannot relax as we still have a mountain to climb to secure the long-term future of this sector. ""We still desperately need more music industry companies to step up and help with donations alongside real action from government specifically around rent relief, more financial help and clearer guidance.""",19 May 2020,entertainment

How live entertainment is evolving online to be a lifeline in lockdown,"From gigs to plays and quizzes, live entertainment has moved online during coronavirus lockdown - and creative minds are coming up with new ideas to give us back some of the human connection we've lost.Every Saturday for the past two months, Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has sat down and written a song.Well, he has co-written a song - with 5,000 fans on Instagram.He asks them for chords, comes up with melodies, and puts them to a vote. He then asks for ideas for lyrics before coming back an hour later with a finished track. ""Some are really good,"" he says. End of Youtube post  by Snow PatrolLightbody also performs solo online gigs from home, but wanted to do something more collaborative too.""You can say absolutely anything in this. It's therapeutic and cathartic for me,"" he explains.""In a 'gig', I chat a little bit, but you can't really read the comments because you're playing songs. But with this, it feels like you're engaging with everybody.""The fans also vote for the set lists in his regular online concerts. ""I could just choose a bunch of songs that I want to play, which I did do one week and it just didn't really work,"" Lightbody says. ""It just felt a little disconnected.""I miss playing live, I do. But it's going to be a long time, so this is what we've got.""With the communal thrill of congregating in the same room currently out of the question, Lightbody is among the artists to have come up with interesting ways to bring people together.When his Saturday Songwrite sessions have generated 10 or 12 decent tracks, he'll release an album for charity - although he hasn't settled on a charity yet. ""It might be best to put that to a vote as well.""Few musicians haven't done online performances, which can have an intimate charm (but can also be quite dull, beyond the voyeuristic kick of having a nosey in their houses).Lightbody recommends fellow Northern Irish singer Roe, who could teach the bigger names a thing or two about audio and video quality.This was filmed in isolation with Jay Dickson on the drums. We thought this would be a cool thing to do right now seeing...End of Facebook post  by ROESome performers get their fans involved - whether by taking requests or doing Q&As, virtual charity festivals or tutorials like Duran Duran star John Taylor with his bass masterclasses and Oti Mabuse with her dance lessons.Listening parties have also been a big hit. Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess has carved out a sideline as host of #timstwitterlisteningparty. Fans and musicians listen together in real time, tweeting their thoughts and memories.""There's power in listening and knowing others are doing so at the same as you,"" Burgess told The Sunday Times.In the US, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland - who staged a song-for-song producer clash in 2018 - now run a regular lockdown face-off, inviting different stars to go head-to-head in weekly Verzuz battles on Instagram.Erykah Badu and Jill Scott's recent battle was more of a love-in, and drew 700,000 live viewers.The New York Times has called Verzuz ""perhaps the most powerful quarantine-friendly entertainment franchise going"".Beyond music, lockdown may turn out to be a tipping point for activities like quizzes, choirs, and exercise, yoga and cookery lessons, which have found new leases of life online (despite the inevitable loss of the human touch).In theatre, as in music, it's hard to replicate the live experience on screen. But some are using technology to create a new kind of show.Although monologues have been filmed in lockdown and pre-recorded shows have been put online, they often can't capture the excitement of being in an audience. Plus, the magical, fantastical storytelling of theatre doesn't translate well to the screen.""What doesn't work is watching streaming of plays on computers,"" playwright Simon Stephens told BBC Radio 4's Front Row last week. ""Whenever I watch those I just feel lonelier than I felt before.""What is interesting is when writers, directors, actors and designers start thinking about - what are the dramatic potentials of Zoom?""In recent weeks, creative types have been exploring just that.David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman and Denise Gough starred in A Separate Peace, a one-act play by Sir Tom Stoppard on Zoom.""I'm fascinated by the format, which is a completely new kind of way of putting on a play where paradoxically you stay home and live theatre comes to you,"" Sir Tom said.The show tried to replicate something of the live experience, with audience members buying a ticket in advance and turning up at an allotted time - the performance deliberately wasn't put online to watch afterwards.It had professional crew, including video, lighting, costume and sound designers, and the actors (all at home, obviously) entered and exited their quarters of the screen as they would a stage. ""The cast were saying they were so nervous, like 'I really felt like I was standing in the wings,'"" says producer Matt Humphrey.""We want to show other people that this can be done and give confidence to other people that live theatre still has a place during lockdown."" And he believes such Zoom-style shows will still have a place when quarantine lifts.The Guardian's five-star review declared: ""If, for however long, this is live theatre's future, then it works triumphantly.""Another Zoom theatre triumph got the audience fully involved from their sofas.In a playful version of The Tempest from Northern Ireland-based theatre company Big Telly and Oxford's Creation Theatre, viewers were asked to help out by doing things like making storm sound effects and pretending to be a flock of birds. The most enthusiastic were spotlighted on screen for the rest of the audience to see.Another show, Operation Elsewhere, was originally ""an immersive theatre game"" played in the real world.  When the world locked down, it was hastily reworked for Zoom - also with lots of audience participation.""People turn all the lights off and get under blankets because we need cover of darkness,"" Big Telly artistic director Zoe Seaton explains. ""There was one point where a character says, 'If you've got war paint get it on now', and you see people rushing to the kitchen and getting ketchup and things.""End of Youtube post  by Big TellyVirtual backgrounds and green screens can create settings and effects that would be difficult and expensive in real life. ""I'm really enjoying it because it feels like a new box of tricks, a new way of telling stories,"" Seaton says.People have been tuning in from around the world and using the shows to have a shared night ""out"" with separated family members.""The joy of seeing your nephew and niece in Canada doing something in the same show that you're part of has just been amazing,"" Seaton says. ""We're interested in taking that further.""We work in rural communities in Ireland mostly, as well as Belfast and Derry, and suddenly our audience are in Brooklyn, and you think, oh gosh!""The key has been inviting the audience to bring the shows to life, Seaton adds. ""They have had that sense of community that theatre has, where you're all on the same journey. ""That's their main success. I think that's what people are missing in lockdown - that sense of community.""",18 May 2020,entertainment
The Night Watch: Will Gompertz reviews the Rijksmuseum's high tech photo ★★★★★,"At 9am on Tuesday the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam posted an image of Rembrandt's The Night Watch (1642) on its website.

But there was something about this particular photo that made it stand out just like the little girl in a gold dress in Rembrandt's famous group portrait of local civic guardsmen. The web image presents the painting unframed on a dark grey background. It looks sharp and well-lit but not exceptional in terms of photography. Until, that is, you click on it, at which point you're zoomed in a bit closer. Click again and you're propelled towards the outstretched hand of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq. Another click, and you're face-to-face with the leader of this group of not-so-merry-men. Once more, and you can see the glint in his eye and the texture of his ginger beard. At no point does the image start to pixelate or distort, it's pin-sharp throughout. And it remains so as you continue to click, getting further and further into the painting until the Captain's paint-cracked eyeball is the size of a fist, and you realise that tiny glint you first saw isn't the result of one dab of Rembrandt's brush, but four separate applications, each loaded with a slightly different shade of paint. And then you stop and think: Crikey, Rembrandt actually used four different colours to paint a minuscule light effect in the eye of one of the many life-sized protagonists featured in this group portrait, which probably wouldn't be seen by anybody anyway. Or, maybe, this visionary 17th Century Dutchman foresaw a future where the early experiments with camera obscura techniques, in which he might have dabbled, would eventually lead to a photographic technology capable of recording a visual representation of his giant canvas to a level of detail beyond the eyesight of even the artist himself! It is, quite frankly, amazing.  For instance, I've always liked the ghostly dog that turns and snarls at the drummer situated at the edge of the painting. I'd assumed the hound was unfinished and therefore unloved by Rembrandt, but now I can see by zooming in that the artist not only gave the dog a stylish collar, but also added a gold pendant with a tiny flash of red paint to echo the colour of the trousers worn by the drummer. Clearly, Rembrandt was pro-dogs.As always there is artifice behind the art, as you will see within moments of zooming into The Night Watch. It quickly becomes apparent that Rembrandt first created his wonderfully dynamic composition, and then fine-tuned it as he went along. You will spot lots of small shadowy corrections (pentimenti) he made, such as the top of the drummer's stick on the far right, or on the index finger of the Ensign holding the Troop's flag aloft. There is artifice in the photograph, too. It is not a single image as it appears, but a composite of 528 individual digital photographs that have been seamlessly stitched together to give us a completely new view of one the most famous paintings in western art.Let's zoom out for a moment. Rembrandt signed, dated and called his painting:  Officers and Men of the Amsterdam Kloveniers Militia, the Company of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq.It was a commissioned portrait by the Kloveniers Militia (a sort of Dad's Army of locals) to hang in their HQ. Those featured (probably 18 members originally) each paid to be included. Capt Cocq takes centre stage, with his trusty Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch to his side. The men gathered behind them are carrying an assortment of weapons with which to defend their neighbourhood. Muskets (Klover) were their speciality, a point Rembrandt illustrates with a surreal sequence running left to right across the picture featuring three musketeers. The first, dressed in red with white collar and cuffs, is loading his musket with gunpowder. The second, a young boy, partially obscured by Cocq's right arm, fires his gun, ruffling the feathers of Ruytenburch's hat but not the man himself, who one has to assume is stone deaf. And then, there's the third, an older man also dressed in red, blowing away the spent powder from the fired gun. The young girl in the gold dress is not a member of the militia, but is there as their shining symbolic mascot. The upturned feet of the dead chicken hanging from her belt represent the Kloveniers' golden claw emblem. The painting initially hung with several other huge group portraits, giving visitors to the troops' inner sanctum the sense of being surrounded by local muscle. It was subsequently moved in 1715 to the Town Hall on the Dam (now the Royal Palace), where it was trimmed on all four sides to fit between the doors. It was first called The Night Watch in 1897, when the varnish applied to protect the paint had become so old and stained the picture looked like a nocturnal scene. That layer of varnish was removed long ago in one of the 25 or more restorations and treatments The Night Watch has undergone over the years. The most memorable being in 1975 after a visitor to the museum attacked the painting with a knife, causing severe damage, traces of which you can see when you zoom in on the new composite photograph: An act of art historical sleuthing which is the digital photo's primary purpose. The 44.8 Gigapixel image was created for the Rijksmuseum's conservation department, which is currently embarked upon the most exhaustive facelift The Night Watch has probably ever endured.  It enables the team of 12 to look right into the picture without using microscopes, in order to see what work needs to be done. A huge amount is the answer. Zoom in and you'll detect plenty of cracked paint, which is to be expected. But zero in on the Captain's and Lieutenant's faces and you will notice they're covered in blackheads. That's not because they didn't know one end of a bath from the other - they were sophisticated chaps - it is probably down to aging white paint particles, the tops of which have broken off to reveal a dark inner. There are thousands of these pinprick blemishes, all of which conservators should be able to reverse, bringing an even greater liveliness to an already lively painting. The Night Watch is an incredible work of art. Soon, you will be able to stand in front of it once again when the Rijksmuseum re-opens on the 1 June (caveat: there will be vastly reduced number of admissions, and The Night Watch is currently encased in a glass box - still visible but not as approachable).  And if and when you do see it for real, you will immediately notice Rembrandt's exaggerated use of light and shade to create a sense of drama, aided and abetted by an all-action composition emphasised by teaming diagonal lines. The Night Watch is as close to theatre as a painting can get. As the director of the Rijksmuseum said, it is a school photo taken before everybody is lined up in order (it shows Capt. Cocq instructing Lt. Ruytenburch to bring his men to attention). It captures a moment of movement and mayhem.You can see that when in front of the canvas. But when you are not, when you're at home, you can now see the same sense of chaos in the way Rembrandt painted his masterpiece, made when he was at the peak of his fame, just at the time his beloved wife was dying and his life took a turn for the worse. The further you look into it the greater the mess appears to be. Splodges of impasto paint here, unfinished transitions there. It's a mixture of early Rembrandt tautness and late Rembrandt looseness. If you thought Van Gogh or Jackson Pollock invented expressionistic painting, you'll think again when you've zoomed into The Night Watch. It is a sight to behold. A magnificent sight, which extends our knowledge of a truly great work of art, whether you're an old timer or a first timer. New technology is often used to try to jazz up old art, which is generally a bad idea. But, the Rijksmuseum is using technology to increase our understanding and appreciation of a Golden Age great, and that is a good idea. As you can see.

How some stars are helping music's unsung heroes in lockdown,"Whether they're guitar players, backing vocalists or studio engineers, career musicians struggle with pay even in regular times. Many take on extra work to make ends meet when their services aren't needed on stage or in the studio.For them, the Covid-19 pandemic has been a double whammy. Not only have tours and recording sessions been put on hold, but those second jobs in wedding bands or school classrooms have vanished, too.According to a Musicians Union survey, 92% of its members have seen their livelihood affected by coronavirus, losing an estimated £13.9m in earnings in the first two weeks of the lockdown.Meanwhile, the Ivors Academy of songwriters and composers said it anticipated a loss of £25,000 per member over a six-month period.The figures may come as a surprise, given recent headlines about record-breaking royalty payments and Rihanna's £468m fortune, but the wealth in the music industry tends to accumulate at the top.For the rest, the ""industry has ground to a halt,"" says Olga FitzRoy, an award-winning engineer and producer whose credits include Coldplay, Foo Fighters and The Beatles.""I did my last session in the first week of March and I've had nothing since then, and my colleagues are pretty much in the same boat,"" she tells the BBC. ""There's no money coming in"".In the midst of the pandemic, however, some artists are finding ways to support their sidemen and women - and hoping they can establish new precedents along the way.In Paris, jazz artist Melody Gardot is making a new record from her apartment, and inviting musicians from around the world to form her ""virtual orchestra"".Anyone can sign up - and they'll receive musical charts, backing tracks and instructions with on how to record themselves performing at home.Crucially, however, she is paying standard union rates to anyone who appears on the finished record. ""The reality is I can't do what I do without those musicians,"" the Grammy nominee tells the BBC.""If I stand on stage by myself, it's way less interesting than if I have a beautiful array of colours to offer. So these people are equally important and we can't forget about them during this time."" I want to contribute something unique to this new movement of ‘connection despite distance’. During this complicated time, we miss essential connections with one other.  We miss hugs, we miss our family, our friends......in short we miss love. So I want to make a love project to help break the feeling of isolation between us. Join me in the first step of this new project “From Paris with Love” by submitting the following: 1. Film a 5 second “video-portrait”, of yourself.  Film it HORIZONTALLY, and make sure we can see enough of you (chest to head) and with a fixed camera (it’s like taking a picture but 5 seconds long and in video format). Dont move too much :) Just pose and record with some natural light in front of a *NEUTRAL BACKGROUND* wearing *SOLID BLACK OR WHITE* tee shirt only please. 2. HANDWRITTEN horizontally, using a large black sharpie or black crayon on a white piece of paper (standard A4 format suggested) say “From (wherever you are) With Love”. Scan or photograph the paper (highest quality possible) and send ! 3. SEND both items (your photo scan and your video) to the email address : frompariswithloveproject@gmail.com **In your email please include your Instagram handle (if you have one) so we can find you later. After receiving these things, we’ll put together a surprising collaborative video clip featuring all your submissions alongside a new piece of music called “From Paris with Love”. A large portion my royalties from this song will be donated to a Covid relief charity to help medical workers during this time. This way, we share as much love as we possibly can together. **Please remember if you send this along it means you’re okay for me to for use your image in this project, so think about breaking the ‘quarantine pijama’ uniform if you don’t want everybody to see you that way ! Your mom and mine will see this ;) Full T&Cs here https://decca.lnk.to/termsandconditions We’re only collecting these over the next few days - so please don’t wait too long. Feel free to pass this message along. This is just the first step of this collaborative journey so stay tuned..... ❤️ With love, from Paris Frompariswithloveproject@gmail.comA post shared by  Melody Gardot (@melodygardotofficial) on Apr 29, 2020 at 8:31am PDTEnd of Instagram post  by melodygardotofficialSo far, Gardot has received submissions from players in ""Croatia, Santa Monica, France and England,"" ranging from top-level professionals to ""an 11-year-old girl who really wants to be a musician"".Her song, With Love From Paris, is a sumptuous, melancholy ballad whose refrain - ""maybe one day I will see you soon"" - pre-dates the lockdown, but has taken on added resonance over the last eight weeks.She decided to ask out-of-work musicians to complete the track after recalling the long weekends she would spend playing piano bars in Philadelphia as a teenager.""I remember playing gigs for food, just to get dinner,"" she remembers. "" Then it got a little better and I do the gig to get 25 bucks and then 50. I was hustling, you know? And I know musicians are in that place right now. ""They don't know how they're going to get by, they need to put some bread on the table, and all of a sudden, not only can they contribute [to this song], doing something they love, but at the end of the day, there's a pay check coming in.""Gardot isn't the only artist leveraging her influence to help others. Pop star Charli XCX has spent the last six weeks recording a new album from scratch in her house - partly to keep herself sane, but also because she realised her regular collaborators would be struggling to make ends meet.""There are a lot of other creative people who can't work during this time,"" she told the BBC last month. ""So, for me, doing this project is also a way to support some of those people, whether that be video editors, or the painters who are doing my artwork, or 3D designers, or video directors.""Indie band The National are donating all profits from their merchandise store to their road crew; while Good Charlotte's Joel and Benji Madden have re-tooled their e-commerce site Veeps to help other bands raise money.The site, which started out as a way to market VIP packages for concert tours, now allows artists to sell tickets to streaming online gigs. So far, it's been embraced by musicians like Angel Olsen, Bat For Lashes and All Time Low, who've used the income to support their touring crew, raise money for charity or offset lost earnings.Typically, the artists are those who can't afford to stage pro-bono live-streams on Instagram - or who are wary of Facebook and Spotify's ""tipping"" systems, which can both produce varying results.All of these ideas are all still taking shape, but they're going to prove crucial if the industry is to survive.Gardot says she hopes other artists will follow her lead in paying musicians for recording their parts at home.""We got to get some of the big cats on board, like John Mayer or Ed Sheeran, and keep creating opportunities for other people,"" she says.That could be crucial, says FitzRoy, as it could be a long time before things return to normal. Although recording studios could re-open in June, with an initial backlog of work to get through, the picture is a little less rosy further down the line.""There's no live work, so a lot of artists won't have had any income, so they won't be able to afford to make records,"" she says. ""And the fact that film production has ground to a halt means that, in six months' time, those projects that should have been recording scores at the big studios just won't be happening.""So there'll be a little bump of activity when things resume, but the longer-term effects are going to be with us for the next couple of years.""Echoing calls made by UK Music earlier this week, FitzRoy says the government should work closely with the industry to make sure it survives as the UK emerges from lockdown.""The music industry makes a lot of money for them in the good times,"" she says. ""They need to think about that.""",14 May 2020,entertainment
BBC Three could return as an on-air channel,"The BBC is hoping to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel, four years after it was taken off air and moved online.The youth channel, which commissioned hits like Normal People and Fleabag, will also have its budget doubled.It left linear TV in 2016 to save £30m, and because the corporation said young people were watching more shows online.The BBC now says it is ""considering the case"" for returning the channel to ""linear television"".A BBC spokesman said ""we'd be wrong not to back a service that is doing better than anyone could have ever conceived"".The turnaround will be formally announced as part of the BBC's annual plan on Wednesday, but there was no news about the fate of BBC Four, which has been rumoured for the axe.The corporation warned that putting BBC Three back on TV will mean reductions in other areas, especially as the BBC's income has been reduced by £125 million during the coronavirus outbreak. But it says those decisions won't be made until the autumn when there is a clearer picture of the BBC's finances. However, the BBC did say it had no plans to close BBC Four at the moment.BBC Three launched in 2003 and made its name with hits like Little Britain and Gavin & Stacey.In recent years, it has also been behind comedy and drama successes like This Country, People Just Do Nothing, My Left Nut and the Bafta-winning Killed By My Debt.It has also made the reality shows RuPaul's Drag Race UK and Glow Up; as well as hard-hitting documentaries like Stacey Dooley's investigations and Jesy Nelson's Odd One Out.Normal People, an adaptation of the Sally Rooney novel, recently propelled BBC Three to its biggest ever week on iPlayer, with 21.8 million requests for the channel's programmes.Its shows have been aired on regular TV as well as online, including in a dedicated zone on BBC One after the News At Ten since last spring.When it moved online in February 2016, the BBC Trust said ""independent evidence shows younger audiences are watching more online and watching less linear TV"".But BBC Three reached 8% of British 16-34-year-olds per week in 2018/19, down from 22% in 2015/16.The BBC now says its research shows there is a potential large linear audience for the channel's programmes, which it says are reaching both young people and the wider audience in ""big numbers"".The news comes two months after director general Tony Hall told MPs the board was looking to ""divert more resources into BBC Three to build the kind of creative content they're delivering"".But with the corporation needing to make savings, there has been speculation that BBC Four may be among the casualties.A petition calling for the channel to be saved has attracted more than 58,000 signatures.",19 May 2020,entertainment
BBC launches tool for joint lockdown viewing,"If you've been wishing you could enjoy a TV or radio show with friends during lockdown, the BBC is trialling a tool to allow just that.BBC Together lets you watch or listen to content from BBC iPlayer, Sounds, Bitesize, News and Sport in sync with other people using different devices.It is available through the BBC's experimental website Taster.BBC R&D's Dr Libby Miller said being separate ""doesn't mean we can't enjoy great programmes with our friends"".She added: ""We wanted to see if technology could bring people together to watch and listen to BBC shows remotely as a shared experience.""The ""host"" of the group can send a link from the BBC Together site, then control when to play and pause so everyone sees the same thing at the same time. A maximum number of 50 people can join.The BBC said the coronavirus lockdown had led to a surge in use of the iPlayer.Netflix Party, a Google Chrome extension that offers a similar but unofficial service for Netflix, also allows people to synchronise their viewing.For YouTube, Vimeo and other content, there's Watch2Gether, while Kast supports all the major streaming services.Dr Miller stressed that BBC Together was ""just a test at this stage"".""We'll be monitoring how well it works and thinking about how we could change it in the future, but we're looking forward to seeing and hearing about the creative ways that people use it and getting their feedback on Taster,"" she said.",19 May 2020,entertainment

Coronavirus: Travis McCready plays America's first gig in months,"Country musician Travis McCready played to an audience wearing face masks in what's been described as the first US concert since the Covid-19 lockdown.The gig, in Arkansas, offered a glimpse of how live music could resume in the UK, with compulsory temperature tests and social distancing for all present.Concert-goers were required to buy seats in clusters, branded ""fan pods"", and large areas were roped off.""It's just nice to be doing something that's normal,"" said one attendee.McCready's concert was originally scheduled for Friday, 15 May, in Fort Smith, Arkansas, but Governor Asa Hutchinson said it failed to meet the state's public health standards.The venue - a former Masonic temple called TempleLive - was threatened with a cease-and-desist order and had its alcohol licence revoked.But after making adjustments to their concert plan, the venue received permission to stage the concert on Monday night.Under the state-approved plan, all employees and audience members over the age of 10 were required to wear face coverings, and performers were instructed to maintain a minimum distance of 12 feet from the audience.The state also allowed TempleLive to have 239 people seated in the 1,100-seat venue.After receiving the go-ahead, representatives from the venue maintained they had delayed the concert against their will.""This is about rock and roll, and having a good time, and live music, and being out with your peers, and doing what you do as an American: You get out, you do things,"" Mike Brown told reporters at Arkansas TV station KFSM-TV.Speaking to the New York Times, Mr Brown also argued that concert venues were being held to stricter standards than other public gatherings.""If you can go to a church and it's a public assembly, there is no difference,"" said Mike Brown, a representative for Temple Live. ""How is it OK for one group to have a public meeting, and it's not OK for a music venue to have the same opportunity?""State officials argued that a concert was more dangerous than a religious gathering because it was more likely to attract visitors from out-of-town.When the show finally went ahead on Monday night, Mr Brown greeted the audience by playing the Beastie Boys' Fight For Your Right (To Party) before introducing support act Lauren Brown.McCready took to the stage later, without referencing the strange circumstances. Nonetheless, fans seemed to appreciate the show.""We're happy to be here,"" said LaLisa Smiddy, who drove four hours to attend the concert. ""I'm one of the more paranoid ones out there, and when I saw everything this venue has done, I was ready to come,"" she told the New York Times. ""I think they've done an outstanding job.""However, McCready's show is unlikely to kickstart a return to live music just yet, with most experts predicting that large-scale shows will not resume before the end of 2020.In the UK, many small venues are at risk of closure due to the sudden lack of income, prompting the Music Venue Trust to launch a ""Save Our Venues"" fundraising campaign last month.The initiative has raised £1.5m so far, meaning 140 venues have been temporarily saved from the threat of imminent closure.""This is a good start,"" said CEO Mark Davyd, ""but we cannot relax as we still have a mountain to climb to secure the long-term future of this sector. ""We still desperately need more music industry companies to step up and help with donations alongside real action from government specifically around rent relief, more financial help and clearer guidance.""",19 May 2020,entertainment
