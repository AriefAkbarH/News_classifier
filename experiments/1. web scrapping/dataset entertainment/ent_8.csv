Ariana Grande reflects on Manchester bombing ahead of anniversary,"Ariana Grande has sent a heartfelt message to fans ahead of the third anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing.The pop star had just finished playing at the venue on 22 May, 2017, when a terrorist detonated a homemade explosive device, killing 22 people.Writing on Instagram, Grande shared a message of solidarity with the victims.""Not a day goes by that this doesn't affect you and all of us still,"" the 26-year-old wrote.""I will be thinking of you all week and weekend.""Acknowledging ""the sadness and tremendous heaviness of the anniversary"", she added: ""My heart, thoughts, prayers are with you always."" The star signed off with a black heart and a bee emoji. The bee, representing Manchester's industrial past, became a symbol of hope in the wake of the attack.Grande, who said she suffered PTSD as a result of the atrocity, returned to Manchester last year to headline the city's Pride festival.The bombing was carried out by Manchester-born Salman Abedi. The youngest of those who died was eight years old. Almost 1,000 people were injured.The terrorist's brother, Hashem Abedi, was convicted of murder earlier this year for his role in planning the attacks. His sentencing has been postponed due to travel restrictions in place due to the coronavirus.The pandemic has also affected plans for this year's memorial to the victims, with social-distancing measures putting a halt on church services.It means Manchester Cathedral will have to broadcast two services on its Facebook page, urging people to log on at home rather than attend in person like previous years.""Before the restrictions, it was really important we had connectedness and reached out, family and friends, but also the wider community, to come together,"" said Figen Murray, whose son Martyn Hett died in the attack.""We can't do that this year. It's going to be very strange.""I'm normally a really robust and resilient person, but I've had so much time on my hands. I'm struggling a bit.""I can't have people to visit, it is very raw. I have noticed I am very reflective, I dream a lot.""Instead, Mr Hett's family and friends will join a group chat on the video conferencing app Zoom, raising a toast to the 29-year-old PR manager from their homes.Mrs Murray said: ""Zoom will do this year. Since the pandemic, we have all had to adapt and I think that shows how strong the human spirit is."" ",21 May 2020,entertainment

ABC figures: Newspapers will no longer have to publish sales,"Newspapers will no longer have their sales figures automatically published, the industry's auditor has said.The Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC), which records and audits sales, usually publishes figures every month.But ABC said publishers were growing concerned about a ""negative narrative of decline"" in newspaper sales.The decision comes as figures due to be released on Thursday were expected to show a significant drop in sales amid the coronavirus pandemic.Newspapers were already suffering falling print sales, and stories about the gradual decline of newspapers have been common in recent years.The Guardian's media editor Jim Waterson said: ""This is a genius move. Can't write about the decline in print newspaper sales if there's no longer evidence that print newspaper sales are actually declining!""Entirely coincidentally, pre-Covid this was due to be the month the Sun lost its title as UK's biggest selling newspaper after 40+ years to Daily Mail.

As a result, newspapers will be able to tell advertisers what their sales are, regardless of whether or not they are made public.Phil Smith, Director General of ISBA, which represents UK advertisers, said he ""fully supported"" the changes.""These reporting updates will reduce the tendency for circulation to be seen as the only measure of Newsbrands' health in our multi-platform age,"" he said.Newspapers have dramatically expanded their online operations in recent years in an effort to increase income from internet advertising.Analysis by David Sillito, media correspondentIt has been a difficult month for the newspapers. Traffic to websites may have risen but most papers are still heavily dependent on sales of print and many have seen a drop of around 30% over the last few weeks. And it is not just sales revenue that has dropped, print advertising has also taken a nosedive. But the decision to allow these figures to be a private matter between newspapers and advertisers is part of a bigger issue. It's no secret the print newspaper business has been in long-term decline. Some are falling faster than others but over the last few years most have seen annual drops of around 7%. The question for many is not if but when they stop the printing presses.   However, some papers, such as the New York Times, are showing that there may be a future with digital subscriptions. Digital advertising may also be a long term solution for some.  There are other ways then of measuring a news organisation's success and today's decision reflects that fact.   But this ever, it is also a little moment in the history of the British press.

‘I wrote my wife a poem every day for 25 years’,"Actor Peter Gordon put a love poem under his wife Alison's pillow every day for 25 years. He has kept writing for her since her death, and his family have now put his poems online.Peter Gordon has raised the bar for romantic gestures.While most men think doing more than buying a bunch of flowers once in a while is going the extra mile, he penned 8,500 poems over several decades about the life and love he shared with Alison.The gesture is both grand and sweetly intimate, and the poems form a remarkable chronicle of domestic devotion, passion and bliss.If Peter's not the most romantic bloke alive, they suggest he's been one of the luckiest.Peter started writing the poems in the 1980s, but they became a daily fixture in 1990, and remained so until her death from lung cancer in 2016.""She was very touched and used to look forward to it,"" he recalls.""It started off as little notes and then little poems. I would put them under her pillow, she would come to bed, look under the pillow, give it to me, and I would read it to her.""Then I'd give it to her and she would read it silently and then fold it up and put it back under the pillow.""Around 340 poems from his vast archive have now been put online by their daughters Cassie, a charity content creator, and Anna, a writer who has worked on Succession and Killing Eve.Some of the poems are recited in accompanying videos by actors like Julie Hesmondhalgh and Pearl Mackie.End of Youtube post  by A Love In VerseSome are simplistic and light-hearted: ""This universal love is Pete's / I love her more than fruity sweets.""Others go deeper: ""Our love's no steady / Stream of light, but brilliant sparks / Flying off endlessly in the gloom / And glorious.""Together, they act as a biography in verse, including recollections about the moment Peter was hit by Cupid's arrow while appearing in a play with Alison in Edinburgh in 1973 (""Still the arrows rain each day / Looks like Cupid's here to stay!"")""She was lovely,"" he now remembers. ""She was quite forthright in her opinions, which I always admired.""She was an actor like me, so that attracted me - a very good actor. She was just kind, assured in a sense, but we were both a little lost when we met.""As the family grew, the poems conveyed the contentment of being together in their ""wild, tangled"" home in Brentford, west London, ""secure against the world and weather"".Peter, now 87, trained at Rada and performed at the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and has TV and film credits including Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit and Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason.Alison appeared in early 1970s sitcom The Lovers among other shows, and went on to be a successful director and drama teacher.Peter's writing describes the emptiness of being separated when one of them was away with work - and the excitement of speeding home to Alison on the 391 bus: ""Through star - and streetlight - I must kiss or die!"" But it also reflects his constant struggle to make ends meet as a jobbing actor. ""I was obsessed with earning enough money to keep the family going and the home going,"" he says.In his poems, he decides there's more to life, however: ""Love, for which God I thank / Is the source of true content, the currency, the means / To restore the balance: it's money in the bank.""It's not simply a plain-sailing love story - like everyone, Peter and Alison had their ups and downs (""The Earth's not flat / Neither is life"").But the arguments were never serious, he says, and writing poems even on bad days took the ""sting"" out of the quarrels.Peter seemingly even found Alison's snoring ""graceful"". Snoring comes up more than once - daughter Cassie, who has typed up the poems, has a favourite line: ""Roar away my feisty snorer.""""There are a lot about mum's feet and hair,"" says Cassie.""And eyes,"" Peter adds. ""They were perfect.""Alison's blue eyes do feature heavily. ""Rembrandt couldn't catch those eyes / Nor Raphael each luscious curve.""As does her bottom. ""I dwell upon it constantly / Two rounded hillocks of real class.""End of Youtube post 2 by A Love In VerseIn 2015, the poems took a more reflective and darker turn after Alison was diagnosed with cancer. When she died, he continued writing, although not daily.In those poems, the emptiness is excruciating. One, in which he imagines a walk with her, sums up both the joy of their life and the pain of her absence:""She hangs on my arm or we go hand in hand / And we chat - well, she's sending me up half the time / Or we're making up songs and trying to rhyme / And laughing sometimes when the words haven't scanned.""He's only brought back to reality when her voice tells him: ""Even the fondest, it can't be denied / May forget now and then - it's a year since I died.""After her death, Peter sorted through the poems in the shed of the house he now shares with Cassie, and picked out the best to go online.He says: ""I've been reading through them again, for what we're doing, and I find some of them make me cry, or nearly cry.""Some make me laugh. There's always a lot of humour.""The poems were published for the first time on the website, A Love In Verse, on the fourth anniversary of Alison's death last week.""I want to honour the love that we had, and I think it's worth letting people know about it,"" Peter says. ""I think it's a good thing, especially in these difficult times.""When we came up with this whole idea, it was quite long ago, long before the lock-in.

Ruby Rose leaves Batwoman - and other stars who exited major roles,"The Australian actress Ruby Rose is to leave her role as comic book superhero Batwoman after just one series.Rose said it had been a ""very difficult decision"" not to return to the show, which is shown in the UK on E4.Batwoman, which began on the CW network last year, is the first superhero show to have an openly gay lead character.Its producers said they were ""firmly committed"" to the show's ""long-term"" future and would re-cast the role with another member of the LGBTQ community.Rose, who is herself gay, said she was ""truly grateful... to everyone who made season one a success"". The 34-year-old said she had ""the utmost respect"" for everyone involved and that the decision to leave had not been ""made lightly"".Rose faced a backlash on social media when she was cast as Batwoman, with some saying the role should have gone to a lesbian actress.The actress, who has called herself ""gender-fluid"" in interviews, later deleted her Twitter profile, though she remains active on Instagram.Last year Rose revealed she had suffered an injury while filming the series that had required her to undergo emergency surgery.The actress said she had ""herniated two discs doing stunts"" - but Deadline reported the injury was not the reason for her departure.Born in Melbourne in 1986, Rose played Stella Carlin in Orange is the New Black and has appeared in such films as Pitch Perfect 3 and The Meg.Yet she is far from the first actor to leave or be replaced in a major film or TV show.George Lazenby famously walked away from the role of James Bond after making just one appearance in the popular spy film series.The model turned actor later admitted he had been persuaded by his then-manager - the late Ronan O'Rahilly - to seek other opportunities.""I thought he knew what he was talking about so I listened to him,"" the Australian told an audience at the National Film Theatre last year.Lazenby's single outing as Bond, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was released in 1969 and is now a firm fan favourite.Christopher Eccleston was cast as The Doctor when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 - but he departed after a single series.The actor, who was replaced by David Tennant, later said he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture"" of the show.""My relationship with my three immediate superiors... broke down irreparably during the first block of filming and it never recovered,"" he elaborated in 2018.The actor, currently to be seen in The A Word on BBC One, also said he had been ""out of his comfort zone"" playing the sci-fi drama's time-travelling hero.Edward Norton was cast as Bruce Banner in 2008's The Incredible Hulk but did not reprise the role in Marvel Studios' subsequent comic-book blockbusters.Its president Kevin Feige later said the role had been recast out of a ""need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members"".Speaking last year, Norton called Feige's 2010 statement ""cheap"" and that his exit had been the result of differing views on how to depict the character.""Ultimately they weren't going for long, dark and serious,"" said Norton, who was replaced by Mark Ruffalo when The Hulk returned in 2012's Avengers Assemble.Terrence Howard, who played James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in 2008's Iron Man, is another actor to be replaced in Marvel's superhero film series.He later claimed he was offered less money than he had been promised to reprise the role, which Don Cheadle has played since 2010's Iron Man 2.Sharon Gless played Christine Cagney in Cagney and Lacey for seven years, winning two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for her pains.Yet she was not the first actress to play the part in the popular US TV series about two female police detectives solving crimes in New York City.Loretta Swit played Cagney in the original TV movie but was not able to continue in the role when the CBS show went to series.Meg Foster was then cast, only to be replaced after six episodes because CBS allegedly wanted someone ""more feminine"" in the role.Speaking in 2012, Gless praised her co-star Tyne Daly for ""welcoming me as if she had not had anybody before me"".""I know her heart was hurting because she loved her last Cagney,"" she revealed.When Men Behaving Badly first began in 1992, the two flatmates were played by Martin Clunes and Harry Enfield.According to Clunes, though, the show that ITV produced did not match Enfield's hopes for it.""His original vision was for it not to be like a usual sitcom,"" Clunes told The Guardian in 2013. ""Then we made the pilot and it shocked him.""You could see Harry wanted out,"" he continued. ""He was under contract, though, so had to do one series.""Neil Morrissey was subsequently cast as Clunes' flatmate in the show, which continued on ITV for another series before being picked up by the BBC.Jodie Foster earned her second best actress Oscar for playing Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs - one of five Academy Awards Jonathan Demme's film won in 1992.When the offer came to reprise her role in Hannibal, though, she turned it down - opening the door for Julianne Moore to appear with Anthony Hopkins in Ridley Scott's 2001 follow-up.""I stand to make more money doing that sequel than I've ever made in my life,"" Foster was quoted as saying in 1999. ""But who cares, if it betrays Clarice?""""The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie,"" she elaborated in 2005. ""So I get to say, in a nice, dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot.""Amusingly, however, Foster was enticed to reprise her FBI agent character in 2017 for a satirical sketch on Stephen Colbert's late-night US talk show.End of Youtube post  by The Late Show with Stephen ColbertYou may also like:",20 May 2020,entertainment

The 34-year-old said she had ""the utmost respect"" for everyone involved and that the decision to leave had not been ""made lightly"".Rose faced a backlash on social media when she was cast as Batwoman, with some saying the role should have gone to a lesbian actress.The actress, who has called herself ""gender-fluid"" in interviews, later deleted her Twitter profile, though she remains active on Instagram.Last year Rose revealed she had suffered an injury while filming the series that had required her to undergo emergency surgery.The actress said she had ""herniated two discs doing stunts"" - but Deadline reported the injury was not the reason for her departure.Born in Melbourne in 1986, Rose played Stella Carlin in Orange is the New Black and has appeared in such films as Pitch Perfect 3 and The Meg.Yet she is far from the first actor to leave or be replaced in a major film or TV show.George Lazenby famously walked away from the role of James Bond after making just one appearance in the popular spy film series.The model turned actor later admitted he had been persuaded by his then-manager - the late Ronan O'Rahilly - to seek other opportunities.""I thought he knew what he was talking about so I listened to him,"" the Australian told an audience at the National Film Theatre last year.Lazenby's single outing as Bond, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was released in 1969 and is now a firm fan favourite.Christopher Eccleston was cast as The Doctor when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 - but he departed after a single series.The actor, who was replaced by David Tennant, later said he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture"" of the show.""My relationship with my three immediate superiors... broke down irreparably during the first block of filming and it never recovered,"" he elaborated in 2018.The actor, currently to be seen in The A Word on BBC One, also said he had been ""out of his comfort zone"" playing the sci-fi drama's time-travelling hero.Edward Norton was cast as Bruce Banner in 2008's The Incredible Hulk but did not reprise the role in Marvel Studios' subsequent comic-book blockbusters.Its president Kevin Feige later said the role had been recast out of a ""need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members"".Speaking last year, Norton called Feige's 2010 statement ""cheap"" and that his exit had been the result of differing views on how to depict the character.""Ultimately they weren't going for long, dark and serious,"" said Norton, who was replaced by Mark Ruffalo when The Hulk returned in 2012's Avengers Assemble.Terrence Howard, who played James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in 2008's Iron Man, is another actor to be replaced in Marvel's superhero film series.He later claimed he was offered less money than he had been promised to reprise the role, which Don Cheadle has played since 2010's Iron Man 2.Sharon Gless played Christine Cagney in Cagney and Lacey for seven years, winning two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for her pains.Yet she was not the first actress to play the part in the popular US TV series about two female police detectives solving crimes in New York City.Loretta Swit played Cagney in the original TV movie but was not able to continue in the role when the CBS show went to series.Meg Foster was then cast, only to be replaced after six episodes because CBS allegedly wanted someone ""more feminine"" in the role.Speaking in 2012, Gless praised her co-star Tyne Daly for ""welcoming me as if she had not had anybody before me"".""I know her heart was hurting because she loved her last Cagney,"" she revealed.When Men Behaving Badly first began in 1992, the two flatmates were played by Martin Clunes and Harry Enfield.According to Clunes, though, the show that ITV produced did not match Enfield's hopes for it.""His original vision was for it not to be like a usual sitcom,"" Clunes told The Guardian in 2013. ""Then we made the pilot and it shocked him.""You could see Harry wanted out,"" he continued. ""He was under contract, though, so had to do one series.""Neil Morrissey was subsequently cast as Clunes' flatmate in the show, which continued on ITV for another series before being picked up by the BBC.Jodie Foster earned her second best actress Oscar for playing Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs - one of five Academy Awards Jonathan Demme's film won in 1992.When the offer came to reprise her role in Hannibal, though, she turned it down - opening the door for Julianne Moore to appear with Anthony Hopkins in Ridley Scott's 2001 follow-up.""I stand to make more money doing that sequel than I've ever made in my life,"" Foster was quoted as saying in 1999. ""But who cares, if it betrays Clarice?""""The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie,"" she elaborated in 2005. ""So I get to say, in a nice, dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot.""Amusingly, however, Foster was enticed to reprise her FBI agent character in 2017 for a satirical sketch on Stephen Colbert's late-night US talk show.End of Youtube post  by The Late Show with Stephen ColbertYou may also like:",20 May 2020,entertainment
ABC figures: Newspapers will no longer have to publish sales,"Newspapers will no longer have their sales figures automatically published, the industry's auditor has said.The Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC), which records and audits sales, usually publishes figures every month.But ABC said publishers were growing concerned about a ""negative narrative of decline"" in newspaper sales.The decision comes as figures due to be released on Thursday were expected to show a significant drop in sales amid the coronavirus pandemic.Newspapers were already suffering falling print sales, and stories about the gradual decline of newspapers have been common in recent years.The Guardian's media editor Jim Waterson said: ""This is a genius move. Can't write about the decline in print newspaper sales if there's no longer evidence that print newspaper sales are actually declining!""Entirely coincidentally, pre-Covid this was due to be the month the Sun lost its title as UK's biggest selling newspaper after 40+ years to Daily Mail. Now we've... no idea,"" he added.Publishers will have their circulation figures audited by ABC. As a result, newspapers will be able to tell advertisers what their sales are, regardless of whether or not they are made public.Phil Smith, Director General of ISBA, which represents UK advertisers, said he ""fully supported"" the changes.""These reporting updates will reduce the tendency for circulation to be seen as the only measure of Newsbrands' health in our multi-platform age,"" he said.Newspapers have dramatically expanded their online operations in recent years in an effort to increase income from internet advertising.Analysis by David Sillito, media correspondentIt has been a difficult month for the newspapers. Traffic to websites may have risen but most papers are still heavily dependent on sales of print and many have seen a drop of around 30% over the last few weeks. And it is not just sales revenue that has dropped, print advertising has also taken a nosedive. But the decision to allow these figures to be a private matter between newspapers and advertisers is part of a bigger issue. It's no secret the print newspaper business has been in long-term decline. Some are falling faster than others but over the last few years most have seen annual drops of around 7%. The question for many is not if but when they stop the printing presses.   However, some papers, such as the New York Times, are showing that there may be a future with digital subscriptions. Digital advertising may also be a long term solution for some.  There are other ways then of measuring a news organisation's success and today's decision reflects that fact.   But this ever, it is also a little moment in the history of the British press. For years, the monthly sales figures were a proud boast to advertisers and politicians of a newspaper's power and reach. That era is over.",21 May 2020,entertainment
‘I wrote my wife a poem every day for 25 years’,"Actor Peter Gordon put a love poem under his wife Alison's pillow every day for 25 years. He has kept writing for her since her death, and his family have now put his poems online.Peter Gordon has raised the bar for romantic gestures.While most men think doing more than buying a bunch of flowers once in a while is going the extra mile, he penned 8,500 poems over several decades about the life and love he shared with Alison.The gesture is both grand and sweetly intimate, and the poems form a remarkable chronicle of domestic devotion, passion and bliss.If Peter's not the most romantic bloke alive, they suggest he's been one of the luckiest.Peter started writing the poems in the 1980s, but they became a daily fixture in 1990, and remained so until her death from lung cancer in 2016.""She was very touched and used to look forward to it,"" he recalls.""It started off as little notes and then little poems. I would put them under her pillow, she would come to bed, look under the pillow, give it to me, and I would read it to her.""Then I'd give it to her and she would read it silently and then fold it up and put it back under the pillow.""Around 340 poems from his vast archive have now been put online by their daughters Cassie, a charity content creator, and Anna, a writer who has worked on Succession and Killing Eve.Some of the poems are recited in accompanying videos by actors like Julie Hesmondhalgh and Pearl Mackie.End of Youtube post  by A Love In VerseSome are simplistic and light-hearted: ""This universal love is Pete's / I love her more than fruity sweets.""Others go deeper: ""Our love's no steady / Stream of light, but brilliant sparks / Flying off endlessly in the gloom / And glorious.""Together, they act as a biography in verse, including recollections about the moment Peter was hit by Cupid's arrow while appearing in a play with Alison in Edinburgh in 1973 (""Still the arrows rain each day / Looks like Cupid's here to stay!"")""She was lovely,"" he now remembers. ""She was quite forthright in her opinions, which I always admired.""She was an actor like me, so that attracted me - a very good actor. She was just kind, assured in a sense, but we were both a little lost when we met.""As the family grew, the poems conveyed the contentment of being together in their ""wild, tangled"" home in Brentford, west London, ""secure against the world and weather"".Peter, now 87, trained at Rada and performed at the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and has TV and film credits including Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit and Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason.Alison appeared in early 1970s sitcom The Lovers among other shows, and went on to be a successful director and drama teacher.Peter's writing describes the emptiness of being separated when one of them was away with work - and the excitement of speeding home to Alison on the 391 bus: ""Through star - and streetlight - I must kiss or die!"" But it also reflects his constant struggle to make ends meet as a jobbing actor. ""I was obsessed with earning enough money to keep the family going and the home going,"" he says.In his poems, he decides there's more to life, however: ""Love, for which God I thank / Is the source of true content, the currency, the means / To restore the balance: it's money in the bank.""It's not simply a plain-sailing love story - like everyone, Peter and Alison had their ups and downs (""The Earth's not flat / Neither is life"").But the arguments were never serious, he says, and writing poems even on bad days took the ""sting"" out of the quarrels.Peter seemingly even found Alison's snoring ""graceful"". Snoring comes up more than once - daughter Cassie, who has typed up the poems, has a favourite line: ""Roar away my feisty snorer.""""There are a lot about mum's feet and hair,"" says Cassie.""And eyes,"" Peter adds. ""They were perfect.""Alison's blue eyes do feature heavily. ""Rembrandt couldn't catch those eyes / Nor Raphael each luscious curve.""As does her bottom. ""I dwell upon it constantly / Two rounded hillocks of real class.""End of Youtube post 2 by A Love In VerseIn 2015, the poems took a more reflective and darker turn after Alison was diagnosed with cancer. When she died, he continued writing, although not daily.In those poems, the emptiness is excruciating. One, in which he imagines a walk with her, sums up both the joy of their life and the pain of her absence:""She hangs on my arm or we go hand in hand / And we chat - well, she's sending me up half the time / Or we're making up songs and trying to rhyme / And laughing sometimes when the words haven't scanned.""He's only brought back to reality when her voice tells him: ""Even the fondest, it can't be denied / May forget now and then - it's a year since I died.""After her death, Peter sorted through the poems in the shed of the house he now shares with Cassie, and picked out the best to go online.He says: ""I've been reading through them again, for what we're doing, and I find some of them make me cry, or nearly cry.""Some make me laugh. There's always a lot of humour.""The poems were published for the first time on the website, A Love In Verse, on the fourth anniversary of Alison's death last week.""I want to honour the love that we had, and I think it's worth letting people know about it,"" Peter says. ""I think it's a good thing, especially in these difficult times.""When we came up with this whole idea, it was quite long ago, long before the lock-in. I just thought they were quite good and I would like them as a memorial to Alison.""by Peter Gordon (7/11/1994)About the centre of the small loo window Leaves of every ivy-colour frameThe bold obtrusion of an autumn sunLeaf-jewels form along the vinesCherry-red shade and delicious green.There's no compounding of these oppositesEach surface either red or green or bearingEach separate - but look closer now and behold!Some leaves blend red and green in a strange shadeSubtle and lovely!

How live entertainment is evolving online to be a lifeline in lockdown,"From gigs to plays and quizzes, live entertainment has moved online during coronavirus lockdown - and creative minds are coming up with new ideas to give us back some of the human connection we've lost.Every Saturday for the past two months, Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has sat down and written a song.Well, he has co-written a song - with 5,000 fans on Instagram.He asks them for chords, comes up with melodies, and puts them to a vote. He then asks for ideas for lyrics before coming back an hour later with a finished track. ""Some are really good,"" he says. End of Youtube post  by Snow PatrolLightbody also performs solo online gigs from home, but wanted to do something more collaborative too.""You can say absolutely anything in this. It's therapeutic and cathartic for me,"" he explains.""In a 'gig', I chat a little bit, but you can't really read the comments because you're playing songs. But with this, it feels like you're engaging with everybody.""The fans also vote for the set lists in his regular online concerts. ""I could just choose a bunch of songs that I want to play, which I did do one week and it just didn't really work,"" Lightbody says. ""It just felt a little disconnected.""I miss playing live, I do. But it's going to be a long time, so this is what we've got.""With the communal thrill of congregating in the same room currently out of the question, Lightbody is among the artists to have come up with interesting ways to bring people together.When his Saturday Songwrite sessions have generated 10 or 12 decent tracks, he'll release an album for charity - although he hasn't settled on a charity yet. ""It might be best to put that to a vote as well.""Few musicians haven't done online performances, which can have an intimate charm (but can also be quite dull, beyond the voyeuristic kick of having a nosey in their houses).Lightbody recommends fellow Northern Irish singer Roe, who could teach the bigger names a thing or two about audio and video quality.This was filmed in isolation with Jay Dickson on the drums. We thought this would be a cool thing to do right now seeing...End of Facebook post  by ROESome performers get their fans involved - whether by taking requests or doing Q&As, virtual charity festivals or tutorials like Duran Duran star John Taylor with his bass masterclasses and Oti Mabuse with her dance lessons.Listening parties have also been a big hit. Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess has carved out a sideline as host of #timstwitterlisteningparty. Fans and musicians listen together in real time, tweeting their thoughts and memories.""There's power in listening and knowing others are doing so at the same as you,"" Burgess told The Sunday Times.In the US, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland - who staged a song-for-song producer clash in 2018 - now run a regular lockdown face-off, inviting different stars to go head-to-head in weekly Verzuz battles on Instagram.Erykah Badu and Jill Scott's recent battle was more of a love-in, and drew 700,000 live viewers.The New York Times has called Verzuz ""perhaps the most powerful quarantine-friendly entertainment franchise going"".Last night's #VERZUZ was special ✨ Thank you @fatbellybella and @missjillscott 🙏@Timbaland @THEREALSWIZZZ pic.twitter.com/8iOLySRompEnd of Twitter post  by @verzuzonlineBeyond music, lockdown may turn out to be a tipping point for activities like quizzes, choirs, and exercise, yoga and cookery lessons, which have found new leases of life online (despite the inevitable loss of the human touch).In theatre, as in music, it's hard to replicate the live experience on screen. But some are using technology to create a new kind of show.Although monologues have been filmed in lockdown and pre-recorded shows have been put online, they often can't capture the excitement of being in an audience. Plus, the magical, fantastical storytelling of theatre doesn't translate well to the screen.""What doesn't work is watching streaming of plays on computers,"" playwright Simon Stephens told BBC Radio 4's Front Row last week. ""Whenever I watch those I just feel lonelier than I felt before.""What is interesting is when writers, directors, actors and designers start thinking about - what are the dramatic potentials of Zoom?""In recent weeks, creative types have been exploring just that.David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman and Denise Gough starred in A Separate Peace, a one-act play by Sir Tom Stoppard on Zoom.""I'm fascinated by the format, which is a completely new kind of way of putting on a play where paradoxically you stay home and live theatre comes to you,"" Sir Tom said.The show tried to replicate something of the live experience, with audience members buying a ticket in advance and turning up at an allotted time - the performance deliberately wasn't put online to watch afterwards.It had professional crew, including video, lighting, costume and sound designers, and the actors (all at home, obviously) entered and exited their quarters of the screen as they would a stage. ""The cast were saying they were so nervous, like 'I really felt like I was standing in the wings,'"" says producer Matt Humphrey.""We want to show other people that this can be done and give confidence to other people that live theatre still has a place during lockdown."" And he believes such Zoom-style shows will still have a place when quarantine lifts.The Guardian's five-star review declared: ""If, for however long, this is live theatre's future, then it works triumphantly.""Another Zoom theatre triumph got the audience fully involved from their sofas.In a playful version of The Tempest from Northern Ireland-based theatre company Big Telly and Oxford's Creation Theatre, viewers were asked to help out by doing things like making storm sound effects and pretending to be a flock of birds. The most enthusiastic were spotlighted on screen for the rest of the audience to see.Another show, Operation Elsewhere, was originally ""an immersive theatre game"" played in the real world.  When the world locked down, it was hastily reworked for Zoom - also with lots of audience participation.""People turn all the lights off and get under blankets because we need cover of darkness,"" Big Telly artistic director Zoe Seaton explains. ""There was one point where a character says, 'If you've got war paint get it on now', and you see people rushing to the kitchen and getting ketchup and things.""End of Youtube post  by Big TellyVirtual backgrounds and green screens can create settings and effects that would be difficult and expensive in real life. ""I'm really enjoying it because it feels like a new box of tricks, a new way of telling stories,"" Seaton says.People have been tuning in from around the world and using the shows to have a shared night ""out"" with separated family members.""The joy of seeing your nephew and niece in Canada doing something in the same show that you're part of has just been amazing,"" Seaton says. ""We're interested in taking that further.""We work in rural communities in Ireland mostly, as well as Belfast and Derry, and suddenly our audience are in Brooklyn, and you think, oh gosh!""The key has been inviting the audience to bring the shows to life, Seaton adds. ""They have had that sense of community that theatre has, where you're all on the same journey. ""That's their main success. I think that's what people are missing in lockdown - that sense of community.""",18 May 2020,entertainment

Ruby Rose leaves Batwoman - and other stars who exited major roles,"The Australian actress Ruby Rose is to leave her role as comic book superhero Batwoman after just one series.Rose said it had been a ""very difficult decision"" not to return to the show, which is shown in the UK on E4.Batwoman, which began on the CW network last year, is the first superhero show to have an openly gay lead character.Its producers said they were ""firmly committed"" to the show's ""long-term"" future and would re-cast the role with another member of the LGBTQ community.Rose, who is herself gay, said she was ""truly grateful... to everyone who made season one a success"". The 34-year-old said she had ""the utmost respect"" for everyone involved and that the decision to leave had not been ""made lightly"".Rose faced a backlash on social media when she was cast as Batwoman, with some saying the role should have gone to a lesbian actress.The actress, who has called herself ""gender-fluid"" in interviews, later deleted her Twitter profile, though she remains active on Instagram.Last year Rose revealed she had suffered an injury while filming the series that had required her to undergo emergency surgery.The actress said she had ""herniated two discs doing stunts"" - but Deadline reported the injury was not the reason for her departure.Born in Melbourne in 1986, Rose played Stella Carlin in Orange is the New Black and has appeared in such films as Pitch Perfect 3 and The Meg.Yet she is far from the first actor to leave or be replaced in a major film or TV show.George Lazenby famously walked away from the role of James Bond after making just one appearance in the popular spy film series.The model turned actor later admitted he had been persuaded by his then-manager - the late Ronan O'Rahilly - to seek other opportunities.""I thought he knew what he was talking about so I listened to him,"" the Australian told an audience at the National Film Theatre last year.Lazenby's single outing as Bond, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was released in 1969 and is now a firm fan favourite.Christopher Eccleston was cast as The Doctor when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 - but he departed after a single series.The actor, who was replaced by David Tennant, later said he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture"" of the show.""My relationship with my three immediate superiors... broke down irreparably during the first block of filming and it never recovered,"" he elaborated in 2018.The actor, currently to be seen in The A Word on BBC One, also said he had been ""out of his comfort zone"" playing the sci-fi drama's time-travelling hero.Edward Norton was cast as Bruce Banner in 2008's The Incredible Hulk but did not reprise the role in Marvel Studios' subsequent comic-book blockbusters.Its president Kevin Feige later said the role had been recast out of a ""need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members"".Speaking last year, Norton called Feige's 2010 statement ""cheap"" and that his exit had been the result of differing views on how to depict the character.""Ultimately they weren't going for long, dark and serious,"" said Norton, who was replaced by Mark Ruffalo when The Hulk returned in 2012's Avengers Assemble.Terrence Howard, who played James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in 2008's Iron Man, is another actor to be replaced in Marvel's superhero film series.He later claimed he was offered less money than he had been promised to reprise the role, which Don Cheadle has played since 2010's Iron Man 2.Sharon Gless played Christine Cagney in Cagney and Lacey for seven years, winning two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for her pains.Yet she was not the first actress to play the part in the popular US TV series about two female police detectives solving crimes in New York City.Loretta Swit played Cagney in the original TV movie but was not able to continue in the role when the CBS show went to series.Meg Foster was then cast, only to be replaced after six episodes because CBS allegedly wanted someone ""more feminine"" in the role.Speaking in 2012, Gless praised her co-star Tyne Daly for ""welcoming me as if she had not had anybody before me"".""I know her heart was hurting because she loved her last Cagney,"" she revealed.When Men Behaving Badly first began in 1992, the two flatmates were played by Martin Clunes and Harry Enfield.According to Clunes, though, the show that ITV produced did not match Enfield's hopes for it.""His original vision was for it not to be like a usual sitcom,"" Clunes told The Guardian in 2013. ""Then we made the pilot and it shocked him.""You could see Harry wanted out,"" he continued. ""He was under contract, though, so had to do one series.""Neil Morrissey was subsequently cast as Clunes' flatmate in the show, which continued on ITV for another series before being picked up by the BBC.Jodie Foster earned her second best actress Oscar for playing Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs - one of five Academy Awards Jonathan Demme's film won in 1992.When the offer came to reprise her role in Hannibal, though, she turned it down - opening the door for Julianne Moore to appear with Anthony Hopkins in Ridley Scott's 2001 follow-up.""I stand to make more money doing that sequel than I've ever made in my life,"" Foster was quoted as saying in 1999. ""But who cares, if it betrays Clarice?""""The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie,"" she elaborated in 2005. ""So I get to say, in a nice, dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot.""Amusingly, however, Foster was enticed to reprise her FBI agent character in 2017 for a satirical sketch on Stephen Colbert's late-night US talk show.End of Youtube post  by The Late Show with Stephen ColbertYou may also like:",20 May 2020,entertainment
