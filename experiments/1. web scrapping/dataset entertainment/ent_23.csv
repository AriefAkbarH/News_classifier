The Salisbury Poisonings: TV drama revisits Novichok attack 'horror',"Scenes of streets in lockdown, health officials wearing PPE, dangerously contaminated surfaces and a battle with an invisible enemy are set to feature in a new TV drama from Sunday.But the events depicted in BBC One's The Salisbury Poisonings took place two years before the coronavirus pandemic began. The three-part series is based on the events of March 2018, when the Wiltshire cathedral city faced one of the biggest threats to UK public health in recent years.Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped and foaming at the mouth on a city centre bench, having been poisoned with the deadly nerve agent Novichok.The government would later conclude it was an assassination attempt by two agents of Russian intelligence service the GRU.It's an extraordinary story, which Salisbury is still recovering from. But the dramatisation isn't some kind of James Bond-style spy thriller. The Skripals are only seen briefly at the beginning of the first episode, and the Russian suspects are not shown at all. Instead, it focuses on the response of the local community and health officials.""We were drawn to the stories of the people who had to clean up this mess, rather than the people who made it,"" says Declan Lawn, who co-wrote the script with Adam Patterson.""It's about ordinary people who have to pick up the pieces. We thought that's where the drama was, where the emotion was. We didn't want to do the obvious thing, which would have probably been an espionage drama. ""But I hope that what we've done is show that there are people out there who take a bullet for us, they are a hidden network of people who keep this society together.""At the centre of the The Salisbury Poisonings is Tracy Daszkiewicz (played by Anne-Marie Duff), the director of public health for Wiltshire.She had been appointed just three months before the Skripals were poisoned, but had worked for Wiltshire Council for more than a decade.In reality, Daszkiewicz played an integral role of the response to the poisoning, but avoided media exposure - in part to not betray the trust of local residents.Together with the police, she used CCTV to work meticulously to find out who the Skripals might have come into contact with on the day they were poisoned, and took a cautious approach to protecting the public.""To us now, it seems perfectly logical,"" says Duff, referring to how common certain health measures have become since coronavirus. ""Of course we close our doors and windows and wear masks, but at the time, it seemed like she was being thoroughly extreme and overreacting.""But what's glorious about Tracy is her background. Her background is in social work, she's very grassroots, she comes at things from a tactile level. So she'll ask, 'What do we know to be true? What do we know if someone has food poisoning? What if the water source becomes contaminated?'""Both Skripals survived the attack, as did Det Sgt Nick Bailey, a police officer who was one of the first to respond to the attack.But a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the substance several weeks after the initial attack.On 30 June, Ms Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley became unwell at a house in Amesbury, eight miles from Salisbury, after spraying a bottle of perfume containing Novichok on her wrists.The perfume had been given to her as a gift from Rowley, who had found it in a charity shop bin. He said it had been disguised as a well-known perfume brand and was in sealed packaging.Actress MyAnna Buring, who plays Ms Sturgess, says the portrayal of her in the Salisbury Poisonings may surprise those who remember media coverage of her death in 2018.""A lot of us remember a lot of news outlets describing her as homeless and a drug addict, and in doing so sort of dismissed her death as inevitable because of her life choices,"" Buring recalls.""And that simply was not true. She was not homeless, she was not a drug addict, she was a woman who had experienced mental health issues, and knocks in life, which I think all of us can relate to. She did struggle with alcohol but she was working really hard to turn her life around. She had a loving family, partner, friends.""It can often take a long time for a TV drama or film to be made about a real life event, but The Salisbury Poisonings has been turned around relatively quickly. Indeed, the series was only completed in the last few months.Director Saul Dibb explains: ""We filmed our last sequence the week before lockdown [on 23 March], and after that we finished it remotely. It just had this creeping sense of resonance as coronavirus took over us.""The drama was filmed mainly in Newport, south Wales, plus Bristol and other parts of the south-west, rather than in Salisbury itself. Duff has said producers were ""very sensitive"" about where to recreate certain events.Nonetheless, there has been some criticism of the drama, including from DS Bailey's parents, who said in a letter to a local newspaper last year that the series was ""inappropriately premature"". DS Bailey himself, however, did not object, and has met the actor who plays him, Rafe Spall.Like ITV's recent drama Quiz, the BBC has decided to broadcast the three episodes on consecutive nights, rather than risk losing momentum (and audience interest) by making them weekly.As a drama it ""works as a narrative on a number of different levels"", says Dibb. ""It's partly a domestic drama, partly a thriller, and partly a very prescient virus horror, of this invisible enemy that can kill lots of people. ""So it was about finding ways to harness all of those things to be able to tell a story which I think all of us felt had the potential to be more than a straightforward docu-drama. ""And it's extraordinarily surreal, this weird thing happening in the middle of this small British cathedral city, that even if you were directly poisoned or not, everybody - it seemed to me - became contaminated by this poison."" The Salisbury Poisonings starts on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Sunday 14 June.",14 June 2020,entertainment
Little Britain: Matt Lucas and David Walliams 'very sorry' for blackface,"Matt Lucas and David Walliams have apologised for playing characters of different ethnic backgrounds in their sketch show Little Britain.The series used blackface make-up in some sketches. Earlier this week it was removed from BBC iPlayer, Netflix and BritBox after objections resurfaced.The pair said they ""regret that we played characters of other races"".""Once again we want to make it clear that it was wrong and we are very sorry,"" they said in their statements.Lucas and Walliams said they had both spoken publicly in recent years about the regret they felt about such scenes.In 2017, Lucas said: ""If I could go back and do Little Britain again, I wouldn't make those jokes about transvestites. I wouldn't play black characters.""Basically, I wouldn't make that show now. It would upset people. We made a more cruel kind of comedy than I'd do now.""Walliams has also said he would ""definitely do it differently"" in today's cultural landscape.Earlier this year, Lucas said the pair would ""love to bring it back in some way and at some point"", and suggested a Little Britain stage show could be one option.Walliams used black make-up and an afro wig to play the black woman Desiree DeVere, while Lucas used blackface to play Pastor Jesse King.Last Friday in the wake of anti-racism protests, Netflix took the show off its platform along with their other comedy, Come Fly With Me. The BBC and Britbox took Little Britain off on Monday. Both outlets said ""times have changed"" since it first aired.Little Britain first aired in 2003 and ran for four series until 2008.Come Fly With Me aired in 2010 and there were complaints then over its portrayal of racially stereotyped characters and the use of blackface.",14 June 2020,entertainment
The King of Staten Island: Will Gompertz reviews Judd Apatow's film ★★★★☆,"On the face of it The King of Staten Island tells a tale so familiar it's a cliché. A young man is struggling to come to terms with adult life. He smokes a lot of weed, hangs out with a crew of equally lost souls, and starts making some ill-advised life decisions. He's not an inherently bad lad: he loves his mum, he's nice to kids (mostly), and routinely disarms with his self-deprecating charms. You know this story, you know this person. If you're like me, it was you. Or, is you. Or, your brother. Or, one of your friends, or one of your children, or one of your friend's children, or one of your children's friends. He is the Everyman in the male coming-of-age saga: a troubled, confused, angry, depressed, fragile dude looking for some direction and purpose - not that he'd ever admit it. There's a journey to be taken and that's the basis of the movie/book/play/song etc. And so it is with The King of Staten Island, a 135-minute easy-paced film directed by Judd Apatow, now available on-demand. It is not genre-busting, or genre-defining, or genre-bending - it is a middle-of-the-road genre staple. Except for one thing…Pete Davidson. Pete Davidson is the movie's star. He isn't middle-of-the-road. He's speeding along the charisma super-highway, turning heads with what looks like an old banger act but is in fact a finely-tuned, custom-made performance that not only brings the film alive, but gives it a heart and a soul. Whatever way you look at it, The King of Staten Island is his film. Or put another way, Pete Davidson is The King of Staten Island.The comedian and Saturday Night Live regular plays the lead role, he gives the stand-out performance, he co-wrote the script, and he has an executive producer credit. He was even born in Staten Island and still lives there, for goodness sake. And that's not all.Davidson plays Scott Carlin, a drifting 24-year old wannabe tattoo artist who has yet to come to terms with the death of his firefighter father, killed in the line of duty when our pot-head protagonist was a boy. Scott's mental health is poor. He smokes too many joints, he lives with his mum, and he has chronic gut issues. It is a biography that reads very close to Davidson's own life story (his firefighter father, also called Scott, died trying to save others as a 9/11 first responder).  Not exactly a stretch for Davidson the actor, then. I imagine there weren't a lot of ""Hey, Judd, what's my motivation?"" type conversations between lead actor and director. But, maybe, playing a fictional role largely based on your own back story is far harder than taking on the role of a totally different character altogether. Pete Davidson is not Scott Carlin in the way that Larry David is a heightened version of himself in Curb Your Enthusiasm. And yet, anybody who knows Davidson's stand-up work will see similar traits: the low-status schtick, the poking fun but not being mean - or being mean and then apologising afterwards. The dry delivery, the ill-fitting clothes, the off-beat persona. These characteristics are all evident in Scott Carlin, too, but somehow Davidson manages to shape him in such a way that the fictional character becomes so vivid it obscures the identity of the man playing him. That's not an easy trick to pull off.Davidson does it with plenty of help from his friends. Fellow stand-up comic Bill Burr plays Ray Bishop, a straight-talking, shirt-tucked-in kinda guy, who provides a nicely weighted counter-point to Scott and his haphazard lifestyle. Ray has eyes for Margie (the excellent Marisa Tomei), the long-suffering mother of Scott and his preppy younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow). That's one love story. The other is between Scott and his girlfriend Kelsey, a young woman hell-bent on putting Staten Island on the hipster map. She is played by the British actress Bel Powley, who was one of the few good things about Apple TV's The Morning Show (buckle up, there's a second season on the way). She doesn't have many scenes, but those she is in are some of the best in the movie - there'll be an Oscar on her shelf one of these days.There is also a very welcome cameo-plus from Steve Buscemi as Papa the fire chief, and a short but memorable appearance by Machine Gun Kelly in the guise of a tattoo shop owner.Judd Apatow does a good job keeping all the moving parts in order, although the pace could be a bit slow for some. It wasn't a problem for me, it's not as if there's a whole load to do right now. What's more, you sense a looseness that allowed the actors room to explore and improvise, which gives the film an edge it might otherwise lack.  It also affords the viewer a chance to reflect while watching. And when you do, it becomes apparent The King of Staten Island is more than a run-of-the-mill genre movie. It is a brutally honest, first-person account of what can happen to a family when tragedy strikes. It's not hyperbolic or overly-dramatic. It's just sad and downbeat at times. It is not a new story, but it is well told.And Pete Davidson is always worth watching.  Recent reviews by Will Gompertz  Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter",13 June 2020,entertainment
Fawlty Towers: The Germans episode to be reinstated by UKTV,"A classic episode of the comedy Fawlty Towers will be reinstated to streaming service UKTV with a warning about ""offensive content and language"".A 1975 episode titled The Germans was taken off the BBC Studios-owned platform because of ""racial slurs"".In it, the Major character uses highly offensive language, and John Cleese's hotel owner Basil Fawlty declares ""don't mention the war"".UKTV had temporarily removed the episode while it carried out a review.The move had been criticised by Cleese who wrote on Twitter: ""I would have hoped that someone at the BBC would understand that there are two ways of making fun of human behaviour.""One is to attack it directly. The other is to have someone who is patently a figure of fun, speak up on behalf of that behaviour.""While the episode is best remembered for Fawlty's goose-stepping it also contains scenes showing the Major Gowen character using offensive language about the West Indies cricket team.According to reports, the Major's scenes had already started to be edited out by some broadcasters.As the Black Lives Matter movement has returned to prominence following the death of George Floyd, broadcasters and streaming services have reevaluated their content.UKTV also operates channels including Gold, and many of its channels and its digital player were taken over by the BBC's commercial arm BBC Studios last year.A UKTV statement said: ""We already offer guidance to viewers across some of our classic comedy titles, but we recognise that more contextual information can be required on our archive comedy, so we will be adding extra guidance and warnings to the front of programmes to highlight potentially offensive content and language.""We will reinstate Fawlty Towers once that extra guidance has been added, which we expect will be in the coming days.""We will continue to look at what content is on offer as we always have done.""The Germans is still available to view on Britbox, which is part-owned by the BBC, with a message saying it ""contains some offensive racial language of the time and upsetting scenes"". It is also on Netflix, carrying a warning about ""language, [and] discrimination"".In 2013, it was reported that Cleese agreed for the offending lines to be edited out when it was repeated on TV.This week, many channels and comedy figures have been making moves to reassess what is acceptable in today's society, following mass Black Lives Matter protests after the death of George Floyd.HBO Max temporarily removed Gone With The Wind because of its ""racial depictions"", and Little Britain was removed from the BBC iPlayer and Britbox because ""times have changed"".Netflix has also removed Little Britain plus David Walliams and Matt Lucas's Come Fly With Me, and The League of Gentlemen and The Mighty Boosh.Meanwhile, Ant and Dec apologised for impersonating ""people of colour"" on Saturday Night Takeaway, and requested ITV remove the 2003 and 2004 sketches from its catch-up service.Last week, comedian Leigh Francis issued an emotional apology for having dressed as black celebrities in the noughties impression show Bo' Selecta.",13 June 2020,entertainment
Drama school's former principal apologises for past racist remarks,"The ex-head of a drama school embroiled in a race row has apologised for saying the introduction of diversity quotas could lead to a lowering of standards.Prof Gavin Henderson said he would ""regret forever"" his ""racist"" comments.This week a group of young BAME actors spoke out about racial discrimination they faced at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London.The school said it was ""deeply sorry"" and has announced measures aimed at achieving ""real and meaningful change"".They include moves to ""de-colonise"" its curriculum and ""cultivate a workforce of more diverse academic staff"".The institution has also pledged to investigate ""every single complaint of racism received"".Prof Henderson made his comments at a 2018 event called Dear White Central.""We want to make this as accessible a school as possible but there are absolute standards we have to achieve,"" he later told The Stage.In a statement released on Friday, he said his comments had ""undermined"" Central's credibility and caused ""lasting pain and damage"".He said: ""I apologise unreservedly for the lived experiences of students of colour during my time as principal of Central. Our systems failed.""In a letter sent earlier this week, 240 former students said ""words and actions of open and overt racism"" had blighted their time at the school.Their complaints included teachers calling black students by their wrong names and a lack of diversity in the plays being studied.The group formed after being dismayed when the institution posted a message supporting the Black Lives Matter movement last week.Prof Henderson, who was due to retire at the end of term, has brought forward his retirement by three months.In their response, the school's current chiefs apologised ""for the lack of effective change and leadership"" and for not taking action sooner.""Transformational change is needed and will be enacted,"" they promised, adding: ""We know that the school has a long road to travel.""Founded in 1906, Central's many famous alumni include Riz Ahmed, Dame Judi Dench, Star Wars' Carrie Fisher and Sir Laurence Olivier.",12 June 2020,entertainment

""We were trying to find a way that we could get away with murder without it sounding completely filthy.""End of Youtube post  by JessieWareVEVOIt is certainly a departure from Ware's last album, Glasshouse, where she wrote about meeting and falling in love with her partner, Sam Burrows, a personal trainer, and her struggles as a new mother.Released in 2017, the record earned her a Brit nomination for best female, but sales were underwhelming and an appearance at the Coachella music festival went so badly that her mum advised her to quit music altogether.By that point, the pair had started a hugely successful podcast, Table Manners, in which they cook a meal for a celebrity guest, while giving them a grilling of their own.Listening to an episode feels like eavesdropping at a family dinner party: Jessie and Lennie bicker and tease and resurrect embarrassing memories, but their affection for each other shines through. ""We're quite a loud, emotional family,"" Ware concedes. ""There's no secrets, there's not that much politeness, we're quite dysfunctional but it works.""Fans have devoured the show's hilarious, zero-filter conversations with an appetite to match guest star Ed Sheeran, who ate ""four helpings of sausages"" during his appearance.Now in its 10th series, the podcast has been downloaded more than 80 million times (""the only number one I've ever got in my life,"" jokes Ware) with highlights including Sam Smith's worryingly accurate Gollum impersonation, and Aisling Bea explaining to Lennie the difference between ""doggy-style"" and ""dogging"".Ware, in particular, has a knack for drawing candid confessions from her guests.""People always confide in me very quickly,"" she says. ""I always seem to be that person that somebody's telling their life story to in the toilet at a party.""And I'm always quite up for it: I just kind of put my claws into other people and suck the life out of them.""The podcast has now spawned a cookbook and a live show - and the success gave Ware room to re-evaluate her musical career.She ditched the autobiographical, confessional lyrics of Glasshouse and went back to the cutting-edge club sounds of her debut... while embracing her inner horny sorceress.""This album was pure escapism: Let's fantasise, let's do everything faster and sexier and naughtier.""Pulse-quickening title track What's Your Pleasure is a breathless update of Donna Summer's Love To Love You Baby; while Save A Kiss sizzles with sensuality. ""You're always striking the match,"" she sighs, ""And I think I'm gonna burn now.""""It's fun playing the temptress, because that's so not me,"" Ware laughs. ""But I want my nightlife to to be like What's Your Pleasure. ""I'm longing for that: A bit of a night out and touching and speaking intimately to each other. Maybe meeting a stranger and not having to deal with the people you're living with for a night.""This is what's so funny. I've written this record that's total fantasy, because my nightlife is dealing with two kids between 2am and 5am, and them having a frickin' party but my husband and I just being like, 'Jesus Christ, go to sleep'.""End of Youtube post 2 by JessieWareVEVOBut the album isn't just about good times. The album closes with a stunning, baroque-pop symphony, Remember Where You Are, that laments the divisiveness of modern politics. ""The heart of the city is on fire,"" she observes, as a choir pleads: ""Can't we keep loving, on the edge of doubt?""The song was written in a moment of despondency last summer. ""Trump was in town, Boris had just got elected and it felt like a bit of an [expletive] show,"" says the singer, who's a staunch Labour supporter. ""It felt like us acknowledging the state of what's going on - and that a bit of intimacy and love can always work a treat.""The sound of the song was inspired by the spiritual optimism of 70s soul tracks Les Fleurs (by Minnie Ripperton) and State Of Independence (Donna Summer).""We were totally trying to do Les Fleurs,"" says Ware. ""We wanted it to feel like an overture. For it to be a group vocal but to be sung with drama.""I'm so proud of that song. I want it to be at the end of an episode of Handmaid's Tale. I think it's good enough.""End of Youtube post  by therotatingchinmenThe singer put her activism into practice last week, attending several of the Black Lives Matter protests in London, an experience she calls ""incredibly powerful and peaceful"".""There was a strong sense of solidarity - but also of young voices really commanding our attention and leading the chants. I thought that that was really inspiring. It was the youngest protest I've ever been to.""Ware later decided to push back the release of her album, after discovering its release date, 19 June, coincided with Freedom Day, which celebrates the freedom of enslaved people in the US.""It's an incredibly important day for black voices, and I don't want to distract from those voices or those experiences or stories in any way,"" she said in a video posted to her Facebook page.It's the sort of public stance she might have avoided in the past but, over the last three years, Ware says she's grown more at ease with being herself.""For so long I was so scared and nervous,"" she says. ""Like on the first album, I dressed up to hide myself. I'd have my hair done and my power suit, and it was all about trying to make me feel more confident. ""I even hid my 'big voice' on the first record because I didn't particularly want to show it off. But then I worked with [producer] Benny Blanco who was like, 'You've got a voice, sing out a bit more,' so I did a song like Say You Love Me. ""This time I'm going back to this hushed voice - but it's so much more controlled and decisive. And now, playing dress-up is just for sheer fun, because I guess I'm not so nervous anymore.""It was the podcast that allowed her to be herself. It might even have forced her hand. After all, it's difficult to convey a sense of mystique when you've been publicly berated by your mum for not showering.""I don't feel like I need to prove anything any more,"" says Ware. ""I feel very comfortable and confident.""You can see it for yourself in the playful TV performances she's staged during lockdown - dancing around her daughter's bedroom, illuminated by a set of disco lights she'd borrowed from Nick Grimshaw.""I wanted people to be sweaty in a club when they heard this record, and this is not how I imagined it coming out at all,"" she says.""But you know what? The whole premise is that it's fun and it's fabulous and it's fantasy. So why not have a disco ball and flashing lights and a smoke machine? ""Sod it. I made a bloody disco record, so let's do it!""  Jessie Ware's album, What's Your Pleasure, will be released on 26 June and she will tour the UK next April.",15 June 2020,entertainment
The Salisbury Poisonings: TV drama revisits Novichok attack 'horror',"Scenes of streets in lockdown, health officials wearing PPE, dangerously contaminated surfaces and a battle with an invisible enemy are set to feature in a new TV drama from Sunday.But the events depicted in BBC One's The Salisbury Poisonings took place two years before the coronavirus pandemic began. The three-part series is based on the events of March 2018, when the Wiltshire cathedral city faced one of the biggest threats to UK public health in recent years.Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped and foaming at the mouth on a city centre bench, having been poisoned with the deadly nerve agent Novichok.The government would later conclude it was an assassination attempt by two agents of Russian intelligence service the GRU.It's an extraordinary story, which Salisbury is still recovering from. But the dramatisation isn't some kind of James Bond-style spy thriller. The Skripals are only seen briefly at the beginning of the first episode, and the Russian suspects are not shown at all. Instead, it focuses on the response of the local community and health officials.""We were drawn to the stories of the people who had to clean up this mess, rather than the people who made it,"" says Declan Lawn, who co-wrote the script with Adam Patterson.""It's about ordinary people who have to pick up the pieces. We thought that's where the drama was, where the emotion was. We didn't want to do the obvious thing, which would have probably been an espionage drama. ""But I hope that what we've done is show that there are people out there who take a bullet for us, they are a hidden network of people who keep this society together.""At the centre of the The Salisbury Poisonings is Tracy Daszkiewicz (played by Anne-Marie Duff), the director of public health for Wiltshire.She had been appointed just three months before the Skripals were poisoned, but had worked for Wiltshire Council for more than a decade.In reality, Daszkiewicz played an integral role of the response to the poisoning, but avoided media exposure - in part to not betray the trust of local residents.Together with the police, she used CCTV to work meticulously to find out who the Skripals might have come into contact with on the day they were poisoned, and took a cautious approach to protecting the public.""To us now, it seems perfectly logical,"" says Duff, referring to how common certain health measures have become since coronavirus. ""Of course we close our doors and windows and wear masks, but at the time, it seemed like she was being thoroughly extreme and overreacting.""But what's glorious about Tracy is her background. Her background is in social work, she's very grassroots, she comes at things from a tactile level. So she'll ask, 'What do we know to be true? What do we know if someone has food poisoning? What if the water source becomes contaminated?'""Both Skripals survived the attack, as did Det Sgt Nick Bailey, a police officer who was one of the first to respond to the attack.But a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the substance several weeks after the initial attack.On 30 June, Ms Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley became unwell at a house in Amesbury, eight miles from Salisbury, after spraying a bottle of perfume containing Novichok on her wrists.The perfume had been given to her as a gift from Rowley, who had found it in a charity shop bin. He said it had been disguised as a well-known perfume brand and was in sealed packaging.Actress MyAnna Buring, who plays Ms Sturgess, says the portrayal of her in the Salisbury Poisonings may surprise those who remember media coverage of her death in 2018.""A lot of us remember a lot of news outlets describing her as homeless and a drug addict, and in doing so sort of dismissed her death as inevitable because of her life choices,"" Buring recalls.""And that simply was not true. She was not homeless, she was not a drug addict, she was a woman who had experienced mental health issues, and knocks in life, which I think all of us can relate to. She did struggle with alcohol but she was working really hard to turn her life around. She had a loving family, partner, friends.""It can often take a long time for a TV drama or film to be made about a real life event, but The Salisbury Poisonings has been turned around relatively quickly. Indeed, the series was only completed in the last few months.Director Saul Dibb explains: ""We filmed our last sequence the week before lockdown [on 23 March], and after that we finished it remotely. It just had this creeping sense of resonance as coronavirus took over us.""The drama was filmed mainly in Newport, south Wales, plus Bristol and other parts of the south-west, rather than in Salisbury itself. Duff has said producers were ""very sensitive"" about where to recreate certain events.Nonetheless, there has been some criticism of the drama, including from DS Bailey's parents, who said in a letter to a local newspaper last year that the series was ""inappropriately premature"". DS Bailey himself, however, did not object, and has met the actor who plays him, Rafe Spall.Like ITV's recent drama Quiz, the BBC has decided to broadcast the three episodes on consecutive nights, rather than risk losing momentum (and audience interest) by making them weekly.As a drama it ""works as a narrative on a number of different levels"", says Dibb. ""It's partly a domestic drama, partly a thriller, and partly a very prescient virus horror, of this invisible enemy that can kill lots of people. ""So it was about finding ways to harness all of those things to be able to tell a story which I think all of us felt had the potential to be more than a straightforward docu-drama. ""And it's extraordinarily surreal, this weird thing happening in the middle of this small British cathedral city, that even if you were directly poisoned or not, everybody - it seemed to me - became contaminated by this poison.""

Little Britain: Matt Lucas and David Walliams 'very sorry' for blackface,"Matt Lucas and David Walliams have apologised for playing characters of different ethnic backgrounds in their sketch show Little Britain.The series used blackface make-up in some sketches. Earlier this week it was removed from BBC iPlayer, Netflix and BritBox after objections resurfaced.The pair said they ""regret that we played characters of other races"".""Once again we want to make it clear that it was wrong and we are very sorry,"" they said in their statements.Lucas and Walliams said they had both spoken publicly in recent years about the regret they felt about such scenes.In 2017, Lucas said: ""If I could go back and do Little Britain again, I wouldn't make those jokes about transvestites. I wouldn't play black characters.""Basically, I wouldn't make that show now. It would upset people. We made a more cruel kind of comedy than I'd do now.""Walliams has also said he would ""definitely do it differently"" in today's cultural landscape.Earlier this year, Lucas said the pair would ""love to bring it back in some way and at some point"", and suggested a Little Britain stage show could be one option.Walliams used black make-up and an afro wig to play the black woman Desiree DeVere, while Lucas used blackface to play Pastor Jesse King.Last Friday in the wake of anti-racism protests, Netflix took the show off its platform along with their other comedy, Come Fly With Me. The BBC and Britbox took Little Britain off on Monday. Both outlets said ""times have changed"" since it first aired.Little Britain first aired in 2003 and ran for four series until 2008.Come Fly With Me aired in 2010 and there were complaints then over its portrayal of racially stereotyped characters and the use of blackface.",14 June 2020,entertainment
The King of Staten Island: Will Gompertz reviews Judd Apatow's film ★★★★☆,"On the face of it The King of Staten Island tells a tale so familiar it's a cliché. A young man is struggling to come to terms with adult life. He smokes a lot of weed, hangs out with a crew of equally lost souls, and starts making some ill-advised life decisions. He's not an inherently bad lad: he loves his mum, he's nice to kids (mostly), and routinely disarms with his self-deprecating charms. You know this story, you know this person. If you're like me, it was you. Or, is you. Or, your brother. Or, one of your friends, or one of your children, or one of your friend's children, or one of your children's friends. He is the Everyman in the male coming-of-age saga: a troubled, confused, angry, depressed, fragile dude looking for some direction and purpose - not that he'd ever admit it. There's a journey to be taken and that's the basis of the movie/book/play/song etc. And so it is with The King of Staten Island, a 135-minute easy-paced film directed by Judd Apatow, now available on-demand. It is not genre-busting, or genre-defining, or genre-bending - it is a middle-of-the-road genre staple. Except for one thing…Pete Davidson. Pete Davidson is the movie's star. He isn't middle-of-the-road. He's speeding along the charisma super-highway, turning heads with what looks like an old banger act but is in fact a finely-tuned, custom-made performance that not only brings the film alive, but gives it a heart and a soul. Whatever way you look at it, The King of Staten Island is his film. Or put another way, Pete Davidson is The King of Staten Island.The comedian and Saturday Night Live regular plays the lead role, he gives the stand-out performance, he co-wrote the script, and he has an executive producer credit. He was even born in Staten Island and still lives there, for goodness sake. And that's not all.Davidson plays Scott Carlin, a drifting 24-year old wannabe tattoo artist who has yet to come to terms with the death of his firefighter father, killed in the line of duty when our pot-head protagonist was a boy. Scott's mental health is poor. He smokes too many joints, he lives with his mum, and he has chronic gut issues. It is a biography that reads very close to Davidson's own life story (his firefighter father, also called Scott, died trying to save others as a 9/11 first responder).  Not exactly a stretch for Davidson the actor, then. I imagine there weren't a lot of ""Hey, Judd, what's my motivation?"" type conversations between lead actor and director. But, maybe, playing a fictional role largely based on your own back story is far harder than taking on the role of a totally different character altogether. Pete Davidson is not Scott Carlin in the way that Larry David is a heightened version of himself in Curb Your Enthusiasm. And yet, anybody who knows Davidson's stand-up work will see similar traits: the low-status schtick, the poking fun but not being mean - or being mean and then apologising afterwards. The dry delivery, the ill-fitting clothes, the off-beat persona. These characteristics are all evident in Scott Carlin, too, but somehow Davidson manages to shape him in such a way that the fictional character becomes so vivid it obscures the identity of the man playing him. That's not an easy trick to pull off.Davidson does it with plenty of help from his friends. Fellow stand-up comic Bill Burr plays Ray Bishop, a straight-talking, shirt-tucked-in kinda guy, who provides a nicely weighted counter-point to Scott and his haphazard lifestyle. Ray has eyes for Margie (the excellent Marisa Tomei), the long-suffering mother of Scott and his preppy younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow). That's one love story. The other is between Scott and his girlfriend Kelsey, a young woman hell-bent on putting Staten Island on the hipster map. She is played by the British actress Bel Powley, who was one of the few good things about Apple TV's The Morning Show (buckle up, there's a second season on the way). She doesn't have many scenes, but those she is in are some of the best in the movie - there'll be an Oscar on her shelf one of these days.There is also a very welcome cameo-plus from Steve Buscemi as Papa the fire chief, and a short but memorable appearance by Machine Gun Kelly in the guise of a tattoo shop owner.Judd Apatow does a good job keeping all the moving parts in order, although the pace could be a bit slow for some. It wasn't a problem for me, it's not as if there's a whole load to do right now. What's more, you sense a looseness that allowed the actors room to explore and improvise, which gives the film an edge it might otherwise lack.  It also affords the viewer a chance to reflect while watching. And when you do, it becomes apparent The King of Staten Island is more than a run-of-the-mill genre movie. It is a brutally honest, first-person account of what can happen to a family when tragedy strikes. It's not hyperbolic or overly-dramatic. It's just sad and downbeat at times. It is not a new story, but it is well told.And Pete Davidson is always worth watching.  Recent reviews by Will Gompertz  Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter",13 June 2020,entertainment
Fawlty Towers: The Germans episode to be reinstated by UKTV,"A classic episode of the comedy Fawlty Towers will be reinstated to streaming service UKTV with a warning about ""offensive content and language"".A 1975 episode titled The Germans was taken off the BBC Studios-owned platform because of ""racial slurs"".In it, the Major character uses highly offensive language, and John Cleese's hotel owner Basil Fawlty declares ""don't mention the war"".UKTV had temporarily removed the episode while it carried out a review.The move had been criticised by Cleese who wrote on Twitter: ""I would have hoped that someone at the BBC would understand that there are two ways of making fun of human behaviour.""One is to attack it directly. The other is to have someone who is patently a figure of fun, speak up on behalf of that behaviour.""While the episode is best remembered for Fawlty's goose-stepping it also contains scenes showing the Major Gowen character using offensive language about the West Indies cricket team.According to reports, the Major's scenes had already started to be edited out by some broadcasters.As the Black Lives Matter movement has returned to prominence following the death of George Floyd, broadcasters and streaming services have reevaluated their content.UKTV also operates channels including Gold, and many of its channels and its digital player were taken over by the BBC's commercial arm BBC Studios last year.A UKTV statement said: ""We already offer guidance to viewers across some of our classic comedy titles, but we recognise that more contextual information can be required on our archive comedy, so we will be adding extra guidance and warnings to the front of programmes to highlight potentially offensive content and language.""We will reinstate Fawlty Towers once that extra guidance has been added, which we expect will be in the coming days.""We will continue to look at what content is on offer as we always have done.""The Germans is still available to view on Britbox, which is part-owned by the BBC, with a message saying it ""contains some offensive racial language of the time and upsetting scenes"". It is also on Netflix, carrying a warning about ""language, [and] discrimination"".In 2013, it was reported that Cleese agreed for the offending lines to be edited out when it was repeated on TV.This week, many channels and comedy figures have been making moves to reassess what is acceptable in today's society, following mass Black Lives Matter protests after the death of George Floyd.HBO Max temporarily removed Gone With The Wind because of its ""racial depictions"", and Little Britain was removed from the BBC iPlayer and Britbox because ""times have changed"".Netflix has also removed Little Britain plus David Walliams and Matt Lucas's Come Fly With Me, and The League of Gentlemen and The Mighty Boosh.Meanwhile, Ant and Dec apologised for impersonating ""people of colour"" on Saturday Night Takeaway, and requested ITV remove the 2003 and 2004 sketches from its catch-up service.Last week, comedian Leigh Francis issued an emotional apology for having dressed as black celebrities in the noughties impression show Bo' Selecta.",13 June 2020,entertainment
Drama school's former principal apologises for past racist remarks,"The ex-head of a drama school embroiled in a race row has apologised for saying the introduction of diversity quotas could lead to a lowering of standards.Prof Gavin Henderson said he would ""regret forever"" his ""racist"" comments.This week a group of young BAME actors spoke out about racial discrimination they faced at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London.The school said it was ""deeply sorry"" and has announced measures aimed at achieving ""real and meaningful change"".They include moves to ""de-colonise"" its curriculum and ""cultivate a workforce of more diverse academic staff"".The institution has also pledged to investigate ""every single complaint of racism received"".Prof Henderson made his comments at a 2018 event called Dear White Central.""We want to make this as accessible a school as possible but there are absolute standards we have to achieve,"" he later told The Stage.In a statement released on Friday, he said his comments had ""undermined"" Central's credibility and caused ""lasting pain and damage"".He said: ""I apologise unreservedly for the lived experiences of students of colour during my time as principal of Central. Our systems failed.""In a letter sent earlier this week, 240 former students said ""words and actions of open and overt racism"" had blighted their time at the school.Their complaints included teachers calling black students by their wrong names and a lack of diversity in the plays being studied.The group formed after being dismayed when the institution posted a message supporting the Black Lives Matter movement last week.Prof Henderson, who was due to retire at the end of term, has brought forward his retirement by three months.In their response, the school's current chiefs apologised ""for the lack of effective change and leadership"" and for not taking action sooner.""Transformational change is needed and will be enacted,"" they promised, adding: ""We know that the school has a long road to travel.""Founded in 1906, Central's many famous alumni include Riz Ahmed, Dame Judi Dench, Star Wars' Carrie Fisher and Sir Laurence Olivier.",12 June 2020,entertainment

He's speeding along the charisma super-highway, turning heads with what looks like an old banger act but is in fact a finely-tuned, custom-made performance that not only brings the film alive, but gives it a heart and a soul. Whatever way you look at it, The King of Staten Island is his film. Or put another way, Pete Davidson is The King of Staten Island.The comedian and Saturday Night Live regular plays the lead role, he gives the stand-out performance, he co-wrote the script, and he has an executive producer credit. He was even born in Staten Island and still lives there, for goodness sake. And that's not all.Davidson plays Scott Carlin, a drifting 24-year old wannabe tattoo artist who has yet to come to terms with the death of his firefighter father, killed in the line of duty when our pot-head protagonist was a boy. Scott's mental health is poor. He smokes too many joints, he lives with his mum, and he has chronic gut issues. It is a biography that reads very close to Davidson's own life story (his firefighter father, also called Scott, died trying to save others as a 9/11 first responder).  Not exactly a stretch for Davidson the actor, then. I imagine there weren't a lot of ""Hey, Judd, what's my motivation?"" type conversations between lead actor and director. But, maybe, playing a fictional role largely based on your own back story is far harder than taking on the role of a totally different character altogether. Pete Davidson is not Scott Carlin in the way that Larry David is a heightened version of himself in Curb Your Enthusiasm. And yet, anybody who knows Davidson's stand-up work will see similar traits: the low-status schtick, the poking fun but not being mean - or being mean and then apologising afterwards. The dry delivery, the ill-fitting clothes, the off-beat persona. These characteristics are all evident in Scott Carlin, too, but somehow Davidson manages to shape him in such a way that the fictional character becomes so vivid it obscures the identity of the man playing him. That's not an easy trick to pull off.Davidson does it with plenty of help from his friends. Fellow stand-up comic Bill Burr plays Ray Bishop, a straight-talking, shirt-tucked-in kinda guy, who provides a nicely weighted counter-point to Scott and his haphazard lifestyle. Ray has eyes for Margie (the excellent Marisa Tomei), the long-suffering mother of Scott and his preppy younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow). That's one love story. The other is between Scott and his girlfriend Kelsey, a young woman hell-bent on putting Staten Island on the hipster map. She is played by the British actress Bel Powley, who was one of the few good things about Apple TV's The Morning Show (buckle up, there's a second season on the way). She doesn't have many scenes, but those she is in are some of the best in the movie - there'll be an Oscar on her shelf one of these days.There is also a very welcome cameo-plus from Steve Buscemi as Papa the fire chief, and a short but memorable appearance by Machine Gun Kelly in the guise of a tattoo shop owner.Judd Apatow does a good job keeping all the moving parts in order, although the pace could be a bit slow for some. It wasn't a problem for me, it's not as if there's a whole load to do right now. What's more, you sense a looseness that allowed the actors room to explore and improvise, which gives the film an edge it might otherwise lack.  It also affords the viewer a chance to reflect while watching. And when you do, it becomes apparent The King of Staten Island is more than a run-of-the-mill genre movie. It is a brutally honest, first-person account of what can happen to a family when tragedy strikes. It's not hyperbolic or overly-dramatic. It's just sad and downbeat at times. It is not a new story, but it is well told.And Pete Davidson is always worth watching.  Recent reviews by Will Gompertz  Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter",13 June 2020,entertainment
Fawlty Towers: The Germans episode to be reinstated by UKTV,"A classic episode of the comedy Fawlty Towers will be reinstated to streaming service UKTV with a warning about ""offensive content and language"".A 1975 episode titled The Germans was taken off the BBC Studios-owned platform because of ""racial slurs"".In it, the Major character uses highly offensive language, and John Cleese's hotel owner Basil Fawlty declares ""don't mention the war"".UKTV had temporarily removed the episode while it carried out a review.The move had been criticised by Cleese who wrote on Twitter: ""I would have hoped that someone at the BBC would understand that there are two ways of making fun of human behaviour.""One is to attack it directly. The other is to have someone who is patently a figure of fun, speak up on behalf of that behaviour.""While the episode is best remembered for Fawlty's goose-stepping it also contains scenes showing the Major Gowen character using offensive language about the West Indies cricket team.According to reports, the Major's scenes had already started to be edited out by some broadcasters.As the Black Lives Matter movement has returned to prominence following the death of George Floyd, broadcasters and streaming services have reevaluated their content.UKTV also operates channels including Gold, and many of its channels and its digital player were taken over by the BBC's commercial arm BBC Studios last year.A UKTV statement said: ""We already offer guidance to viewers across some of our classic comedy titles, but we recognise that more contextual information can be required on our archive comedy, so we will be adding extra guidance and warnings to the front of programmes to highlight potentially offensive content and language.""We will reinstate Fawlty Towers once that extra guidance has been added, which we expect will be in the coming days.""We will continue to look at what content is on offer as we always have done.""The Germans is still available to view on Britbox, which is part-owned by the BBC, with a message saying it ""contains some offensive racial language of the time and upsetting scenes"". It is also on Netflix, carrying a warning about ""language, [and] discrimination"".In 2013, it was reported that Cleese agreed for the offending lines to be edited out when it was repeated on TV.This week, many channels and comedy figures have been making moves to reassess what is acceptable in today's society, following mass Black Lives Matter protests after the death of George Floyd.HBO Max temporarily removed Gone With The Wind because of its ""racial depictions"", and Little Britain was removed from the BBC iPlayer and Britbox because ""times have changed"".Netflix has also removed Little Britain plus David Walliams and Matt Lucas's Come Fly With Me, and The League of Gentlemen and The Mighty Boosh.Meanwhile, Ant and Dec apologised for impersonating ""people of colour"" on Saturday Night Takeaway, and requested ITV remove the 2003 and 2004 sketches from its catch-up service.Last week, comedian Leigh Francis issued an emotional apology for having dressed as black celebrities in the noughties impression show Bo' Selecta.",13 June 2020,entertainment
Drama school's former principal apologises for past racist remarks,"The ex-head of a drama school embroiled in a race row has apologised for saying the introduction of diversity quotas could lead to a lowering of standards.Prof Gavin Henderson said he would ""regret forever"" his ""racist"" comments.This week a group of young BAME actors spoke out about racial discrimination they faced at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London.The school said it was ""deeply sorry"" and has announced measures aimed at achieving ""real and meaningful change"".They include moves to ""de-colonise"" its curriculum and ""cultivate a workforce of more diverse academic staff"".The institution has also pledged to investigate ""every single complaint of racism received"".Prof Henderson made his comments at a 2018 event called Dear White Central.""We want to make this as accessible a school as possible but there are absolute standards we have to achieve,"" he later told The Stage.In a statement released on Friday, he said his comments had ""undermined"" Central's credibility and caused ""lasting pain and damage"".He said: ""I apologise unreservedly for the lived experiences of students of colour during my time as principal of Central. Our systems failed.""In a letter sent earlier this week, 240 former students said ""words and actions of open and overt racism"" had blighted their time at the school.Their complaints included teachers calling black students by their wrong names and a lack of diversity in the plays being studied.The group formed after being dismayed when the institution posted a message supporting the Black Lives Matter movement last week.Prof Henderson, who was due to retire at the end of term, has brought forward his retirement by three months.In their response, the school's current chiefs apologised ""for the lack of effective change and leadership"" and for not taking action sooner.""Transformational change is needed and will be enacted,"" they promised, adding: ""We know that the school has a long road to travel.""Founded in 1906, Central's many famous alumni include Riz Ahmed, Dame Judi Dench, Star Wars' Carrie Fisher and Sir Laurence Olivier.",12 June 2020,entertainment
Why saving the (print) Evening Standard will be tough,"The Evening Standard is in big trouble and Emily Sheffield might be the last editor of its print edition. That's not the welcome most editors dream about, of course. Much of her tenure is certain to be a nightmare - often for reasons far beyond her control. Simply to keep the print edition going while producing high-quality journalism would count as a victory. She replaces her friend George Osborne, who will move to the much less hands-on role of editor-in-chief. The political connection - Sheffield is the sister-in-law of David Cameron - has led to immediate accusations of nepotism, and British media being a revolving door. Indeed, the connections of Sheffield, Osborne and Evgeny Lebedev - the main owner of the Evening Standard, in partnership with the Saudi Research and Marketing Group, which is ultimately controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - will need to be fully deployed if the print title is to be saved. (Full disclosure: I worked for Lebedev for six years).On Twitter, Sheffield said: ""The newspaper remains a core element to this outstanding legacy news organisation. It has survived this crisis and it will survive many more"". As editor she has to say that, and clearly she and the paper's excellent staff will do their utmost to keep it in print; but she takes over a business whose current financial condition makes the word ""crisis"" seem like a euphemism.The Standard, as I have written before, was uniquely exposed when this pandemic came along.It is very heavily reliant on income from its print edition, and has an under-developed digital operation, which Sheffield is charged with boosting.As a free title, the income for its print edition doesn't come from readers paying a cover price. It comes from advertising. Advertising has been decimated in recent months, partly because marketing spend is one of the first things to go in a downturn - and this is a mega downturn; and partly because brands don't want to be seen next to stories about a virus or people in care homes dying.The Standard is also very heavily reliant on footfall: thousands of commuters using stations and stalls to pick up the paper. That's gone.Finally, unlike Metro, which is part of the Daily Mail group, the Standard is in a small company, along with The Independent (where I was editor until March 2016) and London Live.This is a huge exposure. Some kind of subsidy might be necessary to keep the paper going. The tolerance of the current owners for the current losses is not sustainable. Where might such a subsidy come from?Right now, many local papers in the UK are becoming dependent on Californian tech giants for direct grants. Might the Standard create a new partnership with one such firm? That's tricky, given they are meant to be politically neutral.What about central government? Journalists feel instinctively queasy about taking money from governments they are meant to be holding to account. But government subsidy takes many forms. The furlough scheme is one such. Are there others?Editors want to edit. Editing is an exercise in selection: what stories, pictures, campaigns, headlines, and so on. But the Standard's model, which is not driven by cover price revenue, makes the editor position much, much more commercial than most. And that's before you throw a vulnerable business model and a global pandemic in. While Sheffield's appointment will inevitably garner more interest, the Standard recently appointed Charles Yardley of Forbes as its CEO. He, ultimately, is responsible for the bottom line. The hope for Sheffield, who worked for the Standard under Max Hastings and was deputy editor of Vogue, is that she gets the freedom and the chance to do the fun bit of editing while trying, with Yardley, Osborne and Lebedev, to turn the business around. For the title's staff, who have endured huge uncertainty and anxiety in recent months, a new boss should provide an energising effect. They know better than most that saving this part of London culture will be a long and painful haul.If you're interested in issues such as these, please follow me on Twitter or Facebook; and also please subscribe to The Media Show podcast from Radio 4.

King of Staten Island: 'There's comedy in the most difficult situations',"Filmmaker Judd Apatow has never been afraid to poke fun at serious subjects.In Knocked-Up he found the humour in an unwanted pregnancy from a one-night stand. In This is 40 he made us laugh about a couple going through a midlife crisis. And in 40-year-old Virgin he addressed... well, you know.For his latest project, The King of Staten Island, the director has joined forces with US comedy star Pete Davidson to tell the tale of the effects of the latter's own personal 9/11 tragedy.Aged seven, Davidson lost his father Scott, who died while working as a fire fighter helping to deal with the aftermath of the plane attacks on New York City in 2001. His dad was one of 2,977 people to lose their lives.""I always think that there's comedy in the most difficult situations,"" says Apatow, across a three-way virtual film junket.""That's why we like Dr Strangelove [Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sellers' dark comedy about nuclear war]. You can't have a more difficult situation than that. So that's the lens that I've always seen everything through.""I think as a kid, I felt a lot of hostility, I didn't feel like the world was fair. But I loved comedy films and comedians and I loved that they mocked how the world worked, and they helped me try to figure it out.""So I don't think anything is off limits, if your heart is in the right place you really can explore anything.""In the film, Davidson plays a ""75% true"" version of himself - a directionless grief-stricken 20-something stoner named Scott, who has behavioural issues, and lives with his mum and sister in the least fashionable of the five boroughs.He agrees it's all a rich vein of material.""I had similar experiences growing up as Judd, where I didn't think the world was fair and I had people like Adam Sandler and Jim Carey and Eddie Murphy and Bill Burr to point those things out to me and make it humorous,"" he says.Burr, as it happens, was able to help out Davidson directly, by playing the new love interest for Scott's widowed mother Margie; played by Marisa Tomei. As if having a new man in the house isn't problematic enough, Burr's character Ray just happens to be another fireman, and of course, comedy ensues.What initially began as ""90 pages of toilet humour,"" written by Davidson and his writing buddy Dave Cyrus, was, with Apatow's help, turned into a ""beautiful script"", full of ""emotion and range"".As well as being a ""love letter"" to his mum, Davidson, who also has an executive producer credit, hopes the feature will allow him to draw a line under many of the mental health issues that have plagued him, very publicly, for years.In December 2018, the police checked in on the at-times controversial SNL breakout stand-up star after he alarmed fans by posting on social media that he didn't ""want to be on this earth anymore"", not long after his high-profile breakup from ex-fiance Ariana Grande.""I had a lot of prior issues and a lot of stuff that I was dealing with personally that I wanted to bring to the forefront so that I could not only make a movie but also just grow as a person,"" says Davidson, who has borderline personality disorder, as well as Crohn's Disease.""What I wanted to do was maybe after we did this I could put that part of my life behind me and, not forget it, but move forward and have a new outlook on life.""Apatow believes the lead character, who daydreams about one day running a tattoo restaurant, is a fair reflection of what Pete's life might be like now if he hadn't found his comedy calling.The pair first worked together on another Apatow film - 2015's Trainwreck, and he describes Davidson as ""a funny, great, fascinating person"".That particular film gave another comic actor and writer, Amy Schumer, her big movie break, and other stars including Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and Kristen Wiig have all benefitted similarly from his direction early on.Now, with no cinematic release, due to the Covid-19 virus shutting theatres, and against the backdrop of mass Black Lives Matter protests, following the death of George Floyd, Davidson admits it's ""an odd time to put something out"".""It's nice to put something positive into the world, so I hope people enjoy it,"" he says.Making movies, Apatow stresses, is ""one of the hardest professions to make safe"", as they are ""all about being close to each other, touching each other, and being in very small spaces"".The director also hopes the protests, for people who ""were ignored for a very long time"" ultimately ""lead to meaningful change,"" and he urges people to vote for it in the US elections in November.""I just hope that people are kinder to each other in the future,"" adds Davidson.The thing they both miss most about the old pre-coronavirus world is the ability to simply hang out with friends at comedy clubs, where Apatow also began his career, as a stand-up. The 52-year-old jokes they'll both mark their film's online release by simultaneously pressing play on iPads from their own respective beds!The King of Staten Island is a film about trauma, loss, and the healing qualities of opening your heart again to love and laughter.What might Davidson's dad have made of it?""I think if my dad was around he would get a kick out of it,"" says the leading man. ""He would be like, 'holy crap, dude, that's crazy!'""My dad was a huge comedy fan, so I think he would just be thrilled"".As well as being there in spirit, the real Scott is made flesh on-screen not only by his son, but also by his own father Stephen, who makes a scene-stealing cameo as Grandpa. Apatow says: ""The truth is Pete, we never talked about it... your grandfather actually would get called, you can see him as a regular on Seinfeld. He actually could have been that guy"".""Oh yeah, he'll get some work out of this,"" nods his rather more famous grandson. For now, at least.The King of Staten Island is out now on various platforms",12 June 2020,entertainment
"How Jessie Ware's podcast made her music 'faster, sexier, naughtier'","""I got called 'the sorceress of horny' the other day,"" says Jessie Ware, brimming with glee. ""They said I would have been burned at the stake. It's the best quote I've ever had in my life.""The singer, who shot to fame in 2012 with her Mercury-nominated debut album, is quoting a not-entirely-inaccurate review of her latest single, Ooh La La.An irresistible slice of 80s disco-funk, its every line is a come-on, propelled by an impatient hopscotch bass line. ""It's full of innuendo,"" she laughs. ""We were trying to find a way that we could get away with murder without it sounding completely filthy.""End of Youtube post  by JessieWareVEVOIt is certainly a departure from Ware's last album, Glasshouse, where she wrote about meeting and falling in love with her partner, Sam Burrows, a personal trainer, and her struggles as a new mother.Released in 2017, the record earned her a Brit nomination for best female, but sales were underwhelming and an appearance at the Coachella music festival went so badly that her mum advised her to quit music altogether.By that point, the pair had started a hugely successful podcast, Table Manners, in which they cook a meal for a celebrity guest, while giving them a grilling of their own.Listening to an episode feels like eavesdropping at a family dinner party: Jessie and Lennie bicker and tease and resurrect embarrassing memories, but their affection for each other shines through. ""We're quite a loud, emotional family,"" Ware concedes. ""There's no secrets, there's not that much politeness, we're quite dysfunctional but it works.""Fans have devoured the show's hilarious, zero-filter conversations with an appetite to match guest star Ed Sheeran, who ate ""four helpings of sausages"" during his appearance.Now in its 10th series, the podcast has been downloaded more than 80 million times (""the only number one I've ever got in my life,"" jokes Ware) with highlights including Sam Smith's worryingly accurate Gollum impersonation, and Aisling Bea explaining to Lennie the difference between ""doggy-style"" and ""dogging"".Ware, in particular, has a knack for drawing candid confessions from her guests.""People always confide in me very quickly,"" she says. ""I always seem to be that person that somebody's telling their life story to in the toilet at a party.""And I'm always quite up for it: I just kind of put my claws into other people and suck the life out of them.""The podcast has now spawned a cookbook and a live show - and the success gave Ware room to re-evaluate her musical career.She ditched the autobiographical, confessional lyrics of Glasshouse and went back to the cutting-edge club sounds of her debut... while embracing her inner horny sorceress.""This album was pure escapism: Let's fantasise, let's do everything faster and sexier and naughtier.""Pulse-quickening title track What's Your Pleasure is a breathless update of Donna Summer's Love To Love You Baby; while Save A Kiss sizzles with sensuality. ""You're always striking the match,"" she sighs, ""And I think I'm gonna burn now.""""It's fun playing the temptress, because that's so not me,"" Ware laughs. ""But I want my nightlife to to be like What's Your Pleasure. ""I'm longing for that: A bit of a night out and touching and speaking intimately to each other. Maybe meeting a stranger and not having to deal with the people you're living with for a night.""This is what's so funny. I've written this record that's total fantasy, because my nightlife is dealing with two kids between 2am and 5am, and them having a frickin' party but my husband and I just being like, 'Jesus Christ, go to sleep'.""End of Youtube post 2 by JessieWareVEVOBut the album isn't just about good times. The album closes with a stunning, baroque-pop symphony, Remember Where You Are, that laments the divisiveness of modern politics. ""The heart of the city is on fire,"" she observes, as a choir pleads: ""Can't we keep loving, on the edge of doubt?""The song was written in a moment of despondency last summer. ""Trump was in town, Boris had just got elected and it felt like a bit of an [expletive] show,"" says the singer, who's a staunch Labour supporter. ""It felt like us acknowledging the state of what's going on - and that a bit of intimacy and love can always work a treat.""The sound of the song was inspired by the spiritual optimism of 70s soul tracks Les Fleurs (by Minnie Ripperton) and State Of Independence (Donna Summer).""We were totally trying to do Les Fleurs,"" says Ware. ""We wanted it to feel like an overture. For it to be a group vocal but to be sung with drama.""I'm so proud of that song. I want it to be at the end of an episode of Handmaid's Tale. I think it's good enough.""End of Youtube post  by therotatingchinmenThe singer put her activism into practice last week, attending several of the Black Lives Matter protests in London, an experience she calls ""incredibly powerful and peaceful"".""There was a strong sense of solidarity - but also of young voices really commanding our attention and leading the chants. I thought that that was really inspiring. It was the youngest protest I've ever been to.""Ware later decided to push back the release of her album, after discovering its release date, 19 June, coincided with Freedom Day, which celebrates the freedom of enslaved people in the US.""It's an incredibly important day for black voices, and I don't want to distract from those voices or those experiences or stories in any way,"" she said in a video posted to her Facebook page.It's the sort of public stance she might have avoided in the past but, over the last three years, Ware says she's grown more at ease with being herself.""For so long I was so scared and nervous,"" she says. ""Like on the first album, I dressed up to hide myself. I'd have my hair done and my power suit, and it was all about trying to make me feel more confident. ""I even hid my 'big voice' on the first record because I didn't particularly want to show it off. But then I worked with [producer] Benny Blanco who was like, 'You've got a voice, sing out a bit more,' so I did a song like Say You Love Me. ""This time I'm going back to this hushed voice - but it's so much more controlled and decisive. And now, playing dress-up is just for sheer fun, because I guess I'm not so nervous anymore.""It was the podcast that allowed her to be herself. It might even have forced her hand. After all, it's difficult to convey a sense of mystique when you've been publicly berated by your mum for not showering.""I don't feel like I need to prove anything any more,"" says Ware. ""I feel very comfortable and confident.""You can see it for yourself in the playful TV performances she's staged during lockdown - dancing around her daughter's bedroom, illuminated by a set of disco lights she'd borrowed from Nick Grimshaw.""I wanted people to be sweaty in a club when they heard this record, and this is not how I imagined it coming out at all,"" she says.""But you know what? The whole premise is that it's fun and it's fabulous and it's fantasy. So why not have a disco ball and flashing lights and a smoke machine? ""Sod it. I made a bloody disco record, so let's do it!""  Jessie Ware's album, What's Your Pleasure, will be released on 26 June and she will tour the UK next April.",15 June 2020,entertainment
Little Britain: Matt Lucas and David Walliams 'very sorry' for blackface,"Matt Lucas and David Walliams have apologised for playing characters of different ethnic backgrounds in their sketch show Little Britain.The series used blackface make-up in some sketches. Earlier this week it was removed from BBC iPlayer, Netflix and BritBox after objections resurfaced.The pair said they ""regret that we played characters of other races"".""Once again we want to make it clear that it was wrong and we are very sorry,"" they said in their statements.Lucas and Walliams said they had both spoken publicly in recent years about the regret they felt about such scenes.In 2017, Lucas said: ""If I could go back and do Little Britain again, I wouldn't make those jokes about transvestites. I wouldn't play black characters.""Basically, I wouldn't make that show now. It would upset people. We made a more cruel kind of comedy than I'd do now.""Walliams has also said he would ""definitely do it differently"" in today's cultural landscape.Earlier this year, Lucas said the pair would ""love to bring it back in some way and at some point"", and suggested a Little Britain stage show could be one option.Walliams used black make-up and an afro wig to play the black woman Desiree DeVere, while Lucas used blackface to play Pastor Jesse King.Last Friday in the wake of anti-racism protests, Netflix took the show off its platform along with their other comedy, Come Fly With Me. The BBC and Britbox took Little Britain off on Monday. Both outlets said ""times have changed"" since it first aired.Little Britain first aired in 2003 and ran for four series until 2008.Come Fly With Me aired in 2010 and there were complaints then over its portrayal of racially stereotyped characters and the use of blackface.",14 June 2020,entertainment
The Salisbury Poisonings: TV drama revisits Novichok attack 'horror',"Scenes of streets in lockdown, health officials wearing PPE, dangerously contaminated surfaces and a battle with an invisible enemy are set to feature in a new TV drama from Sunday.But the events depicted in BBC One's The Salisbury Poisonings took place two years before the coronavirus pandemic began. The three-part series is based on the events of March 2018, when the Wiltshire cathedral city faced one of the biggest threats to UK public health in recent years.Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped and foaming at the mouth on a city centre bench, having been poisoned with the deadly nerve agent Novichok.The government would later conclude it was an assassination attempt by two agents of Russian intelligence service the GRU.It's an extraordinary story, which Salisbury is still recovering from. But the dramatisation isn't some kind of James Bond-style spy thriller. The Skripals are only seen briefly at the beginning of the first episode, and the Russian suspects are not shown at all. Instead, it focuses on the response of the local community and health officials.""We were drawn to the stories of the people who had to clean up this mess, rather than the people who made it,"" says Declan Lawn, who co-wrote the script with Adam Patterson.""It's about ordinary people who have to pick up the pieces. We thought that's where the drama was, where the emotion was. We didn't want to do the obvious thing, which would have probably been an espionage drama. ""But I hope that what we've done is show that there are people out there who take a bullet for us, they are a hidden network of people who keep this society together.""At the centre of the The Salisbury Poisonings is Tracy Daszkiewicz (played by Anne-Marie Duff), the director of public health for Wiltshire.She had been appointed just three months before the Skripals were poisoned, but had worked for Wiltshire Council for more than a decade.In reality, Daszkiewicz played an integral role of the response to the poisoning, but avoided media exposure - in part to not betray the trust of local residents.Together with the police, she used CCTV to work meticulously to find out who the Skripals might have come into contact with on the day they were poisoned, and took a cautious approach to protecting the public.""To us now, it seems perfectly logical,"" says Duff, referring to how common certain health measures have become since coronavirus. ""Of course we close our doors and windows and wear masks, but at the time, it seemed like she was being thoroughly extreme and overreacting.""But what's glorious about Tracy is her background. Her background is in social work, she's very grassroots, she comes at things from a tactile level. So she'll ask, 'What do we know to be true? What do we know if someone has food poisoning? What if the water source becomes contaminated?'""Both Skripals survived the attack, as did Det Sgt Nick Bailey, a police officer who was one of the first to respond to the attack.But a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the substance several weeks after the initial attack.On 30 June, Ms Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley became unwell at a house in Amesbury, eight miles from Salisbury, after spraying a bottle of perfume containing Novichok on her wrists.The perfume had been given to her as a gift from Rowley, who had found it in a charity shop bin. He said it had been disguised as a well-known perfume brand and was in sealed packaging.Actress MyAnna Buring, who plays Ms Sturgess, says the portrayal of her in the Salisbury Poisonings may surprise those who remember media coverage of her death in 2018.""A lot of us remember a lot of news outlets describing her as homeless and a drug addict, and in doing so sort of dismissed her death as inevitable because of her life choices,"" Buring recalls.""And that simply was not true. She was not homeless, she was not a drug addict, she was a woman who had experienced mental health issues, and knocks in life, which I think all of us can relate to. She did struggle with alcohol but she was working really hard to turn her life around. She had a loving family, partner, friends.""It can often take a long time for a TV drama or film to be made about a real life event, but The Salisbury Poisonings has been turned around relatively quickly. Indeed, the series was only completed in the last few months.Director Saul Dibb explains: ""We filmed our last sequence the week before lockdown [on 23 March], and after that we finished it remotely. It just had this creeping sense of resonance as coronavirus took over us.""The drama was filmed mainly in Newport, south Wales, plus Bristol and other parts of the south-west, rather than in Salisbury itself. Duff has said producers were ""very sensitive"" about where to recreate certain events.Nonetheless, there has been some criticism of the drama, including from DS Bailey's parents, who said in a letter to a local newspaper last year that the series was ""inappropriately premature"". DS Bailey himself, however, did not object, and has met the actor who plays him, Rafe Spall.Like ITV's recent drama Quiz, the BBC has decided to broadcast the three episodes on consecutive nights, rather than risk losing momentum (and audience interest) by making them weekly.As a drama it ""works as a narrative on a number of different levels"", says Dibb. ""It's partly a domestic drama, partly a thriller, and partly a very prescient virus horror, of this invisible enemy that can kill lots of people. ""So it was about finding ways to harness all of those things to be able to tell a story which I think all of us felt had the potential to be more than a straightforward docu-drama. ""And it's extraordinarily surreal, this weird thing happening in the middle of this small British cathedral city, that even if you were directly poisoned or not, everybody - it seemed to me - became contaminated by this poison."" The Salisbury Poisonings starts on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Sunday 14 June.",14 June 2020,entertainment
