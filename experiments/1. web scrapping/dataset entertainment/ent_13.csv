As I worked to finish the book, I started reading chapters nightly to the family again.""This was one of the most extraordinary experiences of my writing life, as The Ickabog's first two readers told me what they remember from when they were tiny, and demanded the reinstatement of bits they'd particularly liked (I obeyed).""Opening the box was like opening a time capsule.

Doja Cat denies 'stripping for white supremacists' and using racist insults,"Pop star Doja Cat has denied taking part in racist conversations online, and apologised for a song that appeared to mock victims of police brutality.The star took to Instagram to address several accusations, including the suggestion she had stripped for white supremacists in a video chatroom.While she called that allegation ""100% incorrect"", the star admitted to ""dumb-ass behaviour"" in her past.""I'm sorry if I hurt you or made you feel in any way upset,"" she told fans.The singer/rapper, whose real name is Amalaratna Zandile Dlamini, was responding after the hashtag #DojaCatIsOverParty trended on Twitter over the weekend.The controversy was triggered by the emergence of an old song under the title Dindu Nuffin - a term used to disparage black victims of police brutality.Some people claimed the lyrics referred to Sandra Bland, a black woman who died in police custody in Texas in 2015, although Dlamini never mentioned her by name in the song.Subsequently, footage began to circulate of the singer participating on the video chatroom site Tiny Chat, making sexual comments to men who were reportedly members of the alt-right/incel community -  an online subculture of white supremacists who are ""involuntarily celibate"".In a statement posted to her Instagram on Sunday night, Dlamini tried to put the videos into context""I've used public chat rooms to socialize since I was a child,"" she wrote. ""I shouldn't have been on some of those chat room sites, but I personally have never been involved in any racist conversations. I'm sorry to everyone I offended.""A post shared by Doja Cat (@dojacat) on May 24, 2020 at 8:10pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by dojacatThe singer, whose father is South African actor Dumisani Dlamini, went on to say she identified as a ""black woman"" and that she was ""very proud of where I come from"".She confessed to writing the song Dindu Nuffin, describing it as a ""response to people who often used that term to hurt me"". However, she now accepts, ""it was a bad decision to use the term in my music"".Hours after publishing her statement, the singer took to Instagram Live, describing the text as ""an edited piece from me and the people I work with"", and promising to use her live stream to address the controversy in detail.After playing fans clips of the 98 video apologies she had drafted over the weekend, the star spent 30 minutes discussing the allegations against her.She described Dindu Nuffin as ""lyrically lost"" and ""maybe the worst song in the entire world"", but insisted it was ""in zero ways connected to police brutality or Sandra Bland"". ""To see a song, my song that I made, connected to an innocent black woman's death is one of the most awful rumours that I've ever encountered,"" she added.Dlamini again denied taking part in racist conversations, while admitting ""there is racism that happens across Tiny Chat"", suggesting it was more prevalent there than on other social media sites.However, the star added that she had been a moderator on the site before her musical career took off, and had banned users for  comments that were racist or abusive towards women.""I've been targeted by it and I know it's controllable,"" she said. ""The narrative that it's a white supremacist chat is absolutely 100% incorrect.""Dlamini further addressed people who had said she was guilty of ""internalised racism"" and self-hatred"", saying: ""I love my skin colour. I think I'm beautiful"".She acknowledged that some of her promotional photos may have been ""lightened to a certain point"" but claimed: ""That just happens. I'm not behind editing my photos"". And she also denied mocking Beyoncé, following a video that spread across social media in which she appears to refer to the star as ""Beyonkey"".""Beyoncé is the cream of the crop,"" she said. ""Beyoncé is the reason why I believe I can be who I am. Beyoncé is one of the driving forces of who I am in my career.

Gucci slashes 'stale' seasonal fashion shows,"Gucci has announced it will cut the number of fashion shows it holds every year in an effort to reduce waste.The company says the concept of seasonal clothes has become obsolete and will now host just two ""seasonless"" catwalk shows annually.The label said the traditional rota of spring/summer, autumn/winter, cruise and pre-fall shows was ""stale"".""Clothes should have a longer life than that which these words attribute to them,"" Gucci's creative director said.The label has no plans for a show in September, the time when it would traditionally show a new collection at the Milan fashion week.Alessandro Michele, the company's creative director, now imagines showing collections only in the autumn and spring, instead of five times a year. ""Two appointments a year are more than enough to give time to form a creative thought, and to give more time to this system,"" he said. Gucci is the first major label to make an adamant declaration about supporting the move to a leaner, less wasteful fashion system. Its powerhouse status in the fashion and celebrity worlds could potentially make this decision a gamechanger.Yves Saint Laurent, also owned by Kering, the Gucci parent company, has previously suggested it was considering leaving the fashion calendar behind too.In a statement last month its designer Anthony Vaccarello said the brand would ""take control"" of the fashion schedule ""conscious of the current circumstances and its waves of radical change"".The coronavirus shutdown has hit fashion houses hard as the non-stop round of international fashion shows was stopped in its tracks.The menswear and haute couture shows scheduled for June and July are off and a question mark hangs over September shows - if not any future catwalk events. But the shutdown has also given fashion houses a window of reflection, not just on the value of endlessly churning out new styles but also on the rights and wrongs of consumption. Michele's video conference on Monday elaborated on earlier ideas to this effect that he had posted on Gucci's Instagram account on Sunday. ""Above all, we understand we went way too far,"" Michele wrote. ""Our reckless actions have burned the house we live in. We conceived of ourselves as separated from nature, we felt cunning and almighty.""We usurped nature, we dominated and wounded it. We incited Prometheus, and buried Pan.""So much haughtiness made us lose our sisterhood with the butterflies, the flowers, the trees and the roots. So much outrageous greed made us lose the harmony and the care, the connection and the belonging.""Amongst the general public, thoughts have been turning the same way, with many people revisiting their old clothes, with the term ""shopping in your wardrobe"" touted online. Michele said he hopes that ultimately designers will come together to adopt a new calendar and aim to fashion.Previous champions of sustainability within the fashion industry include Dame Vivienne Westwood, who has been one of the most vocal campaigners on the issue.In recent years that fashion world has increasingly had to bow to growing global concerns regarding over-consumption. Traditional gender-based clothing has also had something of an overhaul, with celebrities, models and designers reflecting a more ""gender fluid"" landscape.Michele himself has been at the forefront of more progressive way of thinking since he joined Gucci five years ago. On the catwalk, his male models have worn pussy-bow silk blouses and dresses, he also dressed former One Direction star Harry Styles in earrings and Jared Leto in an evening gown at the Met Gala 2019. Dries Van Noten has led a number of independent designers calling for a radical overhaul of the industry, with fewer fashion shows and less product.Giorgio Armani announced his men's and women's shows will be combined in September, and his couture show will be held in January in Milan instead of Paris.",26 May 2020,entertainment

Brian May says he was 'very near death' after a heart attack,"Queen guitarist Brian May has revealed he ""could have died"" after being rushed to hospital following a heart attack.The 72-year-old said he was ""shocked"" to discover he needed surgery after what he described as a ""small"" heart attack earlier this month.The star's heart scare came a few days after a separate medical issue, when he thought he had ripped his glutes during a gardening accident.He explained his latest health problem in a video posted to Instagram.""I thought I was a very healthy guy,"" he said.""But I turned out to have three arteries that were congested and in danger of blocking the supply of blood to my heart.""May was subsequently fitted with three stents - tiny tubes that can hold open blocked arteries - and says he is back in full health.""I walked out with a heart that's very strong now, so I think I'm in good shape for some time to come."" Hmm ... Sheer Heart Attack eh ?  Well, I think I always worried a little bit about that album title. I wondered if it might upset some people who had actually had heart attacks. I’m actually quite relieved now that I’m in that club - and I don’t find it upsetting at all !  Take. care folks. And ... why did those discs in my spine get so squished?  Well I think 50 years of running around with a guitar strap over my left shoulder holding a heavy guitar might have something to do with it !  But it probably WAS all worth it ! BriA post shared by  Brian Harold May (@brianmayforreal) on May 24, 2020 at 7:42pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by brianmayforrealThe star made headlines earlier this month when he posted that he had torn a muscle in his gluteus maximus during a gardening accident.The injury left him in ""relentless pain,"" which he later discovered was due to another injury.""I told you I had a ripped muscle,"" he said in the seven-minute video he posted titled ""Sheer Heart Attack"" - a reference to the title of Queen's third album, released in 1974.""That was the way I was diagnosed and we thought it was like a bizarre gardening accident. ""I didn't realise that was amusing, really. I kind of forgot anything to do with the bum people find amusing... but anyway, it turned out to be not really the case. ""Now a week later I'm still in agony. I mean real agony. I wanted to jump at some points. I could not believe the pain. And people were saying, 'That's not like a ripped muscle, you don't get that amount of pain,' so eventually I had another MRI.'But this time I had one of the lower spine and, sure enough, what did we discover but I had a compressed sciatic nerve, quite severely compressed, and that's why I had the feeling that someone was putting a screwdriver in my back the whole time. It was excruciating.""So finally we started treating the thing for what it was. I'd been putting the ice packs in the wrong place for about 10 days.'That's one side of the story, and I'm a lot better now... But the rest of the story is a little more bizarre and a bit more shocking. ""I thought I was a very healthy guy. Everyone says, 'You've got a great blood pressure, you've got a great heart rate'. And I keep fit, I bike, good diet, not too much fat.""Anyway, I had - in the middle of the whole saga of the painful backside - I had a small heart attack. ""It's not something that did me any harm. It was about 40 minutes of pain in the chest and tightness, and that feeling in the arms and sweating.""Having realised he was having a heart attack, he called his doctor, who drove him to hospital for tests that exposed his underlying health problems.Given the choice between open heart surgery and having stents fitted, the musician chose the latter, and said the operation was remarkably straightforward.The star added that his experience should be a lesson to other people in their ""autumn years"".""What seems to be a very healthy heart may not be, and I would get it checked if I were you,"" he said. ""I was actually very near death [but] I didn't die. I came out and I would have been full of beans if it hadn't been for the leg.""May's health scare came shortly after Queen released a new version of We Are The Champions to raise money for the World Health Organization's Covid-19 fund.The single was renamed You Are The Champions as a tribute to medical staff, and was recorded under lockdown.",25 May 2020,entertainment

Doja Cat denies 'stripping for white supremacists' and using racist insults,"Pop star Doja Cat has denied taking part in racist conversations online, and apologised for a song that appeared to mock victims of police brutality.The star took to Instagram to address several accusations, including the suggestion she had stripped for white supremacists in a video chatroom.While she called that allegation ""100% incorrect"", the star admitted to ""dumb-ass behaviour"" in her past.""I'm sorry if I hurt you or made you feel in any way upset,"" she told fans.The singer/rapper, whose real name is Amalaratna Zandile Dlamini, was responding after the hashtag #DojaCatIsOverParty trended on Twitter over the weekend.The controversy was triggered by the emergence of an old song under the title Dindu Nuffin - a term used to disparage black victims of police brutality.Some people claimed the lyrics referred to Sandra Bland, a black woman who died in police custody in Texas in 2015, although Dlamini never mentioned her by name in the song.Subsequently, footage began to circulate of the singer participating on the video chatroom site Tiny Chat, making sexual comments to men who were reportedly members of the alt-right/incel community -  an online subculture of white supremacists who are ""involuntarily celibate"".In a statement posted to her Instagram on Sunday night, Dlamini tried to put the videos into context""I've used public chat rooms to socialize since I was a child,"" she wrote. ""I shouldn't have been on some of those chat room sites, but I personally have never been involved in any racist conversations. I'm sorry to everyone I offended.""A post shared by Doja Cat (@dojacat) on May 24, 2020 at 8:10pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by dojacatThe singer, whose father is South African actor Dumisani Dlamini, went on to say she identified as a ""black woman"" and that she was ""very proud of where I come from"".She confessed to writing the song Dindu Nuffin, describing it as a ""response to people who often used that term to hurt me"". However, she now accepts, ""it was a bad decision to use the term in my music"".Hours after publishing her statement, the singer took to Instagram Live, describing the text as ""an edited piece from me and the people I work with"", and promising to use her live stream to address the controversy in detail.After playing fans clips of the 98 video apologies she had drafted over the weekend, the star spent 30 minutes discussing the allegations against her.She described Dindu Nuffin as ""lyrically lost"" and ""maybe the worst song in the entire world"", but insisted it was ""in zero ways connected to police brutality or Sandra Bland"". ""To see a song, my song that I made, connected to an innocent black woman's death is one of the most awful rumours that I've ever encountered,"" she added.Dlamini again denied taking part in racist conversations, while admitting ""there is racism that happens across Tiny Chat"", suggesting it was more prevalent there than on other social media sites.However, the star added that she had been a moderator on the site before her musical career took off, and had banned users for  comments that were racist or abusive towards women.""I've been targeted by it and I know it's controllable,"" she said. ""The narrative that it's a white supremacist chat is absolutely 100% incorrect.""Dlamini further addressed people who had said she was guilty of ""internalised racism"" and self-hatred"", saying: ""I love my skin colour. I think I'm beautiful"".She acknowledged that some of her promotional photos may have been ""lightened to a certain point"" but claimed: ""That just happens. I'm not behind editing my photos"". And she also denied mocking Beyoncé, following a video that spread across social media in which she appears to refer to the star as ""Beyonkey"".""Beyoncé is the cream of the crop,"" she said. ""Beyoncé is the reason why I believe I can be who I am. Beyoncé is one of the driving forces of who I am in my career. Beyoncé is undeniably talented and every time anyone has ever came for Beyoncé, I was there. And that's all I have to say.""End of Youtube post  by BBC Radio 1Doja Cat's internet history was dragged into the spotlight after the breakout success of her disco anthem Say So, which recently went to number one in the US and number two in the UK.She concluded her video message by thanking fans for their support, and acknowledging that she was not an ideal role model.""This is the most serious you're ever going to hear me speak,"" she said.""To all of my young fans [and] people who look up to me, my behaviour isn't always something that needs to be followed. ""I'm not perfect - but at the end of the day I shouldn't be doing dumb [stuff]"".",26 May 2020,entertainment
Gucci slashes 'stale' seasonal fashion shows,"Gucci has announced it will cut the number of fashion shows it holds every year in an effort to reduce waste.The company says the concept of seasonal clothes has become obsolete and will now host just two ""seasonless"" catwalk shows annually.The label said the traditional rota of spring/summer, autumn/winter, cruise and pre-fall shows was ""stale"".""Clothes should have a longer life than that which these words attribute to them,"" Gucci's creative director said.The label has no plans for a show in September, the time when it would traditionally show a new collection at the Milan fashion week.Alessandro Michele, the company's creative director, now imagines showing collections only in the autumn and spring, instead of five times a year. ""Two appointments a year are more than enough to give time to form a creative thought, and to give more time to this system,"" he said. Gucci is the first major label to make an adamant declaration about supporting the move to a leaner, less wasteful fashion system. Its powerhouse status in the fashion and celebrity worlds could potentially make this decision a gamechanger.Yves Saint Laurent, also owned by Kering, the Gucci parent company, has previously suggested it was considering leaving the fashion calendar behind too.In a statement last month its designer Anthony Vaccarello said the brand would ""take control"" of the fashion schedule ""conscious of the current circumstances and its waves of radical change"".The coronavirus shutdown has hit fashion houses hard as the non-stop round of international fashion shows was stopped in its tracks.The menswear and haute couture shows scheduled for June and July are off and a question mark hangs over September shows - if not any future catwalk events. But the shutdown has also given fashion houses a window of reflection, not just on the value of endlessly churning out new styles but also on the rights and wrongs of consumption. Michele's video conference on Monday elaborated on earlier ideas to this effect that he had posted on Gucci's Instagram account on Sunday. ""Above all, we understand we went way too far,"" Michele wrote. ""Our reckless actions have burned the house we live in. We conceived of ourselves as separated from nature, we felt cunning and almighty.""We usurped nature, we dominated and wounded it. We incited Prometheus, and buried Pan.""So much haughtiness made us lose our sisterhood with the butterflies, the flowers, the trees and the roots. So much outrageous greed made us lose the harmony and the care, the connection and the belonging.""Amongst the general public, thoughts have been turning the same way, with many people revisiting their old clothes, with the term ""shopping in your wardrobe"" touted online. Michele said he hopes that ultimately designers will come together to adopt a new calendar and aim to fashion.Previous champions of sustainability within the fashion industry include Dame Vivienne Westwood, who has been one of the most vocal campaigners on the issue.In recent years that fashion world has increasingly had to bow to growing global concerns regarding over-consumption. Traditional gender-based clothing has also had something of an overhaul, with celebrities, models and designers reflecting a more ""gender fluid"" landscape.Michele himself has been at the forefront of more progressive way of thinking since he joined Gucci five years ago. On the catwalk, his male models have worn pussy-bow silk blouses and dresses, he also dressed former One Direction star Harry Styles in earrings and Jared Leto in an evening gown at the Met Gala 2019. Dries Van Noten has led a number of independent designers calling for a radical overhaul of the industry, with fewer fashion shows and less product.Giorgio Armani announced his men's and women's shows will be combined in September, and his couture show will be held in January in Milan instead of Paris.",26 May 2020,entertainment
Turner Prize 2020 axed and replaced by £100k fund for struggling artists,"The Turner Prize, the most high-profile award in British art, will not be given out this year because of the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Tate Britain, which has organised the prize since 1984, said it would be impossible to organise the annual nominees' exhibition.Instead, Tate will give bursaries each worth £10,000 to help 10 artists at this ""exceptionally difficult time"".Past winners include Damien Hirst, Grayson Perry and Steve McQueen.The last time it was not awarded was in 1990, after the award's sponsor went bankrupt.Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson said: ""Gallery closures and social distancing measures are vitally important, but they are also causing huge disruption to the lives and livelihoods of artists.""The practicalities of organising a Turner Prize exhibition are impossible in the current circumstances, so we have decided to help support even more artists during this exceptionally difficult time.""I think JMW Turner, who once planned to leave his fortune to support artists in their hour of need, would approve of our decision.""The prize is named after the great painter, who hoped to leave part of his estate to help ""distressed landscape painters"" and ""poor and decayed male artists"" after his death in 1851.Farquharson added: ""I appreciate visitors will be disappointed that there is no Turner Prize this year, but we can all look forward to it returning in 2021.""The move to give equal amounts of money to 10 artists follows last year's decision to split the usual £40,000 prize between the four shortlisted artists.The nominated quartet successfully argued that their work was ""incompatible with the competition format, whose tendency is to divide and to individualise"".The prize has been controversial in the past, gaining infamy in the 1990s with nominees and winners including Hirst's cows in formaldehyde, Tracey Emin's unmade bed and Martin Creed's empty room with lights going on and off.According to the Tate's announcement on Tuesday, this year's judging had been at an advanced stage.""This year's jury has spent the past 12 months visiting hundreds of exhibitions in preparation for selecting the nominees,"" it said.But the gallery said the decision to replace this year's prize with grants ""was made to help support a larger selection of artists through this period of profound disruption and uncertainty"".The usual prize money has been supplemented by extra sponsorship to allow Tate to provide Turner Bursaries worth £100,000. The recipients will be announced in June.",26 May 2020,entertainment
Brian May says he was 'very near death' after a heart attack,"Queen guitarist Brian May has revealed he ""could have died"" after being rushed to hospital following a heart attack.The 72-year-old said he was ""shocked"" to discover he needed surgery after what he described as a ""small"" heart attack earlier this month.The star's heart scare came a few days after a separate medical issue, when he thought he had ripped his glutes during a gardening accident.He explained his latest health problem in a video posted to Instagram.""I thought I was a very healthy guy,"" he said.""But I turned out to have three arteries that were congested and in danger of blocking the supply of blood to my heart.""May was subsequently fitted with three stents - tiny tubes that can hold open blocked arteries - and says he is back in full health.""I walked out with a heart that's very strong now, so I think I'm in good shape for some time to come."" Hmm ... Sheer Heart Attack eh ?  Well, I think I always worried a little bit about that album title. I wondered if it might upset some people who had actually had heart attacks.

UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale, one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment
The Joe Rogan Experience: Will Gompertz reviews episode #1470 with Elon Musk ★★★☆☆,"They used to say everybody had a book in them. Then it changed to everybody had a blog in them. Now, everybody has a podcast in them. And that's just where the book-blog-pod should stay in 99.9% of cases. But there are handful of people who have taken to podcasting like Luke Skywalker to a lightsaber and become masters of cyberspace broadcasting. Elizabeth Day has gone from journalist to novelist to prominent media figure with her How To Fail podcast. George The Poet has cut through with his meditative musings, while the footballer Peter Crouch has turned into a surprise comedy star with his laddish tales from the locker-room. In America - where the art of podcasting was honed with shows like Serial, This American Life and Radiolab - the medium has long had a seat at the top table of the entertainment business. As was made evident this week with the announcement that the Swedish streaming service Spotify had paid a huge sum of money - the Wall Street Journal reported the deal could be worth around $100 million (£82 million) - for exclusive rights to a Californian-based podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan is a famous personality in the US. He first made his name as a stand-up comic, then turned to acting, before hosting a TV show featuring wince-inducing dares, and between all this established himself as a respected mixed martial arts UFC commentator. He started his eponymous podcast in 2009 as a ""mates chatting"" sort of thing, which it basically still is, although some of his mates are now Senators and Harvard professors. Anyway, it works: the show is said to have over 190 million monthly downloads, which is a lot of listeners by any measure (it is also available for free on YouTube, for now).I visited his website to hear what all the fuss was about, and chose episode #1470 from a couple of weeks ago, in which Rogan chats to Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla car boss. He'd had Musk on the show before, offered him a puff on his joint (cannabis is legal in the state where the show is made), which Elon duly accepted, leading to headlines and a sharp drop in Tesla's share price. The episode I listened to didn't have any such incidents. The two men began by chewing the fat about Musk's newly-born baby, to whom the businessman and his partner had given a name that sounded like a line of code written by one of his company's boffs. Rogan was amused and enthusiastic as the conversation gently meandered towards the topic of connecting computers to our brains, a concept that appeared to enthral and appal the host in equal measure.Not so the quietly-spoken Musk, who considered the prospect of a ""whole brain interface"" where ""more of you would be in the cloud than in your body"", to be viable within decades. Don't worry if that seems like too long to wait, because he also thought if all went to plan, that in five years we won't have to talk anymore because we'll be able to communicate our unfettered thoughts through neural links. These were not small things to posit given the obvious ramifications, particularly for The Joe Rogan Experience: no talking, no podcast. But our host didn't seem concerned or particularly interested in interrogating the breezy claims his guest made with a matter-of-factness that equated to someone putting a live grenade in your hand and mentioning, by-the-by, it could be quite dangerous. That's not to say Rogan was disengaged. It's just that his natural curiosity tended to stop at wow without getting to why. Which is fine, that's the nature of the show: guests are allowed to talk as much and as long as they like, often for hours, with Rogan the interlocutor playing the role of everyman: a part he has nailed better than almost anyone else in the world of podcasts, if one was judging by numbers alone (downloads, YouTube views, Instagram followers etc.).He is, as they say nowadays, relatable. His listeners get him, like him; maybe even want to be him. He's not a show-pony, or a light-entertainment phoney: he's the all-American do it yourself modern man, tough but intelligent. Joe Rogan is the Bruce Springsteen of chat.The Boss has taken his brand global, whether Rogan can repeat the feat in the talk-show genre will be interesting to see. The two men have much in common. They share the same muscular male aesthetic, with a love of T-shirts and no BS. They're both from New Jersey. They both had troubled relationships with their fathers - Springsteen's dad was a bus driver, Rogan's a cop. And they both found fame as the front man on stage.Given the size of its investment, Spotify must be hoping Rogan can compete with Springsteen in terms of reach and appeal. I'm not so sure he can having listened to his show. Songs can be reinterpreted, meaning can morph and be personalised - less so with chat, which tends to be specific to the host and his or her culture. I quite enjoyed listening to his conversation with Musk, but I wouldn't download another show in a rush for entertainment's sake. It wasn't just because the entrepreneur could say almost anything without being challenged - there's a section about Covid-19 when I found my eyebrows rise while Joe's and Elon's were furrowed in agreement (I believe in previous episodes Rogan has been more sceptical). The main problem is my cultural reference points are different, I don't relate to Joe Rogan. I'm not interested in mixed martial arts or conspiracy theories or smoking weed or drinking hard liquor or camping or ""dumb things"". I don't care if a Tesla car can accelerate to 60 mph in under two seconds or want to hear what Elon Musk has to say to ""all the fools out there"" - another throwaway remark that went unchallenged.Nevertheless, the host clearly reflects the views and tastes of a vast number of American people, and has developed a format with which they can connect and hear his thoughts and those of his guests (male-skewed, judging by the recent roster). And that's why I will continue to download his show: Not to be amused but to be informed.  Listen to The Joe Rogan Experience and you hear America.

JK Rowling unveils first non-Harry Potter children's book,"JK Rowling has surprised fans with the announcement of a brand new children's book, which she is publishing on her website in daily instalments.The Ickabog is a fairytale, and is Rowling's first children's story not to be connected to Harry Potter.She wrote it more than a decade ago for her own children, and has decided to dust it off during the pandemic.It's for ""children on lockdown, or even those back at school during these strange, unsettling times"", she wrote.The author said she said she originally intended to publish The Ickabog after the seventh and final Harry Potter novel came out in 2007.But she decided to take a break from publishing, and put the manuscript in her attic.""Over time I came to think of it as a story that belonged to my two younger children, because I'd read it to them in the evenings when they were little, which has always been a happy family memory,"" she wrote on her website.A few weeks ago, she suggested to her children that she might retrieve it from her loft.""My now teenagers were touchingly enthusiastic, so downstairs came the very dusty box, and for the last few weeks I've been immersed in a fictional world I thought I'd never enter again. As I worked to finish the book, I started reading chapters nightly to the family again.""This was one of the most extraordinary experiences of my writing life, as The Ickabog's first two readers told me what they remember from when they were tiny, and demanded the reinstatement of bits they'd particularly liked (I obeyed).""Opening the box was like opening a time capsule.

Turner Prize 2020 axed and replaced by £100k fund for struggling artists,"The Turner Prize, the most high-profile award in British art, will not be given out this year because of the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Tate Britain, which has organised the prize since 1984, said it would be impossible to organise the annual nominees' exhibition.Instead, Tate will give bursaries each worth £10,000 to help 10 artists at this ""exceptionally difficult time"".Past winners include Damien Hirst, Grayson Perry and Steve McQueen.The last time it was not awarded was in 1990, after the award's sponsor went bankrupt.Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson said: ""Gallery closures and social distancing measures are vitally important, but they are also causing huge disruption to the lives and livelihoods of artists.""The practicalities of organising a Turner Prize exhibition are impossible in the current circumstances, so we have decided to help support even more artists during this exceptionally difficult time.""I think JMW Turner, who once planned to leave his fortune to support artists in their hour of need, would approve of our decision.""The prize is named after the great painter, who hoped to leave part of his estate to help ""distressed landscape painters"" and ""poor and decayed male artists"" after his death in 1851.Farquharson added: ""I appreciate visitors will be disappointed that there is no Turner Prize this year, but we can all look forward to it returning in 2021.""The move to give equal amounts of money to 10 artists follows last year's decision to split the usual £40,000 prize between the four shortlisted artists.The nominated quartet successfully argued that their work was ""incompatible with the competition format, whose tendency is to divide and to individualise"".The prize has been controversial in the past, gaining infamy in the 1990s with nominees and winners including Hirst's cows in formaldehyde, Tracey Emin's unmade bed and Martin Creed's empty room with lights going on and off.According to the Tate's announcement on Tuesday, this year's judging had been at an advanced stage.""This year's jury has spent the past 12 months visiting hundreds of exhibitions in preparation for selecting the nominees,"" it said.But the gallery said the decision to replace this year's prize with grants ""was made to help support a larger selection of artists through this period of profound disruption and uncertainty"".The usual prize money has been supplemented by extra sponsorship to allow Tate to provide Turner Bursaries worth £100,000. The recipients will be announced in June.",26 May 2020,entertainment
Doja Cat denies 'stripping for white supremacists' and using racist insults,"Pop star Doja Cat has denied taking part in racist conversations online, and apologised for a song that appeared to mock victims of police brutality.The star took to Instagram to address several accusations, including the suggestion she had stripped for white supremacists in a video chatroom.While she called that allegation ""100% incorrect"", the star admitted to ""dumb-ass behaviour"" in her past.""I'm sorry if I hurt you or made you feel in any way upset,"" she told fans.The singer/rapper, whose real name is Amalaratna Zandile Dlamini, was responding after the hashtag #DojaCatIsOverParty trended on Twitter over the weekend.The controversy was triggered by the emergence of an old song under the title Dindu Nuffin - a term used to disparage black victims of police brutality.Some people claimed the lyrics referred to Sandra Bland, a black woman who died in police custody in Texas in 2015, although Dlamini never mentioned her by name in the song.Subsequently, footage began to circulate of the singer participating on the video chatroom site Tiny Chat, making sexual comments to men who were reportedly members of the alt-right/incel community -  an online subculture of white supremacists who are ""involuntarily celibate"".In a statement posted to her Instagram on Sunday night, Dlamini tried to put the videos into context""I've used public chat rooms to socialize since I was a child,"" she wrote. ""I shouldn't have been on some of those chat room sites, but I personally have never been involved in any racist conversations. I'm sorry to everyone I offended.""The singer, whose father is South African actor Dumisani Dlamini, went on to say she identified as a ""black woman"" and that she was ""very proud of where I come from"".She confessed to writing the song Dindu Nuffin, describing it as a ""response to people who often used that term to hurt me"". However, she now accepts, ""it was a bad decision to use the term in my music"".Hours after publishing her statement, the singer took to Instagram Live, describing the text as ""an edited piece from me and the people I work with"", and promising to use her live stream to address the controversy in detail.After playing fans clips of the 98 video apologies she had drafted over the weekend, the star spent 30 minutes discussing the allegations against her.She described Dindu Nuffin as ""lyrically lost"" and ""maybe the worst song in the entire world"", but insisted it was ""in zero ways connected to police brutality or Sandra Bland"". ""To see a song, my song that I made, connected to an innocent black woman's death is one of the most awful rumours that I've ever encountered,"" she added.Dlamini again denied taking part in racist conversations, while admitting ""there is racism that happens across Tiny Chat"", suggesting it was more prevalent there than on other social media sites.However, the star added that she had been a moderator on the site before her musical career took off, and had banned users for  comments that were racist or abusive towards women.""I've been targeted by it and I know it's controllable,"" she said. ""The narrative that it's a white supremacist chat is absolutely 100% incorrect.""Dlamini further addressed people who had said she was guilty of ""internalised racism"" and self-hatred"", saying: ""I love my skin colour. I think I'm beautiful"".She acknowledged that some of her promotional photos may have been ""lightened to a certain point"" but claimed: ""That just happens. I'm not behind editing my photos"". And she also denied mocking Beyoncé, following a video that spread across social media in which she appears to refer to the star as ""Beyonkey"".""Beyoncé is the cream of the crop,"" she said. ""Beyoncé is the reason why I believe I can be who I am. Beyoncé is one of the driving forces of who I am in my career. Beyoncé is undeniably talented and every time anyone has ever came for Beyoncé, I was there. And that's all I have to say.""End of Youtube post  by BBC Radio 1Doja Cat's internet history was dragged into the spotlight after the breakout success of her disco anthem Say So, which recently went to number one in the US and number two in the UK.She concluded her video message by thanking fans for their support, and acknowledging that she was not an ideal role model.""This is the most serious you're ever going to hear me speak,"" she said.""To all of my young fans [and] people who look up to me, my behaviour isn't always something that needs to be followed. ""I'm not perfect - but at the end of the day I shouldn't be doing dumb [stuff]"".",26 May 2020,entertainment
Brian May says he was 'very near death' after a heart attack,"Queen guitarist Brian May has revealed he ""could have died"" after being rushed to hospital following a heart attack.The 72-year-old said he was ""shocked"" to discover he needed surgery after what he described as a ""small"" heart attack earlier this month.The star's heart scare came a few days after a separate medical issue, when he thought he had ripped his glutes during a gardening accident.He explained his latest health problem in a video posted to Instagram.""I thought I was a very healthy guy,"" he said.""But I turned out to have three arteries that were congested and in danger of blocking the supply of blood to my heart.""May was subsequently fitted with three stents - tiny tubes that can hold open blocked arteries - and says he is back in full health.""I walked out with a heart that's very strong now, so I think I'm in good shape for some time to come.""The star made headlines earlier this month when he posted that he had torn a muscle in his gluteus maximus during a gardening accident.The injury left him in ""relentless pain,"" which he later discovered was due to another injury.""I told you I had a ripped muscle,"" he said in the seven-minute video he posted titled ""Sheer Heart Attack"" - a reference to the title of Queen's third album, released in 1974.""That was the way I was diagnosed and we thought it was like a bizarre gardening accident. ""I didn't realise that was amusing, really. I kind of forgot anything to do with the bum people find amusing... but anyway, it turned out to be not really the case. ""Now a week later I'm still in agony. I mean real agony. I wanted to jump at some points. I could not believe the pain. And people were saying, 'That's not like a ripped muscle, you don't get that amount of pain,' so eventually I had another MRI.'But this time I had one of the lower spine and, sure enough, what did we discover but I had a compressed sciatic nerve, quite severely compressed, and that's why I had the feeling that someone was putting a screwdriver in my back the whole time. It was excruciating.""So finally we started treating the thing for what it was. I'd been putting the ice packs in the wrong place for about 10 days.'That's one side of the story, and I'm a lot better now... But the rest of the story is a little more bizarre and a bit more shocking. ""I thought I was a very healthy guy. Everyone says, 'You've got a great blood pressure, you've got a great heart rate'. And I keep fit, I bike, good diet, not too much fat.""Anyway, I had - in the middle of the whole saga of the painful backside - I had a small heart attack. ""It's not something that did me any harm. It was about 40 minutes of pain in the chest and tightness, and that feeling in the arms and sweating.""Having realised he was having a heart attack, he called his doctor, who drove him to hospital for tests that exposed his underlying health problems.Given the choice between open heart surgery and having stents fitted, the musician chose the latter, and said the operation was remarkably straightforward.The star added that his experience should be a lesson to other people in their ""autumn years"".""What seems to be a very healthy heart may not be, and I would get it checked if I were you,"" he said. ""I was actually very near death [but] I didn't die. I came out and I would have been full of beans if it hadn't been for the leg.""May's health scare came shortly after Queen released a new version of We Are The Champions to raise money for the World Health Organization's Covid-19 fund.The single was renamed You Are The Champions as a tribute to medical staff, and was recorded under lockdown.",25 May 2020,entertainment
The Archers returns with a lockdown twist,"The Archers returned to BBC Radio 4 on Monday, with a ""new style"" forced upon the show by the coronavirus lockdown.Large cast recordings with interaction between multiple characters have been scrapped in favour of monologues recorded at the actors' homes.""It might take a few episodes for listeners to get used to the new style,"" said Charlotte Martin, who plays busybody Susan Carter.""It will be different [but] I think it will be enjoyable,"" she said.The rural drama resumed after a three-week break in which classic episodes kept listeners in touch with the residents of Ambridge.The first voice to be heard in the ""lockdown era"" was Tim Bentinck, who plays David Archer. The actor said he was ""incredibly proud"" to be pioneering the new format.""As from Monday, the story of the now-virus-hit Ambridge will be told from the minds of the village characters, in a way that has never been heard in all its sixty-nine years,"" he wrote on Twitter.For the first time, listeners will get to hear what the characters ""really think"", he continued.""As actors, we're always after the sub-text - what we say is not necessarily what we mean. Now, what we think is not necessarily what we say!""Although the characters will be subject to the same restrictions as the rest of the UK, the plot won't focus solely on coronavirus - with upcoming episodes featuring storylines about Tracy and Harrison competing to become captain of the village cricket team, and a minor emergency caused by a broken down forage harvester. Last week, the series' editor Jeremy Howe revealed how coronavirus had thrown the soap's plans into disarray.""We binned 12 scripts and five weeks' worth of storylines that were about to be written,"" he told Radio Times. ""We then started inventing stories that were set in Ambridge, where the coronavirus had now arrived, that could be told in a way that both reflected the lockdown and could be recorded in the cast's homes. ""I told the team - keep it simple.""For the actors, the lockdown meant recording their monologues at home in hastily-constructed makeshift studios.Annabelle Dowler, who plays Kirsty Miller, has been recording her scripts in her daughter's wardrobe, surrounded by duvets and and an old mattress to mask any external noises.  On her Twitter account, she shared a photo of the notice she'd attached to the wardrobe door, warning her children to keep their distance.""Stay away and be silent otherwise you will get into trouble with the BBC and we will have no iPlayer for the rest of the lockdown!""Her co-star Charlotte Martin explained the challenges of recording in her bedroom. ""A studio is soundproof, whereas suddenly we were having to do it in our own homes,"" she said.""I've got my two daughters home and making sure everything is quiet, that nobody is opening doors, that was tricky. I think my husband came up the stairs at one point and we had to redo that!""She added that, as the crew adapt to new ways of recording the 69-year-old drama, they might be able to start incorporating more voices.""There may be ways that we can get actors talking to each other or create ways in which we can interact with more than one character at a time, but that will be in the future.""In the meantime, the lockdown has provided one character with a lucky escape.  Before the lockdown, Kirsty was due to marry handyman Philip Moss, who listeners recently discovered was an illegal gangmaster - employing slave labour in his building firm.For now, at least, those plans are on hold.",25 May 2020,entertainment
