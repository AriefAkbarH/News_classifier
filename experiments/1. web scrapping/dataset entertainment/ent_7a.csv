Ruby Rose leaves Batwoman - and other stars who exited major roles,"The Australian actress Ruby Rose is to leave her role as comic book superhero Batwoman after just one series.Rose said it had been a ""very difficult decision"" not to return to the show, which is shown in the UK on E4.Batwoman, which began on the CW network last year, is the first superhero show to have an openly gay lead character.Its producers said they were ""firmly committed"" to the show's ""long-term"" future and would re-cast the role with another member of the LGBTQ community.Rose, who is openly gay, said she was ""truly grateful... to everyone who made season one a success"". The 34-year-old said she had ""the utmost respect"" for everyone involved and that the decision to leave had not been ""made lightly"".Rose faced a backlash on social media when she was cast as Batwoman, with some saying the role should have gone to a lesbian actress.The actress, who has called herself ""gender-fluid"" in interviews, later deleted her Twitter profile, though she remains active on Instagram.Last year Rose revealed she had suffered an injury while filming the series that had required her to undergo emergency surgery.The actress said she had ""herniated two discs doing stunts"" - but Deadline reported the injury was not the reason for her departure.Born in Melbourne in 1986, Rose played Stella Carlin in Orange is the New Black and has appeared in such films as Pitch Perfect 3 and The Meg.Yet she is far from the first actor to leave or be replaced in a major film or TV show.George Lazenby famously walked away from the role of James Bond after making just one appearance in the popular spy film series.The model turned actor later admitted he had been persuaded by his then-manager - the late Ronan O'Rahilly - to seek other opportunities.""I thought he knew what he was talking about so I listened to him,"" the Australian told an audience at the National Film Theatre last year.Lazenby's single outing as Bond, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was released in 1969 and is now a firm fan favourite.Christopher Eccleston was cast as The Doctor when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 - but he departed after a single series.The actor, who was replaced by David Tennant, later said he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture"" of the show.""My relationship with my three immediate superiors... broke down irreparably during the first block of filming and it never recovered,"" he elaborated in 2018.The actor, currently to be seen in The A Word on BBC One, also said he had been ""out of his comfort zone"" playing the sci-fi drama's time-travelling hero.Edward Norton was cast as Bruce Banner in 2008's The Incredible Hulk but did not reprise the role in Marvel Studios' subsequent comic-book blockbusters.Its president Kevin Feige later said the role had been recast out of a ""need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members"".Speaking last year, Norton called Feige's 2010 statement ""cheap"" and that his exit had been the result of differing views on how to depict the character.""Ultimately they weren't going for long, dark and serious,"" said Norton, who was replaced by Mark Ruffalo when The Hulk returned in 2012's Avengers Assemble.Terrence Howard, who played James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in 2008's Iron Man, is another actor to be replaced in Marvel's superhero film series.He later claimed he was offered less money than he had been promised to reprise the role, which Don Cheadle has played since 2010's Iron Man 2.Sharon Gless played Christine Cagney in Cagney and Lacey for seven years, winning two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for her pains.Yet she was not the first actress to play the part in the popular US TV series about two female police detectives solving crimes in New York City.Loretta Swit played Cagney in the original TV movie but was not able to continue in the role when the CBS show went to series.Meg Foster was then cast, only to be replaced after six episodes because CBS allegedly wanted someone ""more feminine"" in the role.Speaking in 2012, Gless praised her co-star Tyne Daly for ""welcoming me as if she had not had anybody before me"".""I know her heart was hurting because she loved her last Cagney,"" she revealed.When Men Behaving Badly first began in 1992, the two flatmates were played by Martin Clunes and Harry Enfield.According to Clunes, though, the show that ITV produced did not match Enfield's hopes for it.""His original vision was for it not to be like a usual sitcom,"" Clunes told The Guardian in 2013. ""Then we made the pilot and it shocked him.""You could see Harry wanted out,"" he continued. ""He was under contract, though, so had to do one series.""Neil Morrissey was subsequently cast as Clunes' flatmate in the show, which continued on ITV for another series before being picked up by the BBC.",20 May 2020,entertainment

Joe Rogan signs with Spotify in major and exclusive podcast deal,"Joe Rogan has signed an exclusive deal with Spotify, which will see his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, disappear from all other platforms.The multi-year deal is believed to be worth $100m (£82 million), according to the Wall Street Journal.Rogan's podcast, which is one of the most popular in the world, will arrive on the streaming giant on 1 September.It will then be housed there exclusively by the end of the year, and removed from all other platforms.""It will remain free, and it will be the exact same show,"" said Rogan. ""It's just a licensing deal, so Spotify won't have any creative control over the show.""They want me to just continue doing it the way I'm doing it right now.""I'm excited to have the support of the largest audio platform in the world and I hope you folks are there when we make the switch!""Joe Rogan is a US stand-up comedian and TV host-turned-provocateur, who launched his podcast in 2009 - in the early days of the medium.He invites a wide range of guests, including actors, musicians, comedians, politicians and conspiracy theorists on to the show, which has garnered a huge audience. Last year the podcast was downloaded 190 million times per month.Rogan has previously advocated for ""long-form media"" - and his own podcast episodes regularly run to two or three hours.The controversial entertainer also has 8.42 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, which has up until now shown the interviews in video form (this will stop when the new Spotify deal kicks in).But he has also attracted criticism - Rogan has been accused of making sexist, racist and transphobic comments in his podcasts.""The Joe Rogan Experience has become one of the internet's foremost vectors for anti-wokeness,"" wrote Justin Peters in Slate.In 2018, Rogan's show hit the headlines when the host shared a cannabis joint with Tesla boss Elon Musk, after which the company's stocks fell by 9%.Rogan has been credited as being an ""unlikely political influencer"" by the New York Times, due to his reach. In January, he informed his legions of followers that he would ""probably vote for Bernie"", referring to the then Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders, who received increased press coverage as a result.However, since Joe Biden became the party's presumptive nominee, Rogan has said he is more likely to vote for President Trump.The kind of figures involved in the deal are incredibly rare in the podcast world - and Rogan will now likely earn more money than most musicians on Spotify.""Joe Rogan just got paid the equivalent value of over 26 billion streams for a podcast licence,"" wrote Tom Gray, director of the royalties, music copyright and licensing society, PRS for Music.""A musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights."" added music writer Ted Gioia.Gioia suggested this means ""Spotify values Rogan more than any musician in the history of the world"".TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan predicted the deal could ""lead the way to others"", but noted that the exclusivity clause would leave many fans locked out.""It might do what Sky did for a lot of shows,"" he tweeted. ""Lift them up, but put them behind a wall that the culture mostly then ignores.""Although Rogan has said the podcast will still be free to access, Spotify will be hoping the increased traffic to its service will lead to a significant increase in subscriber numbers.It is generally difficult to make large amounts of money in the crowded world of podcasts. As most podcasts are free to download, many presenters and producers attempt to make money from endorsements and advertising. A platform-exclusive deal such as this is very rare.

BBC Three could return as an on-air channel,"The BBC is considering the case for bringing back BBC Three as a regular TV channel, four years after it was taken off air and moved online.The youth channel, which commissioned hits like Normal People and Fleabag, will also have its budget doubled.It left linear TV in 2016 to save £30m, and because the corporation said young people were watching more shows online.The BBC now says it is ""considering the case"" for returning the channel to ""linear television"".A BBC spokesman said ""we'd be wrong not to back a service that is doing better than anyone could have ever conceived"".The turnaround will be formally announced as part of the BBC's annual plan on Wednesday, but there was no news about the fate of BBC Four, which has been rumoured for the axe.The corporation warned that putting BBC Three back on TV will mean reductions in other areas, especially as the BBC's income has been reduced by £125 million during the coronavirus outbreak. But it says those decisions won't be made until the autumn when there is a clearer picture of the BBC's finances. However, the BBC did say it had no plans to close BBC Four at the moment.BBC Three launched in 2003 and made its name with hits like Little Britain and Gavin & Stacey.In recent years, it has also been behind comedy and drama successes like This Country, People Just Do Nothing, My Left Nut and the Bafta-winning Killed By My Debt.It has also made the reality shows RuPaul's Drag Race UK and Glow Up; as well as hard-hitting documentaries like Stacey Dooley's investigations and Jesy Nelson's Odd One Out.Normal People, an adaptation of the Sally Rooney novel, recently propelled BBC Three to its biggest ever week on iPlayer, with 21.8 million requests for the channel's programmes.Its shows have been aired on regular TV as well as online, including in a dedicated zone on BBC One after the News At Ten since last spring.When it moved online in February 2016, the BBC Trust said ""independent evidence shows younger audiences are watching more online and watching less linear TV"".But BBC Three reached 8% of British 16-34-year-olds per week in 2018/19, down from 22% in 2015/16.The BBC now says its research shows there is a potential large linear audience for the channel's programmes, which it says are reaching both young people and the wider audience in ""big numbers"".The news comes two months after director general Tony Hall told MPs the board was looking to ""divert more resources into BBC Three to build the kind of creative content they're delivering"".But with the corporation needing to make savings, there has been speculation that BBC Four may be among the casualties.A petition calling for the channel to be saved has attracted more than 58,000 signatures.In its plan, the BBC said it was ""exploring potential commercial opportunities"" outside the UK for BBC Four to become a global subscription service.",19 May 2020,entertainment
Feud erupts over Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's US chart position,"Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber have defended themselves after rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine accused them of buying the number one spot on the US chart.The rapper claimed the pop stars had bought tens of thousands of copies of their charity duet Stuck With U to boost its position.He also said some streams of his song Gooba were improperly discounted, leaving it in third place on the chart.Grande, Bieber and chart compilers Billboard have all denied the claims.Bieber called the rapper's accusations ""a lie"", while Grande advised him to ""take a moment to humble yourself"".Billboard, which publishes the US charts, posted a lengthy article refuting each of his points while explaining how positions were calculated.""Overall, Stuck With U drew 28.1 million US streams, 26.3 million in radio airplay audience and 108,000 sold in the tracking week,"" it explained. ""Gooba had 55.3 million US streams, 172,000 in radio airplay audience and 24,000 sold.""Those sums resulted in the songs' respective rankings on this week's Hot 100.""End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevoGooba is Tekashi 6ix9ine's first single since he was released from prison into house arrest last month.He was serving time after pleading guilty to multiple counts of racketeering, firearms offences and drug trafficking, and was freed over fears that his chronic asthma would make him vulnerable to the coronavirus.The 23-year-old first expressed his dissatisfaction on Friday in an Instagram video where he claimed the charts were being rigged.He presented forecasts that were purportedly sent to major record labels on Thursday, which showed Grande and Bieber's duet charting at number five.6ix9ine then showed a second email, which he claimed was sent at ""the last second"" on Thursday night (the cut-off point for sales to be included in the chart). It showed that Stuck With U had sold an additional 60,000 copies, boosting it to number one.""Literally, you're manipulating the charts now,"" he said. ""So, Billboard, the world is watching.""When the charts were announced on Monday, the rapper intensified his criticism, claiming the pop stars had bought tens of thousands of copies of their own single.""Understand this, they bought 30,000 or so units on six credit cards,"" he said. ""It's all manipulated, it's all fabricated,"" he added, before accusing Billboard of ""disqualifying"" 20 million or so of Gooba's streams.""I want the world to know that Billboard is a lie. You can buy number ones.""Bieber rejected several of the rapper's arguments. ""He says his streams don't count,"" he wrote. ""Yes they do, but he is counting his global streams and this is a domestic chart, so only domestic streams count.""He added that the additional 60,000 sales of Stuck With U were not reported until Thursday as a tactic to beat the competition. ""That's called strategy,"" said the singer.And he said it was impossible to buy 30,000 copies of a single on six credit cards because bulk purchases were against chart rules.Grande responded with her own statement on Instagram. Although she didn't mention 6ix9ine by name, she made her feelings clear.After thanking fans for their support, the singer said: ""You cannot discredit this as hard as you try.""She added: ""To anybody that is displeased with their placement on the chart this week... I ask you to take a moment to humble yourself. Be grateful you're even here.""Billboard's column went into forensic detail on how the charts were compiled.Grande and Bieber's tally was boosted by the availability of a physical/digital bundle - meaning fans could buy an autographed copy of the single, to be posted at a later date, along with a download that was available immediately. Both counted as an separate sale.Setting the feud aside, Grande and Bieber's manager Scooter Braun emphasised that proceeds from their single were going to the First Responders Children's Fund.""Thank you to all the first responders and their families,"" he wrote on Instagram.

Joe Rogan signs with Spotify in major and exclusive podcast deal,"Joe Rogan has signed an exclusive deal with Spotify, which will see his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, disappear from all other platforms.The multi-year deal is believed to be worth $100m (£82 million), according to the Wall Street Journal.Rogan's podcast, which is one of the most popular in the world, will arrive on the streaming giant on 1 September.It will then be housed there exclusively by the end of the year, and removed from all other platforms.""It will remain free, and it will be the exact same show,"" said Rogan. ""It's just a licensing deal, so Spotify won't have any creative control over the show.""They want me to just continue doing it the way I'm doing it right now.""I'm excited to have the support of the largest audio platform in the world and I hope you folks are there when we make the switch!""Joe Rogan is a US stand-up comedian and TV host-turned-provocateur, who launched his podcast in 2009 - in the early days of the medium.He invites a wide range of guests, including actors, musicians, comedians, politicians and conspiracy theorists on to the show, which has garnered a huge audience. Last year the podcast was downloaded 190 million times per month.Rogan has previously advocated for ""long-form media"" - and his own podcast episodes regularly run to two or three hours.The controversial entertainer also has 8.42 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, which has up until now shown the interviews in video form (this will stop when the new Spotify deal kicks in).But he has also attracted criticism - Rogan has been accused of making sexist, racist and transphobic comments in his podcasts.""The Joe Rogan Experience has become one of the internet's foremost vectors for anti-wokeness,"" wrote Justin Peters in Slate.In 2018, Rogan's show hit the headlines when the host shared a cannabis joint with Tesla boss Elon Musk, after which the company's stocks fell by 9%.Rogan has been credited as being an ""unlikely political influencer"" by the New York Times, due to his reach. In January, he informed his legions of followers that he would ""probably vote for Bernie"", referring to the then Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders, who received increased press coverage as a result.However, since Joe Biden became the party's presumptive nominee, Rogan has said he is more likely to vote for President Trump.The kind of figures involved in the deal are incredibly rare in the podcast world - and Rogan will now likely earn more money than most musicians on Spotify.""Joe Rogan just got paid the equivalent value of over 26 billion streams for a podcast licence,"" wrote Tom Gray, director of the royalties, music copyright and licensing society, PRS for Music.""A musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights."" added music writer Ted Gioia.Gioia suggested this means ""Spotify values Rogan more than any musician in the history of the world"".TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan predicted the deal could ""lead the way to others"", but noted that the exclusivity clause would leave many fans locked out.""It might do what Sky did for a lot of shows,"" he tweeted. ""Lift them up, but put them behind a wall that the culture mostly then ignores.""Although Rogan has said the podcast will still be free to access, Spotify will be hoping the increased traffic to its service will lead to a significant increase in subscriber numbers.It is generally difficult to make large amounts of money in the crowded world of podcasts. As most podcasts are free to download, many presenters and producers attempt to make money from endorsements and advertising. A platform-exclusive deal such as this is very rare.

BBC Three could return as an on-air channel,"The BBC is considering the case for bringing back BBC Three as a regular TV channel, four years after it was taken off air and moved online.The youth channel, which commissioned hits like Normal People and Fleabag, will also have its budget doubled.It left linear TV in 2016 to save £30m, and because the corporation said young people were watching more shows online.The BBC now says it is ""considering the case"" for returning the channel to ""linear television"".A BBC spokesman said ""we'd be wrong not to back a service that is doing better than anyone could have ever conceived"".The turnaround will be formally announced as part of the BBC's annual plan on Wednesday, but there was no news about the fate of BBC Four, which has been rumoured for the axe.The corporation warned that putting BBC Three back on TV will mean reductions in other areas, especially as the BBC's income has been reduced by £125 million during the coronavirus outbreak. But it says those decisions won't be made until the autumn when there is a clearer picture of the BBC's finances. However, the BBC did say it had no plans to close BBC Four at the moment.BBC Three launched in 2003 and made its name with hits like Little Britain and Gavin & Stacey.In recent years, it has also been behind comedy and drama successes like This Country, People Just Do Nothing, My Left Nut and the Bafta-winning Killed By My Debt.It has also made the reality shows RuPaul's Drag Race UK and Glow Up; as well as hard-hitting documentaries like Stacey Dooley's investigations and Jesy Nelson's Odd One Out.Normal People, an adaptation of the Sally Rooney novel, recently propelled BBC Three to its biggest ever week on iPlayer, with 21.8 million requests for the channel's programmes.Its shows have been aired on regular TV as well as online, including in a dedicated zone on BBC One after the News At Ten since last spring.When it moved online in February 2016, the BBC Trust said ""independent evidence shows younger audiences are watching more online and watching less linear TV"".But BBC Three reached 8% of British 16-34-year-olds per week in 2018/19, down from 22% in 2015/16.The BBC now says its research shows there is a potential large linear audience for the channel's programmes, which it says are reaching both young people and the wider audience in ""big numbers"".The news comes two months after director general Tony Hall told MPs the board was looking to ""divert more resources into BBC Three to build the kind of creative content they're delivering"".But with the corporation needing to make savings, there has been speculation that BBC Four may be among the casualties.A petition calling for the channel to be saved has attracted more than 58,000 signatures.In its plan, the BBC said it was ""exploring potential commercial opportunities"" outside the UK for BBC Four to become a global subscription service.",19 May 2020,entertainment
Feud erupts over Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's US chart position,"Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber have defended themselves after rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine accused them of buying the number one spot on the US chart.The rapper claimed the pop stars had bought tens of thousands of copies of their charity duet Stuck With U to boost its position.He also said some streams of his song Gooba were improperly discounted, leaving it in third place on the chart.Grande, Bieber and chart compilers Billboard have all denied the claims.Bieber called the rapper's accusations ""a lie"", while Grande advised him to ""take a moment to humble yourself"".Billboard, which publishes the US charts, posted a lengthy article refuting each of his points while explaining how positions were calculated.""Overall, Stuck With U drew 28.1 million US streams, 26.3 million in radio airplay audience and 108,000 sold in the tracking week,"" it explained. ""Gooba had 55.3 million US streams, 172,000 in radio airplay audience and 24,000 sold.""Those sums resulted in the songs' respective rankings on this week's Hot 100.""End of Youtube post  by ArianaGrandeVevoGooba is Tekashi 6ix9ine's first single since he was released from prison into house arrest last month.He was serving time after pleading guilty to multiple counts of racketeering, firearms offences and drug trafficking, and was freed over fears that his chronic asthma would make him vulnerable to the coronavirus.The 23-year-old first expressed his dissatisfaction on Friday in an Instagram video where he claimed the charts were being rigged.He presented forecasts that were purportedly sent to major record labels on Thursday, which showed Grande and Bieber's duet charting at number five.6ix9ine then showed a second email, which he claimed was sent at ""the last second"" on Thursday night (the cut-off point for sales to be included in the chart). It showed that Stuck With U had sold an additional 60,000 copies, boosting it to number one.""Literally, you're manipulating the charts now,"" he said. ""So, Billboard, the world is watching.""When the charts were announced on Monday, the rapper intensified his criticism, claiming the pop stars had bought tens of thousands of copies of their own single.""Understand this, they bought 30,000 or so units on six credit cards,"" he said. ""It's all manipulated, it's all fabricated,"" he added, before accusing Billboard of ""disqualifying"" 20 million or so of Gooba's streams.""I want the world to know that Billboard is a lie. You can buy number ones.""Bieber rejected several of the rapper's arguments. ""He says his streams don't count,"" he wrote. ""Yes they do, but he is counting his global streams and this is a domestic chart, so only domestic streams count.""He added that the additional 60,000 sales of Stuck With U were not reported until Thursday as a tactic to beat the competition.

How live entertainment is evolving online to be a lifeline in lockdown,"From gigs to plays and quizzes, live entertainment has moved online during coronavirus lockdown - and creative minds are coming up with new ideas to give us back some of the human connection we've lost.Every Saturday for the past two months, Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has sat down and written a song.Well, he has co-written a song - with 5,000 fans on Instagram.He asks them for chords, comes up with melodies, and puts them to a vote. He then asks for ideas for lyrics before coming back an hour later with a finished track. ""Some are really good,"" he says. End of Youtube post  by Snow PatrolLightbody also performs solo online gigs from home, but wanted to do something more collaborative too.""You can say absolutely anything in this. It's therapeutic and cathartic for me,"" he explains.""In a 'gig', I chat a little bit, but you can't really read the comments because you're playing songs. But with this, it feels like you're engaging with everybody.""The fans also vote for the set lists in his regular online concerts. ""I could just choose a bunch of songs that I want to play, which I did do one week and it just didn't really work,"" Lightbody says. ""It just felt a little disconnected.""I miss playing live, I do. But it's going to be a long time, so this is what we've got.""With the communal thrill of congregating in the same room currently out of the question, Lightbody is among the artists to have come up with interesting ways to bring people together.When his Saturday Songwrite sessions have generated 10 or 12 decent tracks, he'll release an album for charity - although he hasn't settled on a charity yet. ""It might be best to put that to a vote as well.""Few musicians haven't done online performances, which can have an intimate charm (but can also be quite dull, beyond the voyeuristic kick of having a nosey in their houses).Lightbody recommends fellow Northern Irish singer Roe, who could teach the bigger names a thing or two about audio and video quality.This was filmed in isolation with Jay Dickson on the drums. We thought this would be a cool thing to do right now seeing...End of Facebook post  by ROESome performers get their fans involved - whether by taking requests or doing Q&As, virtual charity festivals or tutorials like Duran Duran star John Taylor with his bass masterclasses and Oti Mabuse with her dance lessons.Listening parties have also been a big hit. Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess has carved out a sideline as host of #timstwitterlisteningparty. Fans and musicians listen together in real time, tweeting their thoughts and memories.""There's power in listening and knowing others are doing so at the same as you,"" Burgess told The Sunday Times.In the US, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland - who staged a song-for-song producer clash in 2018 - now run a regular lockdown face-off, inviting different stars to go head-to-head in weekly Verzuz battles on Instagram.Erykah Badu and Jill Scott's recent battle was more of a love-in, and drew 700,000 live viewers.The New York Times has called Verzuz ""perhaps the most powerful quarantine-friendly entertainment franchise going"".Last night's #VERZUZ was special ✨ Thank you @fatbellybella and @missjillscott 🙏@Timbaland @THEREALSWIZZZ pic.twitter.com/8iOLySRompEnd of Twitter post  by @verzuzonlineBeyond music, lockdown may turn out to be a tipping point for activities like quizzes, choirs, and exercise, yoga and cookery lessons, which have found new leases of life online (despite the inevitable loss of the human touch).In theatre, as in music, it's hard to replicate the live experience on screen. But some are using technology to create a new kind of show.Although monologues have been filmed in lockdown and pre-recorded shows have been put online, they often can't capture the excitement of being in an audience. Plus, the magical, fantastical storytelling of theatre doesn't translate well to the screen.""What doesn't work is watching streaming of plays on computers,"" playwright Simon Stephens told BBC Radio 4's Front Row last week. ""Whenever I watch those I just feel lonelier than I felt before.""What is interesting is when writers, directors, actors and designers start thinking about - what are the dramatic potentials of Zoom?""In recent weeks, creative types have been exploring just that.David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman and Denise Gough starred in A Separate Peace, a one-act play by Sir Tom Stoppard on Zoom.""I'm fascinated by the format, which is a completely new kind of way of putting on a play where paradoxically you stay home and live theatre comes to you,"" Sir Tom said.The show tried to replicate something of the live experience, with audience members buying a ticket in advance and turning up at an allotted time - the performance deliberately wasn't put online to watch afterwards.It had professional crew, including video, lighting, costume and sound designers, and the actors (all at home, obviously) entered and exited their quarters of the screen as they would a stage. ""The cast were saying they were so nervous, like 'I really felt like I was standing in the wings,'"" says producer Matt Humphrey.""We want to show other people that this can be done and give confidence to other people that live theatre still has a place during lockdown."" And he believes such Zoom-style shows will still have a place when quarantine lifts.The Guardian's five-star review declared: ""If, for however long, this is live theatre's future, then it works triumphantly.""Another Zoom theatre triumph got the audience fully involved from their sofas.In a playful version of The Tempest from Northern Ireland-based theatre company Big Telly and Oxford's Creation Theatre, viewers were asked to help out by doing things like making storm sound effects and pretending to be a flock of birds. The most enthusiastic were spotlighted on screen for the rest of the audience to see.Another show, Operation Elsewhere, was originally ""an immersive theatre game"" played in the real world.  When the world locked down, it was hastily reworked for Zoom - also with lots of audience participation.""People turn all the lights off and get under blankets because we need cover of darkness,"" Big Telly artistic director Zoe Seaton explains. ""There was one point where a character says, 'If you've got war paint get it on now', and you see people rushing to the kitchen and getting ketchup and things.""End of Youtube post  by Big TellyVirtual backgrounds and green screens can create settings and effects that would be difficult and expensive in real life. ""I'm really enjoying it because it feels like a new box of tricks, a new way of telling stories,"" Seaton says.People have been tuning in from around the world and using the shows to have a shared night ""out"" with separated family members.""The joy of seeing your nephew and niece in Canada doing something in the same show that you're part of has just been amazing,"" Seaton says. ""We're interested in taking that further.""We work in rural communities in Ireland mostly, as well as Belfast and Derry, and suddenly our audience are in Brooklyn, and you think, oh gosh!""The key has been inviting the audience to bring the shows to life, Seaton adds. ""They have had that sense of community that theatre has, where you're all on the same journey. ""That's their main success. I think that's what people are missing in lockdown - that sense of community.""",18 May 2020,entertainment
The Night Watch: Will Gompertz reviews the Rijksmuseum's high tech photo ★★★★★,"At 9am on Tuesday the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam posted an image of Rembrandt's The Night Watch (1642) on its website. Nothing particularly unusual about that, you might think. After all, the museum frequently uploads pictures of its masterpieces from Dutch Golden Age. But there was something about this particular photo that made it stand out just like the little girl in a gold dress in Rembrandt's famous group portrait of local civic guardsmen. The web image presents the painting unframed on a dark grey background. It looks sharp and well-lit but not exceptional in terms of photography. Until, that is, you click on it, at which point you're zoomed in a bit closer. Click again and you're propelled towards the outstretched hand of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq. Another click, and you're face-to-face with the leader of this group of not-so-merry-men. Once more, and you can see the glint in his eye and the texture of his ginger beard. At no point does the image start to pixelate or distort, it's pin-sharp throughout. And it remains so as you continue to click, getting further and further into the painting until the Captain's paint-cracked eyeball is the size of a fist, and you realise that tiny glint you first saw isn't the result of one dab of Rembrandt's brush, but four separate applications, each loaded with a slightly different shade of paint. And then you stop and think: Crikey, Rembrandt actually used four different colours to paint a minuscule light effect in the eye of one of the many life-sized protagonists featured in this group portrait, which probably wouldn't be seen by anybody anyway. Or, maybe, this visionary 17th Century Dutchman foresaw a future where the early experiments with camera obscura techniques, in which he might have dabbled, would eventually lead to a photographic technology capable of recording a visual representation of his giant canvas to a level of detail beyond the eyesight of even the artist himself! It is, quite frankly, amazing.  For instance, I've always liked the ghostly dog that turns and snarls at the drummer situated at the edge of the painting. I'd assumed the hound was unfinished and therefore unloved by Rembrandt, but now I can see by zooming in that the artist not only gave the dog a stylish collar, but also added a gold pendant with a tiny flash of red paint to echo the colour of the trousers worn by the drummer. Clearly, Rembrandt was pro-dogs.As always there is artifice behind the art, as you will see within moments of zooming into The Night Watch. It quickly becomes apparent that Rembrandt first created his wonderfully dynamic composition, and then fine-tuned it as he went along. You will spot lots of small shadowy corrections (pentimenti) he made, such as the top of the drummer's stick on the far right, or on the index finger of the Ensign holding the Troop's flag aloft. There is artifice in the photograph, too. It is not a single image as it appears, but a composite of 528 individual digital photographs that have been seamlessly stitched together to give us a completely new view of one the most famous paintings in western art.Let's zoom out for a moment. Rembrandt signed, dated and called his painting:  Officers and Men of the Amsterdam Kloveniers Militia, the Company of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq.It was a commissioned portrait by the Kloveniers Militia (a sort of Dad's Army of locals) to hang in their HQ. Those featured (probably 18 members originally) each paid to be included. Capt Cocq takes centre stage, with his trusty Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch to his side. The men gathered behind them are carrying an assortment of weapons with which to defend their neighbourhood. Muskets (Klover) were their speciality, a point Rembrandt illustrates with a surreal sequence running left to right across the picture featuring three musketeers. The first, dressed in red with white collar and cuffs, is loading his musket with gunpowder. The second, a young boy, partially obscured by Cocq's right arm, fires his gun, ruffling the feathers of Ruytenburch's hat but not the man himself, who one has to assume is stone deaf. And then, there's the third, an older man also dressed in red, blowing away the spent powder from the fired gun. The young girl in the gold dress is not a member of the militia, but is there as their shining symbolic mascot. The upturned feet of the dead chicken hanging from her belt represent the Kloveniers' golden claw emblem. The painting initially hung with several other huge group portraits, giving visitors to the troops' inner sanctum the sense of being surrounded by local muscle. It was subsequently moved in 1715 to the Town Hall on the Dam (now the Royal Palace), where it was trimmed on all four sides to fit between the doors. It was first called The Night Watch in 1897, when the varnish applied to protect the paint had become so old and stained the picture looked like a nocturnal scene. That layer of varnish was removed long ago in one of the 25 or more restorations and treatments The Night Watch has undergone over the years. The most memorable being in 1975 after a visitor to the museum attacked the painting with a knife, causing severe damage, traces of which you can see when you zoom in on the new composite photograph: An act of art historical sleuthing which is the digital photo's primary purpose. The 44.8 Gigapixel image was created for the Rijksmuseum's conservation department, which is currently embarked upon the most exhaustive facelift The Night Watch has probably ever endured.  It enables the team of 12 to look right into the picture without using microscopes, in order to see what work needs to be done. A huge amount is the answer. Zoom in and you'll detect plenty of cracked paint, which is to be expected. But zero in on the Captain's and Lieutenant's faces and you will notice they're covered in blackheads. That's not because they didn't know one end of a bath from the other - they were sophisticated chaps - it is probably down to aging white paint particles, the tops of which have broken off to reveal a dark inner. There are thousands of these pinprick blemishes, all of which conservators should be able to reverse, bringing an even greater liveliness to an already lively painting. The Night Watch is an incredible work of art. Soon, you will be able to stand in front of it once again when the Rijksmuseum re-opens on the 1 June (caveat: there will be vastly reduced number of admissions, and The Night Watch is currently encased in a glass box - still visible but not as approachable).  And if and when you do see it for real, you will immediately notice Rembrandt's exaggerated use of light and shade to create a sense of drama, aided and abetted by an all-action composition emphasised by teaming diagonal lines. The Night Watch is as close to theatre as a painting can get. As the director of the Rijksmuseum said, it is a school photo taken before everybody is lined up in order (it shows Capt. Cocq instructing Lt. Ruytenburch to bring his men to attention). It captures a moment of movement and mayhem.You can see that when in front of the canvas. But when you are not, when you're at home, you can now see the same sense of chaos in the way Rembrandt painted his masterpiece, made when he was at the peak of his fame, just at the time his beloved wife was dying and his life took a turn for the worse. The further you look into it the greater the mess appears to be. Splodges of impasto paint here, unfinished transitions there. It's a mixture of early Rembrandt tautness and late Rembrandt looseness. If you thought Van Gogh or Jackson Pollock invented expressionistic painting, you'll think again when you've zoomed into The Night Watch. It is a sight to behold. A magnificent sight, which extends our knowledge of a truly great work of art, whether you're an old timer or a first timer. New technology is often used to try to jazz up old art, which is generally a bad idea. But, the Rijksmuseum is using technology to increase our understanding and appreciation of a Golden Age great, and that is a good idea. As you can see.

How some stars are helping music's unsung heroes in lockdown,"Whether they're guitar players, backing vocalists or studio engineers, career musicians struggle with pay even in regular times. Many take on extra work to make ends meet when their services aren't needed on stage or in the studio.For them, the Covid-19 pandemic has been a double whammy. Not only have tours and recording sessions been put on hold, but those second jobs in wedding bands or school classrooms have vanished, too.According to a Musicians Union survey, 92% of its members have seen their livelihood affected by coronavirus, losing an estimated £13.9m in earnings in the first two weeks of the lockdown.Meanwhile, the Ivors Academy of songwriters and composers said it anticipated a loss of £25,000 per member over a six-month period.The figures may come as a surprise, given recent headlines about record-breaking royalty payments and Rihanna's £468m fortune, but the wealth in the music industry tends to accumulate at the top.For the rest, the ""industry has ground to a halt,"" says Olga FitzRoy, an award-winning engineer and producer whose credits include Coldplay, Foo Fighters and The Beatles.""I did my last session in the first week of March and I've had nothing since then, and my colleagues are pretty much in the same boat,"" she tells the BBC. ""There's no money coming in"".In the midst of the pandemic, however, some artists are finding ways to support their sidemen and women - and hoping they can establish new precedents along the way.In Paris, jazz artist Melody Gardot is making a new record from her apartment, and inviting musicians from around the world to form her ""virtual orchestra"".Anyone can sign up - and they'll receive musical charts, backing tracks and instructions with on how to record themselves performing at home.Crucially, however, she is paying standard union rates to anyone who appears on the finished record. ""The reality is I can't do what I do without those musicians,"" the Grammy nominee tells the BBC.""If I stand on stage by myself, it's way less interesting than if I have a beautiful array of colours to offer. So these people are equally important and we can't forget about them during this time."" I want to contribute something unique to this new movement of ‘connection despite distance’. During this complicated time, we miss essential connections with one other.  We miss hugs, we miss our family, our friends......in short we miss love. So I want to make a love project to help break the feeling of isolation between us. Join me in the first step of this new project “From Paris with Love” by submitting the following: 1. Film a 5 second “video-portrait”, of yourself.  Film it HORIZONTALLY, and make sure we can see enough of you (chest to head) and with a fixed camera (it’s like taking a picture but 5 seconds long and in video format). Dont move too much :) Just pose and record with some natural light in front of a *NEUTRAL BACKGROUND* wearing *SOLID BLACK OR WHITE* tee shirt only please. 2. HANDWRITTEN horizontally, using a large black sharpie or black crayon on a white piece of paper (standard A4 format suggested) say “From (wherever you are) With Love”. Scan or photograph the paper (highest quality possible) and send ! 3. SEND both items (your photo scan and your video) to the email address : frompariswithloveproject@gmail.com **In your email please include your Instagram handle (if you have one) so we can find you later. After receiving these things, we’ll put together a surprising collaborative video clip featuring all your submissions alongside a new piece of music called “From Paris with Love”. A large portion my royalties from this song will be donated to a Covid relief charity to help medical workers during this time. This way, we share as much love as we possibly can together. **Please remember if you send this along it means you’re okay for me to for use your image in this project, so think about breaking the ‘quarantine pijama’ uniform if you don’t want everybody to see you that way ! Your mom and mine will see this ;) Full T&Cs here https://decca.lnk.to/termsandconditions We’re only collecting these over the next few days - so please don’t wait too long. Feel free to pass this message along. This is just the first step of this collaborative journey so stay tuned..... ❤️ With love, from Paris Frompariswithloveproject@gmail.comA post shared by  Melody Gardot (@melodygardotofficial) on Apr 29, 2020 at 8:31am PDTEnd of Instagram post  by melodygardotofficialSo far, Gardot has received submissions from players in ""Croatia, Santa Monica, France and England,"" ranging from top-level professionals to ""an 11-year-old girl who really wants to be a musician"".Her song, With Love From Paris, is a sumptuous, melancholy ballad whose refrain - ""maybe one day I will see you soon"" - pre-dates the lockdown, but has taken on added resonance over the last eight weeks.She decided to ask out-of-work musicians to complete the track after recalling the long weekends she would spend playing piano bars in Philadelphia as a teenager.""I remember playing gigs for food, just to get dinner,"" she remembers. "" Then it got a little better and I do the gig to get 25 bucks and then 50. I was hustling, you know? And I know musicians are in that place right now. ""They don't know how they're going to get by, they need to put some bread on the table, and all of a sudden, not only can they contribute [to this song], doing something they love, but at the end of the day, there's a pay check coming in.""Gardot isn't the only artist leveraging her influence to help others. Pop star Charli XCX has spent the last six weeks recording a new album from scratch in her house - partly to keep herself sane, but also because she realised her regular collaborators would be struggling to make ends meet.""There are a lot of other creative people who can't work during this time,"" she told the BBC last month. ""So, for me, doing this project is also a way to support some of those people, whether that be video editors, or the painters who are doing my artwork, or 3D designers, or video directors.""Indie band The National are donating all profits from their merchandise store to their road crew; while Good Charlotte's Joel and Benji Madden have re-tooled their e-commerce site Veeps to help other bands raise money.The site, which started out as a way to market VIP packages for concert tours, now allows artists to sell tickets to streaming online gigs. So far, it's been embraced by musicians like Angel Olsen, Bat For Lashes and All Time Low, who've used the income to support their touring crew, raise money for charity or offset lost earnings.Typically, the artists are those who can't afford to stage pro-bono live-streams on Instagram - or who are wary of Facebook and Spotify's ""tipping"" systems, which can both produce varying results.All of these ideas are all still taking shape, but they're going to prove crucial if the industry is to survive.Gardot says she hopes other artists will follow her lead in paying musicians for recording their parts at home.""We got to get some of the big cats on board, like John Mayer or Ed Sheeran, and keep creating opportunities for other people,"" she says.That could be crucial, says FitzRoy, as it could be a long time before things return to normal. Although recording studios could re-open in June, with an initial backlog of work to get through, the picture is a little less rosy further down the line.""There's no live work, so a lot of artists won't have had any income, so they won't be able to afford to make records,"" she says. ""And the fact that film production has ground to a halt means that, in six months' time, those projects that should have been recording scores at the big studios just won't be happening.""So there'll be a little bump of activity when things resume, but the longer-term effects are going to be with us for the next couple of years.""Echoing calls made by UK Music earlier this week, FitzRoy says the government should work closely with the industry to make sure it survives as the UK emerges from lockdown.""The music industry makes a lot of money for them in the good times,"" she says. ""They need to think about that.""",14 May 2020,entertainment
Ruby Rose leaves Batwoman - and other stars who exited major roles,"The Australian actress Ruby Rose is to leave her role as comic book superhero Batwoman after just one series.Rose said it had been a ""very difficult decision"" not to return to the show, which is shown in the UK on E4.Batwoman, which began on the CW network last year, is the first superhero show to have an openly gay lead character.Its producers said they were ""firmly committed"" to the show's ""long-term"" future and would re-cast the role with another member of the LGBTQ community.Rose, who is openly gay, said she was ""truly grateful... to everyone who made season one a success"". The 34-year-old said she had ""the utmost respect"" for everyone involved and that the decision to leave had not been ""made lightly"".Rose faced a backlash on social media when she was cast as Batwoman, with some saying the role should have gone to a lesbian actress.The actress, who has called herself ""gender-fluid"" in interviews, later deleted her Twitter profile, though she remains active on Instagram.Last year Rose revealed she had suffered an injury while filming the series that had required her to undergo emergency surgery.The actress said she had ""herniated two discs doing stunts"" - but Deadline reported the injury was not the reason for her departure.Born in Melbourne in 1986, Rose played Stella Carlin in Orange is the New Black and has appeared in such films as Pitch Perfect 3 and The Meg.Yet she is far from the first actor to leave or be replaced in a major film or TV show.George Lazenby famously walked away from the role of James Bond after making just one appearance in the popular spy film series.The model turned actor later admitted he had been persuaded by his then-manager - the late Ronan O'Rahilly - to seek other opportunities.""I thought he knew what he was talking about so I listened to him,"" the Australian told an audience at the National Film Theatre last year.Lazenby's single outing as Bond, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was released in 1969 and is now a firm fan favourite.Christopher Eccleston was cast as The Doctor when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 - but he departed after a single series.The actor, who was replaced by David Tennant, later said he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture"" of the show.""My relationship with my three immediate superiors... broke down irreparably during the first block of filming and it never recovered,"" he elaborated in 2018.The actor, currently to be seen in The A Word on BBC One, also said he had been ""out of his comfort zone"" playing the sci-fi drama's time-travelling hero.Edward Norton was cast as Bruce Banner in 2008's The Incredible Hulk but did not reprise the role in Marvel Studios' subsequent comic-book blockbusters.Its president Kevin Feige later said the role had been recast out of a ""need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members"".Speaking last year, Norton called Feige's 2010 statement ""cheap"" and that his exit had been the result of differing views on how to depict the character.""Ultimately they weren't going for long, dark and serious,"" said Norton, who was replaced by Mark Ruffalo when The Hulk returned in 2012's Avengers Assemble.Terrence Howard, who played James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in 2008's Iron Man, is another actor to be replaced in Marvel's superhero film series.He later claimed he was offered less money than he had been promised to reprise the role, which Don Cheadle has played since 2010's Iron Man 2.Sharon Gless played Christine Cagney in Cagney and Lacey for seven years, winning two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for her pains.Yet she was not the first actress to play the part in the popular US TV series about two female police detectives solving crimes in New York City.Loretta Swit played Cagney in the original TV movie but was not able to continue in the role when the CBS show went to series.Meg Foster was then cast, only to be replaced after six episodes because CBS allegedly wanted someone ""more feminine"" in the role.Speaking in 2012, Gless praised her co-star Tyne Daly for ""welcoming me as if she had not had anybody before me"".""I know her heart was hurting because she loved her last Cagney,"" she revealed.When Men Behaving Badly first began in 1992, the two flatmates were played by Martin Clunes and Harry Enfield.According to Clunes, though, the show that ITV produced did not match Enfield's hopes for it.""His original vision was for it not to be like a usual sitcom,"" Clunes told The Guardian in 2013. ""Then we made the pilot and it shocked him.""You could see Harry wanted out,"" he continued. ""He was under contract, though, so had to do one series.""Neil Morrissey was subsequently cast as Clunes' flatmate in the show, which continued on ITV for another series before being picked up by the BBC.",20 May 2020,entertainment
Joe Rogan signs with Spotify in major and exclusive podcast deal,"Joe Rogan has signed an exclusive deal with Spotify, which will see his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, disappear from all other platforms.The multi-year deal is believed to be worth $100m (£82 million), according to the Wall Street Journal.Rogan's podcast, which is one of the most popular in the world, will arrive on the streaming giant on 1 September.It will then be housed there exclusively by the end of the year, and removed from all other platforms.""It will remain free, and it will be the exact same show,"" said Rogan. ""It's just a licensing deal, so Spotify won't have any creative control over the show.""They want me to just continue doing it the way I'm doing it right now.""I'm excited to have the support of the largest audio platform in the world and I hope you folks are there when we make the switch!""Joe Rogan is a US stand-up comedian and TV host-turned-provocateur, who launched his podcast in 2009 - in the early days of the medium.He invites a wide range of guests, including actors, musicians, comedians, politicians and conspiracy theorists on to the show, which has garnered a huge audience. Last year the podcast was downloaded 190 million times per month.Rogan has previously advocated for ""long-form media"" - and his own podcast episodes regularly run to two or three hours.The controversial entertainer also has 8.42 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, which has up until now shown the interviews in video form (this will stop when the new Spotify deal kicks in).But he has also attracted criticism - Rogan has been accused of making sexist, racist and transphobic comments in his podcasts.""The Joe Rogan Experience has become one of the internet's foremost vectors for anti-wokeness,"" wrote Justin Peters in Slate.In 2018, Rogan's show hit the headlines when the host shared a cannabis joint with Tesla boss Elon Musk, after which the company's stocks fell by 9%.Rogan has been credited as being an ""unlikely political influencer"" by the New York Times, due to his reach. In January, he informed his legions of followers that he would ""probably vote for Bernie"", referring to the then Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders, who received increased press coverage as a result.However, since Joe Biden became the party's presumptive nominee, Rogan has said he is more likely to vote for President Trump.The kind of figures involved in the deal are incredibly rare in the podcast world - and Rogan will now likely earn more money than most musicians on Spotify.""Joe Rogan just got paid the equivalent value of over 26 billion streams for a podcast licence,"" wrote Tom Gray, director of the royalties, music copyright and licensing society, PRS for Music.""A musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights."" added music writer Ted Gioia.Gioia suggested this means ""Spotify values Rogan more than any musician in the history of the world"".TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan predicted the deal could ""lead the way to others"", but noted that the exclusivity clause would leave many fans locked out.""It might do what Sky did for a lot of shows,"" he tweeted. ""Lift them up, but put them behind a wall that the culture mostly then ignores.""Although Rogan has said the podcast will still be free to access, Spotify will be hoping the increased traffic to its service will lead to a significant increase in subscriber numbers.It is generally difficult to make large amounts of money in the crowded world of podcasts. As most podcasts are free to download, many presenters and producers attempt to make money from endorsements and advertising. A platform-exclusive deal such as this is very rare.
