King of Staten Island: 'There's comedy in the most difficult situations',"Filmmaker Judd Apatow has never been afraid to poke fun at serious subjects.In Knocked-Up he found the humour in an unwanted pregnancy from a one-night stand. In This is 40 he made us laugh about a couple going through a midlife crisis. And in 40-year-old Virgin he addressed... well, you know.For his latest project, The King of Staten Island, the director has joined forces with US comedy star Pete Davidson to tell the tale of the effects of the latter's own personal 9/11 tragedy.Aged seven, Davidson lost his father Scott, who died while working as a fire fighter helping to deal with the aftermath of the plane attacks on New York City in 2001. His dad was one of 2,977 people to lose their lives.""I always think that there's comedy in the most difficult situations,"" says Apatow, across a three-way virtual film junket.""That's why we like Dr Strangelove [Stanley Kubrik and Peter Sellers' dark comedy about nuclear war]. You can't have a more difficult situation than that. So that's the lens that I've always seen everything through.""I think as a kid, I felt a lot of hostility, I didn't feel like the world was fair. But I loved comedy films and comedians and I loved that they mocked how the world worked, and they helped me try to figure it out.""So I don't think anything is off limits, if your heart is in the right place you really can explore anything.""In the film, Davidson plays a ""75% true"" version of himself - a directionless grief-stricken 20-something stoner named Scott, who has behavioural issues, and lives with his mum and sister in the least fashionable of the five boroughs.He agrees it's all a rich vein of material.""I had similar experiences growing up as Judd, where I didn't think the world was fair and I had people like Adam Sandler and Jim Carey and Eddie Murphy and Bill Burr to point those things out to me and make it humorous,"" he says.Burr, as it happens, was able to help out Davidson directly, by playing the new love interest for Scott's widowed mother Margie; played by Marisa Tomei. As if having a new man in the house isn't problematic enough, Burr's character Ray just happens to be another fireman, and of course, comedy ensues.What initially began as ""90 pages of toilet humour,"" written by Davidson and his writing buddy Dave Cyrus, was, with Apatow's help, turned into a ""beautiful script"", full of ""emotion and range"".As well as being a ""love letter"" to his mum, Davidson, who also has an executive producer credit, hopes the feature will allow him to draw a line under many of the mental health issues that have plagued him, very publicly, for years.In December 2018, the police checked in on the at-times controversial SNL breakout stand-up star after he alarmed fans by posting on social media that he didn't ""want to be on this earth anymore"", not long after his high-profile breakup from ex-fiance Ariana Grande.""I had a lot of prior issues and a lot of stuff that I was dealing with personally that I wanted to bring to the forefront so that I could not only make a movie but also just grow as a person,"" says Davidson, who has borderline personality disorder, as well as Crohn's Disease.""What I wanted to do was maybe after we did this I could put that part of my life behind me and, not forget it, but move forward and have a new outlook on life.""Apatow believes the lead character, who daydreams about one day running a tattoo restaurant, is a fair reflection of what Pete's life might be like now if he hadn't found his comedy calling.The pair first worked together on another Apatow film - 2015's Trainwreck, and he describes Davidson as ""a funny, great, fascinating person"".That particular film gave another comic actor and writer, Amy Schumer, her big movie break, and other stars including Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and Kristen Wiig have all benefitted similarly from his direction early on.Now, with no cinematic release, due to the Covid-19 virus shutting theatres, and against the backdrop of mass Black Lives Matter protests, following the death of George Floyd, Davidson admits it's ""an odd time to put something out"".""It's nice to put something positive into the world, so I hope people enjoy it,"" he says.Making movies, Apatow stresses, is ""one of the hardest professions to make safe"", as they are ""all about being close to each other, touching each other, and being in very small spaces"".The director also hopes the protests, for people who ""were ignored for a very long time"" ultimately ""lead to meaningful change,"" and he urges people to vote for it in the US elections in November.""I just hope that people are kinder to each other in the future,"" adds Davidson.The thing they both miss most about the old pre-coronavirus world is the ability to simply hang out with friends at comedy clubs, where Apatow also began his career, as a stand-up. The 52-year-old jokes they'll both mark their film's online release by simultaneously pressing play on iPads from their own respective beds!The King of Staten Island is a film about trauma, loss, and the healing qualities of opening your heart again to love and laughter.What might Davidson's dad have made of it?""I think if my dad was around he would get a kick out of it,"" says the leading man. ""He would be like, 'holy crap, dude, that's crazy!'""My dad was a huge comedy fan, so I think he would just be thrilled"".As well as being there in spirit, the real Scott is made flesh on-screen not only by his son, but also by his own father Stephen, who makes a scene-stealing cameo as Grandpa. Apatow says: ""The truth is Pete, we never talked about it... your grandfather actually would get called, you can see him as a regular on Seinfeld. He actually could have been that guy"".""Oh yeah, he'll get some work out of this,"" nods his rather more famous grandson. For now, at least.The King of Staten Island is out now on various platforms now",12 June 2020,entertainment
Pete Davidson speaks out for first time on Ariana split,"Pete Davidson has spoken out for the first time since his split with Ariana Grande.The 24-year-old SNL comedian jokingly asked if there was ""anybody looking for a roommate?"" at a benefit gig.He was doing stand-up alongside Judd Apatow at a benefit gig for the Democrats in LA.This is the first time Davidson has publicly acknowledged his split from the singer.The pair first got together in May and became engaged shortly after.They moved into 25-year-old Ariana's apartment in New York and spent most of the summer together, but it was not meant to be.US sources reported last week that the pair had agreed ""it was not the right time for their relationship to take off"". Davidson's stand up set followed on from Judd Apatow at the event, joking ""who wants to follow that?"".He added: ""Am I not going through enough that I have to follow that?!""He then made some more jokes about the break up, commenting: ""Well, as you can tell, I don't want to be here. There's a lot going on. Anybody have any open rooms? Anybody looking for a roommate?""Whilst Davidson didn't address what had happened to Ariana's engagement ring or the pair's pet pig, Piggie Smalls, he did joke about all the tattoos he got during his five month relationship.""I've been covering a bunch of tattoos, that's fun. I'm 0-for-2 in the tattoo department,"" he joked. ""Yeah, I'm afraid to get my mom tattooed on me because she'd leave"". ",22 October 2018,entertainment
"This is 40, according to Judd Apatow","Producer, writer and director Judd Apatow, described as Hollywood's current king of comedy, hired his entire immediate family for his latest film, This Is 40.Many, if not most, people would shy away from bringing their kids to work.

Paul Rudd and Mann reprise their roles as Pete and Debbie, who were supporting characters in the first film. This time, their marriage takes centre stage as they approach their 40th birthdays.Debbie is juggling family life with running a business, where one of her employees is suspected of stealing from her. Meanwhile, she is attempting to build bridges with her father, her husband's record label is failing, and there are a number of convincing clashes with her real-life, and on-screen, eldest daughter.So, was it stressful to play out all of those issues as a family?""My kids are funny and we all get along,"" says Apatow. ""We're a big gang and we like each other so for them it's just play.""They don't feel any stress about work because they're not actually trying to be actresses.

""When they look at each other, you can tell they're really mad at each other and they believe the positions they are stating when they fight in the movie.""But the film has been a form of family therapy.""Making the movie has made my kids understand each other more and they've gotten along a lot better as a result of having to play out all of these issues on film.""The director says about a third of the scenes are based on experience - but his wife maintains there are big differences between their home life and the story.""Some of it is inspired by things that we have gone through as a married couple or as parents, but by the time it winds up on film it is something completely different,"" says Mann.The actress doesn't get a writing credit on the movie, but Apatow says she was deeply involved in the writing.""I'll tell her my idea for the movie and some scene ideas and then she'll pitch me ideas,"" he says.""She's not afraid to be vulnerable.

Lady Antebellum: US band change name to Lady A over slave-era links,"Chart-topping US pop group Lady Antebellum have changed their name to Lady A because Antebellum has connotations with the slavery era.The Nashville trio have won five Grammys and had seven US top 10 albums, including three number ones.The word antebellum is used to refer to the period and architecture in the US South before the Civil War.They say they took the name from the architectural style, but are ""deeply sorry for the hurt this has caused"".In a statement on Twitter, they said their eyes had been opened to ""the injustices, inequality and biases black women and men have always faced"" and ""blindspots we didn't even know existed"".They originally took their name from the antebellum style of home after taking their first band photos in front of one such house almost 14 years ago, they said.""As musicians, it reminded us of all the music born in the South that influenced us,"" they wrote.""But we are regretful and embarrassed to say that we did not take into account the associations that weigh down this word referring to the period of history before the Civil War, which includes slavery.""We are deeply sorry for the hurt this has caused and for anyone who has felt unsafe, unseen or unvalued.

Stormzy pledges £10m over 10 years to fighting racial inequality,"Stormzy has pledged £10 million to UK organisations, charities and movements tackling racial inequality, justice reform and black empowerment.The grime star said he will make his donation over the next 10 years.""We have to fight against the odds of a racist system stacked against us and designed for us to fail from before we are even born,"" he said.He has also funded black British students at Cambridge University.Stormzy said he was making his £10m donation to fight racial inequality because ""the uncomfortable truth that our country continuously fails to recognise and admit, is that black people in the UK have been at a constant disadvantage in every aspect of life - simply due to the colour of our skin.""I'm lucky enough to be in the position I'm in and I've heard people often dismiss the idea of racism existing in Britain by saying 'If the country's so racist how have you become a success?!' and I reject that with this: I am not the UK's shining example of what supposedly happens when a black person works hard.""There are millions of us. We are not far and few. We have to fight against the odds of a racist system stacked against us and designed for us to fail from before we are even born.""Black people have been playing on an uneven field for far too long and this pledge is a continuation in the fight to finally try and even it.""

King of Staten Island: 'There's comedy in the most difficult situations',"Filmmaker Judd Apatow has never been afraid to poke fun at serious subjects.In Knocked-Up he found the humour in an unwanted pregnancy from a one-night stand. In This is 40 he made us laugh about a couple going through a midlife crisis. And in 40-year-old Virgin he addressed... well, you know.For his latest project, The King of Staten Island, the director has joined forces with US comedy star Pete Davidson to tell the tale of the effects of the latter's own personal 9/11 tragedy.Aged seven, Davidson lost his father Scott, who died while working as a fire fighter helping to deal with the aftermath of the plane attacks on New York City in 2001. His dad was one of 2,977 people to lose their lives.""I always think that there's comedy in the most difficult situations,"" says Apatow, across a three-way virtual film junket.""That's why we like Dr Strangelove [Stanley Kubrik and Peter Sellers' dark comedy about nuclear war]. You can't have a more difficult situation than that. So that's the lens that I've always seen everything through.""I think as a kid, I felt a lot of hostility, I didn't feel like the world was fair. But I loved comedy films and comedians and I loved that they mocked how the world worked, and they helped me try to figure it out.""So I don't think anything is off limits, if your heart is in the right place you really can explore anything.""In the film, Davidson plays a ""75% true"" version of himself - a directionless grief-stricken 20-something stoner named Scott, who has behavioural issues, and lives with his mum and sister in the least fashionable of the five boroughs.He agrees it's all a rich vein of material.""I had similar experiences growing up as Judd, where I didn't think the world was fair and I had people like Adam Sandler and Jim Carey and Eddie Murphy and Bill Burr to point those things out to me and make it humorous,"" he says.Burr, as it happens, was able to help out Davidson directly, by playing the new love interest for Scott's widowed mother Margie; played by Marisa Tomei. As if having a new man in the house isn't problematic enough, Burr's character Ray just happens to be another fireman, and of course, comedy ensues.What initially began as ""90 pages of toilet humour,"" written by Davidson and his writing buddy Dave Cyrus, was, with Apatow's help, turned into a ""beautiful script"", full of ""emotion and range"".As well as being a ""love letter"" to his mum, Davidson, who also has an executive producer credit, hopes the feature will allow him to draw a line under many of the mental health issues that have plagued him, very publicly, for years.In December 2018, the police checked in on the at-times controversial SNL breakout stand-up star after he alarmed fans by posting on social media that he didn't ""want to be on this earth anymore"", not long after his high-profile breakup from ex-fiance Ariana Grande.""I had a lot of prior issues and a lot of stuff that I was dealing with personally that I wanted to bring to the forefront so that I could not only make a movie but also just grow as a person,"" says Davidson, who has borderline personality disorder, as well as Crohn's Disease.""What I wanted to do was maybe after we did this I could put that part of my life behind me and, not forget it, but move forward and have a new outlook on life.""Apatow believes the lead character, who daydreams about one day running a tattoo restaurant, is a fair reflection of what Pete's life might be like now if he hadn't found his comedy calling.The pair first worked together on another Apatow film - 2015's Trainwreck, and he describes Davidson as ""a funny, great, fascinating person"".That particular film gave another comic actor and writer, Amy Schumer, her big movie break, and other stars including Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and Kristen Wiig have all benefitted similarly from his direction early on.Now, with no cinematic release, due to the Covid-19 virus shutting theatres, and against the backdrop of mass Black Lives Matter protests, following the death of George Floyd, Davidson admits it's ""an odd time to put something out"".""It's nice to put something positive into the world, so I hope people enjoy it,"" he says.Making movies, Apatow stresses, is ""one of the hardest professions to make safe"", as they are ""all about being close to each other, touching each other, and being in very small spaces"".The director also hopes the protests, for people who ""were ignored for a very long time"" ultimately ""lead to meaningful change,"" and he urges people to vote for it in the US elections in November.""I just hope that people are kinder to each other in the future,"" adds Davidson.The thing they both miss most about the old pre-coronavirus world is the ability to simply hang out with friends at comedy clubs, where Apatow also began his career, as a stand-up. The 52-year-old jokes they'll both mark their film's online release by simultaneously pressing play on iPads from their own respective beds!The King of Staten Island is a film about trauma, loss, and the healing qualities of opening your heart again to love and laughter.What might Davidson's dad have made of it?""I think if my dad was around he would get a kick out of it,"" says the leading man. ""He would be like, 'holy crap, dude, that's crazy!'""My dad was a huge comedy fan, so I think he would just be thrilled"".As well as being there in spirit, the real Scott is made flesh on-screen not only by his son, but also by his own father Stephen, who makes a scene-stealing cameo as Grandpa. Apatow says: ""The truth is Pete, we never talked about it... your grandfather actually would get called, you can see him as a regular on Seinfeld. He actually could have been that guy"".""Oh yeah, he'll get some work out of this,"" nods his rather more famous grandson. For now, at least.The King of Staten Island is out now on various platforms now",12 June 2020,entertainment

Meanwhile, she is attempting to build bridges with her father, her husband's record label is failing, and there are a number of convincing clashes with her real-life, and on-screen, eldest daughter.So, was it stressful to play out all of those issues as a family?""My kids are funny and we all get along,"" says Apatow.

Lady Antebellum: US band change name to Lady A over slave-era links,"Chart-topping US pop group Lady Antebellum have changed their name to Lady A because Antebellum has connotations with the slavery era.The Nashville trio have won five Grammys and had seven US top 10 albums, including three number ones.The word antebellum is used to refer to the period and architecture in the US South before the Civil War.They say they took the name from the architectural style, but are ""deeply sorry for the hurt this has caused"".In a statement on Twitter, they said their eyes had been opened to ""the injustices, inequality and biases black women and men have always faced"" and ""blindspots we didn't even know existed"".They originally took their name from the antebellum style of home after taking their first band photos in front of one such house almost 14 years ago, they said.""As musicians, it reminded us of all the music born in the South that influenced us,"" they wrote.""But we are regretful and embarrassed to say that we did not take into account the associations that weigh down this word referring to the period of history before the Civil War, which includes slavery.""We are deeply sorry for the hurt this has caused and for anyone who has felt unsafe, unseen or unvalued. Causing pain was never our hearts' intention, but it doesn't change the fact that indeed, it did just that."" The group are best known for their hit Need You Now, which reached number two in the US, and the top 20 in the UK, in 2010.They said they made the decision after ""personal reflection, band discussion, prayer and many honest conversations with some of our closest black friends and colleagues"".They added: ""We can make no excuse for our lateness to this realisation. What we can do is acknowledge it, turn from it and take action.""Their move comes after British record label One Little Indian, which has released music by Bjork, Sigur Ros and Paul McCartney's side-project The Fireman, changed its name to One Little Independent.Founder Derek Birkett said he'd made the decision after a fan explained why the name - which uses an outdated term for the indigenous people of the Americas - was ""offensive"".""The last few weeks have been a monumental learning curve,"" he wrote in a statement. ""Following the receipt of an eye-opening letter from a Crass fan that detailed precisely why the logo and label name are offensive, as well as the violent history of the terminology, I felt equally appalled and grateful to them for making me understand what must be changed.""He went on to explain that the label had been founded in the late 1970s, when his friends were inspired by the ""philosophies of the Indigenous People of the Americas"".""I was naive enough at the time of founding my label to think that the name and logo was reflective of my respect and appreciation of the culture,"" he said. ""I recognise now that both contribute to racism and should have been addressed a long, long time ago.""The name changes come as the music industry seeks to address its complicated history with race, in the wake of George Floyd's death and Black Lives Matter protests around the world.The term ""urban music"" has been scrapped by Republic Records, which is home to Drake and Ariana Grande, while the Grammys have announced they will stop using ""urban"" to describe music of black origin in their awards categories.",11 June 2020,entertainment

Coronavirus: Cinemas around world ponder reopening strategy,"Tens of thousands of cinemas around the world were forced to close by Covid-19. Some are reopening in certain countries and the industry is banking on big summer releases to attract filmgoers back. But will customers feel safe stepping through the doors? The original trailer for Christopher Nolan's $200m fantasy spy epic Tenet ended with a release date of 17 July. The most recent trailer dumps the date totally.It's now uncertain when Tenet will come out - like much else in the film world.It's a Warner Bros release, but even competitors - as well as the big cinema chains - are hoping Tenet will mark the moment when audiences start buying cinema tickets again. In March virtually all cinemas worldwide closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Sweden, Taiwan and South Korea were partial exceptions. In recent weeks other countries have announced that cinemas can start to reopen. Yet Louise Tutt of Screen International magazine says the situation on the ground is complex.""What most of the cinemas are showing is a strange mixture,"" she says. ""Partly it's films they were showing pre-lockdown and a few library titles.""For instance, in South Korea they've re-released The Greatest Showman and cinemas in parts of Germany are beginning to show new local comedies.""But social distancing and a lack of new films means very little money is being taken. A European country or a US state may lift lockdown, but in most places admissions are a fraction of what they should be.""Cinemas in Denmark and Croatia were among those that reopened last month. Italian cinemas are about to open with an audience limit of 200, or 1,000 for outdoor screenings.Plans in the UK are still under discussion, but cinemas in England could potentially reopen from 4 July.Finnish cinemas were allowed to open at the start of this month. But Tero Koistinen of the Finnish Chamber of Films says only about 10% of the country's 350 screens are in operation.""The cinemas which did reopen mainly were single-screen independents and a few arthouse venues screening titles like Parasite and Emma,"" he says.""But the volume market simply isn't there yet, whatever is permitted in theory.""Koistinen says it's impossible to exaggerate the importance of Tenet. ""It's not only that Finns want to see the new Christopher Nolan movie, although I think they do. But Tenet has become the great symbol of the return of Hollywood movies. ""Finns really enjoy local titles on screen. But commercial cinema basically means Hollywood, and until Tenet and a couple of other big films are released our attendances will be quite low.""We will have to see how social distancing develops. It may be that multiplexes will play Tenet across several screens but always to a limited audience.""Louise Tutt says Warner Bros are having discussions daily on when to release Tenet around the world. ""The cold commercial fact is they need around 80% of screens open. And they can't release it in the US unless the main film-going hubs like New York and Los Angeles are open for business - the places worst hit by Covid-19. ""I don't think they can release it in Asia and Europe until America is watching too. The story has been kept pretty shrouded and they don't want secrets given away before everyone can see it. So a 17 July release is starting to look like a big ask and there's a back-up date which would probably be 14 August.""It's highly problematic for Warners, but one good thing is that Christopher Nolan is an evangelist for the cinematic experience and he will be good at talking that up. But marketing is all over the place this year, if only because no one is seeing trailers on the big screen.""Tutt says other big summer releases will also play their part in persuading audiences to return. They include another Warner release, Wonder Woman 1984 and Disney's Mulan, a live-action version of its 1998 animation.Both films are more female-focused than Tenet. But Tutt thinks the big unknown is whether audience behaviour will have changed. ""No one can say how willing or not people will be to go into a cinema and sit there for two hours."" she explains. ""But we saw when the beaches and parks opened up that people dashed there, because they were desperate to get out of the house and feel some kind of normality returning. ""One thing in cinema's favour is that films like Mulan and Tenet have a built-in appeal to young audiences. Anecdotally they appear the people least anxious about going out into the world.""Like Tero Koistinen, Tutt thinks multiplexes may work in a very different way for the remainder of 2020. ""Perhaps something like Tenet or Mulan will stay on screen for a long time because individual audiences will be limited in size. So a film will still be seen by everyone who wants to see it, but it will take longer to happen.""I do think people are desperate to go out and have a communal experience.""Before we get there, though,  audiences will need to feel comfortable going to a cinema again. ""In the US and the UK there are huge promotional campaigns being finalised to persuade us back,"" says Tutt. ""That's one half of the battle.""The other is having great films out there that audiences really want to see..""Tenet is currently scheduled for UK release on 17 July, while Mulan is scheduled for a 24 July release.",11 June 2020,entertainment
King of Staten Island: 'There's comedy in the most difficult situations',"Filmmaker Judd Apatow has never been afraid to poke fun at serious subjects.In Knocked-Up he found the humour in an unwanted pregnancy from a one-night stand. In This is 40 he made us laugh about a couple going through a midlife crisis. And in 40-year-old Virgin he addressed... well, you know.For his latest project, The King of Staten Island, the director has joined forces with US comedy star Pete Davidson to tell the tale of the effects of the latter's own personal 9/11 tragedy.Aged seven, Davidson lost his father Scott, who died while working as a fire fighter helping to deal with the aftermath of the plane attacks on New York City in 2001. His dad was one of 2,977 people to lose their lives.""I always think that there's comedy in the most difficult situations,"" says Apatow, across a three-way virtual film junket.""That's why we like Dr Strangelove [Stanley Kubrik and Peter Sellers' dark comedy about nuclear war]. You can't have a more difficult situation than that. So that's the lens that I've always seen everything through.""I think as a kid, I felt a lot of hostility, I didn't feel like the world was fair. But I loved comedy films and comedians and I loved that they mocked how the world worked, and they helped me try to figure it out.""So I don't think anything is off limits, if your heart is in the right place you really can explore anything.""In the film, Davidson plays a ""75% true"" version of himself - a directionless grief-stricken 20-something stoner named Scott, who has behavioural issues, and lives with his mum and sister in the least fashionable of the five boroughs.He agrees it's all a rich vein of material.""I had similar experiences growing up as Judd, where I didn't think the world was fair and I had people like Adam Sandler and Jim Carey and Eddie Murphy and Bill Burr to point those things out to me and make it humorous,"" he says.Burr, as it happens, was able to help out Davidson directly, by playing the new love interest for Scott's widowed mother Margie; played by Marisa Tomei. As if having a new man in the house isn't problematic enough, Burr's character Ray just happens to be another fireman, and of course, comedy ensues.What initially began as ""90 pages of toilet humour,"" written by Davidson and his writing buddy Dave Cyrus, was, with Apatow's help, turned into a ""beautiful script"", full of ""emotion and range"".As well as being a ""love letter"" to his mum, Davidson, who also has an executive producer credit, hopes the feature will allow him to draw a line under many of the mental health issues that have plagued him, very publicly, for years.In December 2018, the police checked in on the at-times controversial SNL breakout stand-up star after he alarmed fans by posting on social media that he didn't ""want to be on this earth anymore"", not long after his high-profile breakup from ex-fiance Ariana Grande.""I had a lot of prior issues and a lot of stuff that I was dealing with personally that I wanted to bring to the forefront so that I could not only make a movie but also just grow as a person,"" says Davidson, who has borderline personality disorder, as well as Crohn's Disease.""What I wanted to do was maybe after we did this I could put that part of my life behind me and, not forget it, but move forward and have a new outlook on life.""Apatow believes the lead character, who daydreams about one day running a tattoo restaurant, is a fair reflection of what Pete's life might be like now if he hadn't found his comedy calling.The pair first worked together on another Apatow film - 2015's Trainwreck, and he describes Davidson as ""a funny, great, fascinating person"".That particular film gave another comic actor and writer, Amy Schumer, her big movie break, and other stars including Steve Carell, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and Kristen Wiig have all benefitted similarly from his direction early on.Now, with no cinematic release, due to the Covid-19 virus shutting theatres, and against the backdrop of mass Black Lives Matter protests, following the death of George Floyd, Davidson admits it's ""an odd time to put something out"".""It's nice to put something positive into the world, so I hope people enjoy it,"" he says.Making movies, Apatow stresses, is ""one of the hardest professions to make safe"", as they are ""all about being close to each other, touching each other, and being in very small spaces"".The director also hopes the protests, for people who ""were ignored for a very long time"" ultimately ""lead to meaningful change,"" and he urges people to vote for it in the US elections in November.""I just hope that people are kinder to each other in the future,"" adds Davidson.The thing they both miss most about the old pre-coronavirus world is the ability to simply hang out with friends at comedy clubs, where Apatow also began his career, as a stand-up. The 52-year-old jokes they'll both mark their film's online release by simultaneously pressing play on iPads from their own respective beds!The King of Staten Island is a film about trauma, loss, and the healing qualities of opening your heart again to love and laughter.What might Davidson's dad have made of it?""I think if my dad was around he would get a kick out of it,"" says the leading man. ""He would be like, 'holy crap, dude, that's crazy!'""My dad was a huge comedy fan, so I think he would just be thrilled"".As well as being there in spirit, the real Scott is made flesh on-screen not only by his son, but also by his own father Stephen, who makes a scene-stealing cameo as Grandpa. Apatow says: ""The truth is Pete, we never talked about it... your grandfather actually would get called, you can see him as a regular on Seinfeld. He actually could have been that guy"".""Oh yeah, he'll get some work out of this,"" nods his rather more famous grandson. For now, at least.The King of Staten Island is out now on various platforms now",12 June 2020,entertainment
