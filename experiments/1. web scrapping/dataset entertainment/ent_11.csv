UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale; one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment
Emmerdale to show characters dealing with lockdown,"Emmerdale has started its ""phased return to filming"", by recording new episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown, ITV has announced.Six new episodes are currently being worked on at the soap's studios in Leeds, with a scaled-down crew.They will explore key characters reflecting on life, and past feuds.""Lockdown has created an opportunity for us to focus on what is important in our lives,"" said executive producer Jane Hudson.""When we first discussed commissioning these episodes back in March the writers instantly rose to the challenge.""Filming on the Yorkshire-based show ground to a halt in March, in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.Now, social distancing measures have been introduced on-set, in line with new government guidelines, and there will be no filming on location during the two-week shoot, which will ""ensure it stays on air in June"", Thursday's statement read.Hudson stressed that after seven weeks of lockdown, the new scripts - which feature a smaller number of actors and scenes than usual - have ""an added poignancy and meaning"".""The response from everyone at Emmerdale to filming these episodes has been fantastic and we're really grateful for their support,"" she went on.Other popular soaps like EastEnders and Coronation Street are also due to return to filming in a similar manner next month, and storylines will reference the ongoing pandemic, while not necessarily focusing on it.The Metro's soaps editor Duncan Lindsay this week argued that such shows should not include the current real-life situation in their ""fictional world.""However, John Whiston, ITV's head of drama, said: ""It will be great to see what the likes of Chas and Paddy and Jimmy and Nicola have got up to while they've been going through lockdown the same as the rest of us.""",21 May 2020,entertainment
How live entertainment is evolving online to be a lifeline in lockdown,"From gigs to plays and quizzes, live entertainment has moved online during coronavirus lockdown - and creative minds are coming up with new ideas to give us back some of the human connection we've lost.Every Saturday for the past two months, Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has sat down and written a song.Well, he has co-written a song - with 5,000 fans on Instagram.He asks them for chords, comes up with melodies, and puts them to a vote. He then asks for ideas for lyrics before coming back an hour later with a finished track. ""Some are really good,"" he says.

But with this, it feels like you're engaging with everybody.""The fans also vote for the set lists in his regular online concerts. ""I could just choose a bunch of songs that I want to play, which I did do one week and it just didn't really work,"" Lightbody says. ""It just felt a little disconnected.""I miss playing live, I do. But it's going to be a long time, so this is what we've got.""With the communal thrill of congregating in the same room currently out of the question, Lightbody is among the artists to have come up with interesting ways to bring people together.When his Saturday Songwrite sessions have generated 10 or 12 decent tracks, he'll release an album for charity - although he hasn't settled on a charity yet. ""It might be best to put that to a vote as well.""Few musicians haven't done online performances, which can have an intimate charm (but can also be quite dull, beyond the voyeuristic kick of having a nosey in their houses).Lightbody recommends fellow Northern Irish singer Roe, who could teach the bigger names a thing or two about audio and video quality.This was filmed in isolation with Jay Dickson on the drums.

Plus, the magical, fantastical storytelling of theatre doesn't translate well to the screen.""What doesn't work is watching streaming of plays on computers,"" playwright Simon Stephens told BBC Radio 4's Front Row last week. ""Whenever I watch those I just feel lonelier than I felt before.""What is interesting is when writers, directors, actors and designers start thinking about - what are the dramatic potentials of Zoom?""In recent weeks, creative types have been exploring just that.David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman and Denise Gough starred in A Separate Peace, a one-act play by Sir Tom Stoppard on Zoom.""I'm fascinated by the format, which is a completely new kind of way of putting on a play where paradoxically you stay home and live theatre comes to you,"" Sir Tom said.The show tried to replicate something of the live experience, with audience members buying a ticket in advance and turning up at an allotted time - the performance deliberately wasn't put online to watch afterwards.It had professional crew, including video, lighting, costume and sound designers, and the actors (all at home, obviously) entered and exited their quarters of the screen as they would a stage. ""The cast were saying they were so nervous, like 'I really felt like I was standing in the wings,'"" says producer Matt Humphrey.""We want to show other people that this can be done and give confidence to other people that live theatre still has a place during lockdown."" And he believes such Zoom-style shows will still have a place when quarantine lifts.The Guardian's five-star review declared: ""If, for however long, this is live theatre's future, then it works triumphantly.""Another Zoom theatre triumph got the audience fully involved from their sofas.In a playful version of The Tempest from Northern Ireland-based theatre company Big Telly and Oxford's Creation Theatre, viewers were asked to help out by doing things like making storm sound effects and pretending to be a flock of birds. The most enthusiastic were spotlighted on screen for the rest of the audience to see.Another show, Operation Elsewhere, was originally ""an immersive theatre game"" played in the real world.  When the world locked down, it was hastily reworked for Zoom - also with lots of audience participation.""People turn all the lights off and get under blankets because we need cover of darkness,"" Big Telly artistic director Zoe Seaton explains.

Green screens and social distancing - TV industry publishes guidelines to resume filming,"Actors will have to stand 2m apart and film in front of green screens more often when TV shows resume, according to new guidance.The measures form part of a back-to-work blueprint issued by the UK's biggest broadcasters on Monday.They have been adopted by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky to protect actors and crews during the pandemic.It is hoped that soaps including EastEnders and Coronation Street will start filming again in June.William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in Corrie, told BBC Radio Derby on Monday that cast members had been told filming should re-start in mid-June.""They've said it's all going to be very, very different,"" he said. ""Scenes will be about the lockdown, so people will be isolating. Scenes will be shot more simply with less people.""Obviously cameras and booms will be placed where there's the required distance. So it's all going to be very, very different when we do get back.""However, Roache, 88, added that older residents of the street would not return immediately for health reasons.""Senior members of the cast will not be called back for some time, sadly. I'd like to get back,"" he said.Among the measures recommended in the 15-page guidelines are:The guidelines also urge caution over high-risk scenarios involving stunts or special effects, saying producers should consider the ""potential demands on emergency services"".Mental health is also addressed, with producers advised to schedule down-time, along with access to support.Although some TV shows have continued to film during the lockdown, most major productions have been shut down. Last week, the BBC said production would restart on Top Gear and EastEnders by the end of June, while plans are also being drawn up to resume shoots on other independently-produced shows.""We can only move forward with the right safety measures in place,"" said BBC director general Tony Hall.

A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment
Emmerdale to show characters dealing with lockdown,"Emmerdale has started its ""phased return to filming"", by recording new episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown, ITV has announced.Six new episodes are currently being worked on at the soap's studios in Leeds, with a scaled-down crew.They will explore key characters reflecting on life, and past feuds.""Lockdown has created an opportunity for us to focus on what is important in our lives,"" said executive producer Jane Hudson.""When we first discussed commissioning these episodes back in March the writers instantly rose to the challenge.""Filming on the Yorkshire-based show ground to a halt in March, in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.Now, social distancing measures have been introduced on-set, in line with new government guidelines, and there will be no filming on location during the two-week shoot, which will ""ensure it stays on air in June"", Thursday's statement read.Hudson stressed that after seven weeks of lockdown, the new scripts - which feature a smaller number of actors and scenes than usual - have ""an added poignancy and meaning"".""The response from everyone at Emmerdale to filming these episodes has been fantastic and we're really grateful for their support,"" she went on.Other popular soaps like EastEnders and Coronation Street are also due to return to filming in a similar manner next month, and storylines will reference the ongoing pandemic, while not necessarily focusing on it.The Metro's soaps editor Duncan Lindsay this week argued that such shows should not include the current real-life situation in their ""fictional world.""However, John Whiston, ITV's head of drama, said: ""It will be great to see what the likes of Chas and Paddy and Jimmy and Nicola have got up to while they've been going through lockdown the same as the rest of us.""",21 May 2020,entertainment
How live entertainment is evolving online to be a lifeline in lockdown,"From gigs to plays and quizzes, live entertainment has moved online during coronavirus lockdown - and creative minds are coming up with new ideas to give us back some of the human connection we've lost.Every Saturday for the past two months, Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has sat down and written a song.Well, he has co-written a song - with 5,000 fans on Instagram.He asks them for chords, comes up with melodies, and puts them to a vote. He then asks for ideas for lyrics before coming back an hour later with a finished track. ""Some are really good,"" he says. End of Youtube post  by Snow PatrolLightbody also performs solo online gigs from home, but wanted to do something more collaborative too.""You can say absolutely anything in this. It's therapeutic and cathartic for me,"" he explains.""In a 'gig', I chat a little bit, but you can't really read the comments because you're playing songs. But with this, it feels like you're engaging with everybody.""The fans also vote for the set lists in his regular online concerts. ""I could just choose a bunch of songs that I want to play, which I did do one week and it just didn't really work,"" Lightbody says. ""It just felt a little disconnected.""I miss playing live, I do. But it's going to be a long time, so this is what we've got.""With the communal thrill of congregating in the same room currently out of the question, Lightbody is among the artists to have come up with interesting ways to bring people together.When his Saturday Songwrite sessions have generated 10 or 12 decent tracks, he'll release an album for charity - although he hasn't settled on a charity yet. ""It might be best to put that to a vote as well.""Few musicians haven't done online performances, which can have an intimate charm (but can also be quite dull, beyond the voyeuristic kick of having a nosey in their houses).Lightbody recommends fellow Northern Irish singer Roe, who could teach the bigger names a thing or two about audio and video quality.This was filmed in isolation with Jay Dickson on the drums. We thought this would be a cool thing to do right now seeing...End of Facebook post  by ROESome performers get their fans involved - whether by taking requests or doing Q&As, virtual charity festivals or tutorials like Duran Duran star John Taylor with his bass masterclasses and Oti Mabuse with her dance lessons.Listening parties have also been a big hit. Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess has carved out a sideline as host of #timstwitterlisteningparty. Fans and musicians listen together in real time, tweeting their thoughts and memories.""There's power in listening and knowing others are doing so at the same as you,"" Burgess told The Sunday Times.In the US, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland - who staged a song-for-song producer clash in 2018 - now run a regular lockdown face-off, inviting different stars to go head-to-head in weekly Verzuz battles on Instagram.Erykah Badu and Jill Scott's recent battle was more of a love-in, and drew 700,000 live viewers.The New York Times has called Verzuz ""perhaps the most powerful quarantine-friendly entertainment franchise going"".Last night's #VERZUZ was special ✨ Thank you @fatbellybella and @missjillscott 🙏@Timbaland @THEREALSWIZZZ pic.twitter.com/8iOLySRompEnd of Twitter post  by @verzuzonlineBeyond music, lockdown may turn out to be a tipping point for activities like quizzes, choirs, and exercise, yoga and cookery lessons, which have found new leases of life online (despite the inevitable loss of the human touch).In theatre, as in music, it's hard to replicate the live experience on screen. But some are using technology to create a new kind of show.Although monologues have been filmed in lockdown and pre-recorded shows have been put online, they often can't capture the excitement of being in an audience. Plus, the magical, fantastical storytelling of theatre doesn't translate well to the screen.""What doesn't work is watching streaming of plays on computers,"" playwright Simon Stephens told BBC Radio 4's Front Row last week. ""Whenever I watch those I just feel lonelier than I felt before.""What is interesting is when writers, directors, actors and designers start thinking about - what are the dramatic potentials of Zoom?""In recent weeks, creative types have been exploring just that.David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman and Denise Gough starred in A Separate Peace, a one-act play by Sir Tom Stoppard on Zoom.""I'm fascinated by the format, which is a completely new kind of way of putting on a play where paradoxically you stay home and live theatre comes to you,"" Sir Tom said.The show tried to replicate something of the live experience, with audience members buying a ticket in advance and turning up at an allotted time - the performance deliberately wasn't put online to watch afterwards.It had professional crew, including video, lighting, costume and sound designers, and the actors (all at home, obviously) entered and exited their quarters of the screen as they would a stage. ""The cast were saying they were so nervous, like 'I really felt like I was standing in the wings,'"" says producer Matt Humphrey.""We want to show other people that this can be done and give confidence to other people that live theatre still has a place during lockdown."" And he believes such Zoom-style shows will still have a place when quarantine lifts.The Guardian's five-star review declared: ""If, for however long, this is live theatre's future, then it works triumphantly.""Another Zoom theatre triumph got the audience fully involved from their sofas.In a playful version of The Tempest from Northern Ireland-based theatre company Big Telly and Oxford's Creation Theatre, viewers were asked to help out by doing things like making storm sound effects and pretending to be a flock of birds. The most enthusiastic were spotlighted on screen for the rest of the audience to see.Another show, Operation Elsewhere, was originally ""an immersive theatre game"" played in the real world.  When the world locked down, it was hastily reworked for Zoom - also with lots of audience participation.""People turn all the lights off and get under blankets because we need cover of darkness,"" Big Telly artistic director Zoe Seaton explains. ""There was one point where a character says, 'If you've got war paint get it on now', and you see people rushing to the kitchen and getting ketchup and things.""End of Youtube post  by Big TellyVirtual backgrounds and green screens can create settings and effects that would be difficult and expensive in real life. ""I'm really enjoying it because it feels like a new box of tricks, a new way of telling stories,"" Seaton says.People have been tuning in from around the world and using the shows to have a shared night ""out"" with separated family members.""The joy of seeing your nephew and niece in Canada doing something in the same show that you're part of has just been amazing,"" Seaton says. ""We're interested in taking that further.""We work in rural communities in Ireland mostly, as well as Belfast and Derry, and suddenly our audience are in Brooklyn, and you think, oh gosh!""The key has been inviting the audience to bring the shows to life, Seaton adds. ""They have had that sense of community that theatre has, where you're all on the same journey. ""That's their main success. I think that's what people are missing in lockdown - that sense of community.""",18 May 2020,entertainment
Green screens and social distancing - TV industry publishes guidelines to resume filming,"Actors will have to stand 2m apart and film in front of green screens more often when TV shows resume, according to new guidance.The measures form part of a back-to-work blueprint issued by the UK's biggest broadcasters on Monday.They have been adopted by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky to protect actors and crews during the pandemic.It is hoped that soaps including EastEnders and Coronation Street will start filming again in June.William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in Corrie, told BBC Radio Derby on Monday that cast members had been told filming should re-start in mid-June.""They've said it's all going to be very, very different,"" he said. ""Scenes will be about the lockdown, so people will be isolating. Scenes will be shot more simply with less people.""Obviously cameras and booms will be placed where there's the required distance. So it's all going to be very, very different when we do get back.""However, Roache, 88, added that older residents of the street would not return immediately for health reasons.""Senior members of the cast will not be called back for some time, sadly. I'd like to get back,"" he said.Among the measures recommended in the 15-page guidelines are:The guidelines also urge caution over high-risk scenarios involving stunts or special effects, saying producers should consider the ""potential demands on emergency services"".Mental health is also addressed, with producers advised to schedule down-time, along with access to support.Although some TV shows have continued to film during the lockdown, most major productions have been shut down. Last week, the BBC said production would restart on Top Gear and EastEnders by the end of June, while plans are also being drawn up to resume shoots on other independently-produced shows.""We can only move forward with the right safety measures in place,"" said BBC director general Tony Hall. ""This guidance is an attempt to get that right.""ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall said: ""ITV has been at the heart of informing, entertaining and connecting the UK through the Covid-19 crisis.""Our production teams are now working hard to bring many more much loved shows back for viewers.""The new guidelines were welcomed by the government, with Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden calling them ""a significant step forward in getting our favourite shows back into production"".",18 May 2020,entertainment
Lord Hall: People have turned to BBC 'in their droves' during pandemic,"People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic.He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home. The BBC could lose £125m in revenue because of coronavirus, he added.Lord Hall also said he recognised the need for a ""big debate"" about the future of the BBC and the way it is funded.The director general, who is set to leave his role in the summer, said younger audiences had been coming back to the BBC during the lockdown, with shows such as Normal People becoming huge hits.The corporation said that 94% of the British public used the BBC in the third week of March when social distancing began in the UK - with 86% of younger people between the ages of 16-34 also accessing BBC content. Lord Hall also credited this success to its ""biggest ever educational programme"", as well the launch of Culture in Quarantine - an arts and culture service which Lord Hall says keeps ""the arts alive in people's homes and support the arts sector during challenging times"".He was pressed on plans to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel, four years after it was taken off air and moved online to save costs.Lord Hall said the initial plans had been a ""fantastic, creative success"" and showed ""the importance of developing our iPlayer, developing our sounds and making sure that our new services are in tip top position for young audiences to come to"".However, he acknowledged that the broadcaster could potentially lose £125m as a result of coronavirus, meaning it would have to spend ""wisely"" in future. The BBC is facing financial pressure after being forced to delay the end of the free TV licence scheme for all over-75s.It also had to postpone plans to cut 450 jobs, and said there was uncertainty around commercial revenues.Lord Hall said that he hopes in future, there will be a ""big debate"" about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the current charter comes to an end. He said: ""The question is, what's the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share.""I hope even when I've left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone.""It comes after a public consultation was launched by the government on whether failure to pay for a TV licence should stop being a criminal offence, with the BBC warning it would cost the corporation more than £1bn over five years.",24 May 2020,entertainment
The Joe Rogan Experience: Will Gompertz reviews episode #1470 with Elon Musk ★★★☆☆,"They used to say everybody had a book in them. Then it changed to everybody had a blog in them. Now, everybody has a podcast in them. And that's just where the book-blog-pod should stay in 99.9% of cases. But there are handful of people who have taken to podcasting like Luke Skywalker to a lightsaber and become masters of cyberspace broadcasting. Elizabeth Day has gone from journalist to novelist to prominent media figure with her How To Fail podcast. George The Poet has cut through with his meditative musings, while the footballer Peter Crouch has turned into a surprise comedy star with his laddish tales from the locker-room. In America - where the art of podcasting was honed with shows like Serial, This American Life and Radiolab - the medium has long had a seat at the top table of the entertainment business. As was made evident this week with the announcement that the Swedish streaming service Spotify had paid a huge sum of money - the Wall Street Journal reported the deal could be worth around $100 million (£82 million) - for exclusive rights to a Californian-based podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan is a famous personality in the US. He first made his name as a stand-up comic, then turned to acting, before hosting a TV show featuring wince-inducing dares, and between all this established himself as a respected mixed martial arts UFC commentator. He started his eponymous podcast in 2009 as a ""mates chatting"" sort of thing, which it basically still is, although some of his mates are now Senators and Harvard professors. Anyway, it works: the show is said to have over 190 million monthly downloads, which is a lot of listeners by any measure (it is also available for free on YouTube, for now).I visited his website to hear what all the fuss was about, and chose episode #1470 from a couple of weeks ago, in which Rogan chats to Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla car boss. He'd had Musk on the show before, offered him a puff on his joint (cannabis is legal in the state where the show is made), which Elon duly accepted, leading to headlines and a sharp drop in Tesla's share price. The episode I listened to didn't have any such incidents. The two men began by chewing the fat about Musk's newly-born baby, to whom the businessman and his partner had given a name that sounded like a line of code written by one of his company's boffs. Rogan was amused and enthusiastic as the conversation gently meandered towards the topic of connecting computers to our brains, a concept that appeared to enthral and appal the host in equal measure.Not so the quietly-spoken Musk, who considered the prospect of a ""whole brain interface"" where ""more of you would be in the cloud than in your body"", to be viable within decades. Don't worry if that seems like too long to wait, because he also thought if all went to plan, that in five years we won't have to talk anymore because we'll be able to communicate our unfettered thoughts through neural links. These were not small things to posit given the obvious ramifications, particularly for The Joe Rogan Experience: no talking, no podcast. But our host didn't seem concerned or particularly interested in interrogating the breezy claims his guest made with a matter-of-factness that equated to someone putting a live grenade in your hand and mentioning, by-the-by, it could be quite dangerous. That's not to say Rogan was disengaged. It's just that his natural curiosity tended to stop at wow without getting to why. Which is fine, that's the nature of the show: guests are allowed to talk as much and as long as they like, often for hours, with Rogan the interlocutor playing the role of everyman: a part he has nailed better than almost anyone else in the world of podcasts, if one was judging by numbers alone (downloads, YouTube views, Instagram followers etc.).He is, as they say nowadays, relatable. His listeners get him, like him; maybe even want to be him. He's not a show-pony, or a light-entertainment phoney: he's the all-American do it yourself modern man, tough but intelligent. Joe Rogan is the Bruce Springsteen of chat.The Boss has taken his brand global, whether Rogan can repeat the feat in the talk-show genre will be interesting to see. The two men have much in common. They share the same muscular male aesthetic, with a love of T-shirts and no BS. They're both come from New Jersey. They both had troubled relationships with their fathers - Springsteen's dad was a bus driver, Rogan's a cop. And they both found fame as the front man on stage.Given the size of its investment, Spotify must be hoping Rogan can compete with Springsteen in terms of reach and appeal. I'm not so sure he can having listened to his show. Songs can be reinterpreted, meaning can morph and be personalised - less so with chat, which tends to be specific to the host and his or her culture. I quite enjoyed listening to his conversation with Musk, but I wouldn't download another show in a rush for entertainment's sake. It wasn't just because the entrepreneur could say almost anything without being challenged - there's a section about Covid-19 when I found my eyebrows rise while Joe's and Elon's were furrowed in agreement (I believe in previous episodes Rogan has been more sceptical). The main problem is my cultural reference points are different, I don't relate to Joe Rogan. I'm not interested in mixed martial arts or conspiracy theories or smoking weed or drinking hard liquor or camping or ""dumb things"". I don't care if a Tesla car can accelerate to 60 mph in under two seconds or want to hear what Elon Musk has to say to ""all the fools out there"" - another throwaway remark that went unchallenged.Nevertheless, the host clearly reflects the views and tastes of a vast number of American people, and has developed a format with which they can connect and hear his thoughts and those of his guests (male-skewed, judging by the recent roster). And that's why I will continue to download his show: Not to be amused but to be informed.  Listen to The Joe Rogan Experience and you hear America.

Tenet: Trailer for Christopher Nolan film arrives minus release date,"A second trailer for Christopher Nolan's mysterious new film Tenet has been released, giving more clues about its complex time travel narrative.Unlike the teaser trailer released in December, however, the new promo does not end with confirmation of the film's scheduled 17 July release date.The trailer instead merely states it will be ""coming to theaters"" [sic].The three-minute trailer was launched on popular video game Fortnite before being made available elsewhere.Cinemas around the world are closed due to the coronavirus pandemic and it is unclear when they will reopen.Earlier this month the CEO of the Vue chain expressed hopes it will be able to reopen its cinemas in July.The Showcase cinemas chain said it was also ""working towards"" welcoming back customers at the beginning of that month.End of Youtube post  by Warner Bros. PicturesAccording to Fortnite publisher Epic Games, the idea to launch the trailer in the game ""came from a phone call with Christopher Nolan"".""We were all talking about our love of seeing new trailers in a THEATER and how sad we were that we can't do that right now - but how maybe this could be the next best thing,"" tweeted its creative director Donald Mustard.It has also been announced that one of Nolan's previous feature films will be screened inside the game later this year.The British director's other films include Inception, Interstellar and the Oscar-winning World War II film Dunkirk.He also directed the three films in the so-called Dark Knight trilogy - Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.According to Tenet's distributor Warner Bros, his new film is ""an action epic evolving from the world of international espionage"".Its stars include John David Washington from Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman, Twilight's Robert Pattinson and Sir Kenneth Branagh.According to the new trailer, Sir Kenneth - who also appeared in Dunkirk - plays a ""Russian national"" who can ""communicate with the future"".The trailer sees a character use the word ""inversion"" alongside scenes in which events appear to play out in reverse.The trailer features a car chase in which vehicles move both backwards and forwards, close-combat fights and shots of a plane crashing into a hangar.""This reversing of the flow of time,"" Washington's character is heard saying. ""Doesn't us being here now mean it never happened?""Reaction on Twitter has been broadly positive, with users variously describing it as ""stunning"", ""so good"" and ""iconic"".""This is Christopher Nolan's world and we're just living in it,"" tweeted another impressed commentator.Tenet's own Twitter page states categorically that the film will be ""coming to theaters"" on 17 July.That will be reassuring to cinema operators following the decision of some distributors to bypass theatrical distribution and release their films directly online.Universal released Trolls World Tour online in April, while Sir Kenneth's film version of Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl novel will premiere on the Disney+ streaming service next month.Before the coronavirus crisis caused cinemas and other entertainment venues to close their doors, the films had been scheduled to open theatrically in April and May respectively.",22 May 2020,entertainment

Tony Slattery 'moved' by reaction to documentary,"Comedian Tony Slattery has said he's been ""genuinely moved"" by the reaction to the documentary about his battles with depression and drug addiction.What's the Matter with Tony Slattery?, on BBC Two's Horizon on Thursday, was broadcast following a revealing article in The Guardian in 2019.The programme followed the Whose Line Is It Anyway? star as he attempted to connect the dots between his undiagnosed bipolar tendencies, drug and alcohol use, and the abuse he suffered as a child by a priest.""I'm genuinely moved by all your messages of love, kindness, & support,"" he wrote on Twitter on Friday, paying special homage to his long-time partner Mark - ""the love of my life"".Slattery was an improvisational stand-up comedy TV star of the 80s and 90s, but withdrew from the public eye afterwards, due to deep-rooted and wide-ranging personal issues.The documentary saw him return to the stage in front of a live audience for the first time in decades.Viewers from around the worlds of medicine, comedy and beyond have praised him for finally telling his story.I hope that, above all, the public have a better understanding of how #mentalillness childhood trauma and #addiction are inextricably bound.

To assess, treat and help people with #recovery needs years of training. #TonySlatteryEnd of Twitter post  by @oldagepsychStephen Fry, who appeared in the feature to discuss his own experiences of mental health issues, described Slattery - a fellow ex-member the Cambridge University Footlights comedy set - as being ""painfully honest and as always utterly lovable"".""No-one in their right mind chooses to be depressed,"" Slattery told his old friend Fry in the programme.Another comedian and broadcaster, Robin Ince, said it was ""sad to watch"" but ""a documentary that is definitely worth your time"".Ahead of the showing going out, Slattery told the Today programme's Nick Robinson it was ""a privilege"" to speak to experts about such issues, which he says are ""widespread, regardless of class or upbringing or money"".""There was denial,"" he added. ""Because I thought, 'look, some things happened a quarter of a century ago, I'm 60 now, [it was] when I was eight, what is the point?'""Slattery admitted on-screen that he worried the show was too ""self-regarding"", but just hoped it might at least help others in similar situations.The Times gave the feature five stars, with Carol Midgley, writing it was about ""how a comedian's tragedy was redeemed by love"".Lucy Mangan in The Guardian awarded four stars, calling it ""a moving study of drink, depression and abuse"".""Horizon's respectful and sensitive look at the comedian's life and struggles with addiction is a beacon of the genre,"" she wrote.""It was tough to watch the brightest of stars so dimmed,"" added Anita Singh in The Telegraph, also opting for four stars, while adding it was ""a brave film to make"".Sources: NHS, Royal College of Psychiatrists and Mind",22 May 2020,entertainment
UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale; one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment

How live entertainment is evolving online to be a lifeline in lockdown,"From gigs to plays and quizzes, live entertainment has moved online during coronavirus lockdown - and creative minds are coming up with new ideas to give us back some of the human connection we've lost.Every Saturday for the past two months, Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has sat down and written a song.Well, he has co-written a song - with 5,000 fans on Instagram.He asks them for chords, comes up with melodies, and puts them to a vote.

Lord Hall: People have turned to BBC 'in their droves' during pandemic,"People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic.He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home.

The Joe Rogan Experience: Will Gompertz reviews episode #1470 with Elon Musk ★★★☆☆,"They used to say everybody had a book in them. Then it changed to everybody had a blog in them. Now, everybody has a podcast in them. And that's just where the book-blog-pod should stay in 99.9% of cases. But there are handful of people who have taken to podcasting like Luke Skywalker to a lightsaber and become masters of cyberspace broadcasting. Elizabeth Day has gone from journalist to novelist to prominent media figure with her How To Fail podcast. George The Poet has cut through with his meditative musings, while the footballer Peter Crouch has turned into a surprise comedy star with his laddish tales from the locker-room. In America - where the art of podcasting was honed with shows like Serial, This American Life and Radiolab - the medium has long had a seat at the top table of the entertainment business. As was made evident this week with the announcement that the Swedish streaming service Spotify had paid a huge sum of money - the Wall Street Journal reported the deal could be worth around $100 million (£82 million) - for exclusive rights to a Californian-based podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan is a famous personality in the US. He first made his name as a stand-up comic, then turned to acting, before hosting a TV show featuring wince-inducing dares, and between all this established himself as a respected mixed martial arts UFC commentator. He started his eponymous podcast in 2009 as a ""mates chatting"" sort of thing, which it basically still is, although some of his mates are now Senators and Harvard professors. Anyway, it works: the show is said to have over 190 million monthly downloads, which is a lot of listeners by any measure (it is also available for free on YouTube, for now).I visited his website to hear what all the fuss was about, and chose episode #1470 from a couple of weeks ago, in which Rogan chats to Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla car boss. He'd had Musk on the show before, offered him a puff on his joint (cannabis is legal in the state where the show is made), which Elon duly accepted, leading to headlines and a sharp drop in Tesla's share price. The episode I listened to didn't have any such incidents. The two men began by chewing the fat about Musk's newly-born baby, to whom the businessman and his partner had given a name that sounded like a line of code written by one of his company's boffs. Rogan was amused and enthusiastic as the conversation gently meandered towards the topic of connecting computers to our brains, a concept that appeared to enthral and appal the host in equal measure.Not so the quietly-spoken Musk, who considered the prospect of a ""whole brain interface"" where ""more of you would be in the cloud than in your body"", to be viable within decades. Don't worry if that seems like too long to wait, because he also thought if all went to plan, that in five years we won't have to talk anymore because we'll be able to communicate our unfettered thoughts through neural links. These were not small things to posit given the obvious ramifications, particularly for The Joe Rogan Experience: no talking, no podcast. But our host didn't seem concerned or particularly interested in interrogating the breezy claims his guest made with a matter-of-factness that equated to someone putting a live grenade in your hand and mentioning, by-the-by, it could be quite dangerous. That's not to say Rogan was disengaged. It's just that his natural curiosity tended to stop at wow without getting to why. Which is fine, that's the nature of the show: guests are allowed to talk as much and as long as they like, often for hours, with Rogan the interlocutor playing the role of everyman: a part he has nailed better than almost anyone else in the world of podcasts, if one was judging by numbers alone (downloads, YouTube views, Instagram followers etc.).He is, as they say nowadays, relatable. His listeners get him, like him; maybe even want to be him. He's not a show-pony, or a light-entertainment phoney: he's the all-American do it yourself modern man, tough but intelligent. Joe Rogan is the Bruce Springsteen of chat.The Boss has taken his brand global, whether Rogan can repeat the feat in the talk-show genre will be interesting to see. The two men have much in common. They share the same muscular male aesthetic, with a love of T-shirts and no BS. They're both come from New Jersey. They both had troubled relationships with their fathers - Springsteen's dad was a bus driver, Rogan's a cop. And they both found fame as the front man on stage.Given the size of its investment, Spotify must be hoping Rogan can compete with Springsteen in terms of reach and appeal. I'm not so sure he can having listened to his show. Songs can be reinterpreted, meaning can morph and be personalised - less so with chat, which tends to be specific to the host and his or her culture. I quite enjoyed listening to his conversation with Musk, but I wouldn't download another show in a rush for entertainment's sake. It wasn't just because the entrepreneur could say almost anything without being challenged - there's a section about Covid-19 when I found my eyebrows rise while Joe's and Elon's were furrowed in agreement (I believe in previous episodes Rogan has been more sceptical). The main problem is my cultural reference points are different, I don't relate to Joe Rogan. I'm not interested in mixed martial arts or conspiracy theories or smoking weed or drinking hard liquor or camping or ""dumb things"". I don't care if a Tesla car can accelerate to 60 mph in under two seconds or want to hear what Elon Musk has to say to ""all the fools out there"" - another throwaway remark that went unchallenged.Nevertheless, the host clearly reflects the views and tastes of a vast number of American people, and has developed a format with which they can connect and hear his thoughts and those of his guests (male-skewed, judging by the recent roster). And that's why I will continue to download his show: Not to be amused but to be informed.  Listen to The Joe Rogan Experience and you hear America.

Pop stars pose on their doorsteps for lockdown project,"Pop stars including Rag 'N' Bone Man, Roachford and Joy Crookes have all taken socially-distanced doorstep portraits, as they tell the BBC how they've been surviving the lockdown.Spice Girl Mel C posed with her laptop and headphones, saying they've been ""my window to the world"" while isolating. Rapper Raxstar held a framed photo of his cousin and uncle, both of whom died after contracting coronavirus.""Losing them has been a big blow to our whole family,"" he told the BBC.""I want to keep their memories and spirits alive in everything I do going forward.""While most of the artists said they'd continued making new music during the lockdown, others have been inspired to pursue new ideas.Soul singer Ray BLK  has discovered a hidden talent for nail art.""As I haven't been able to go to the nail shop to get my nails done, I have people making custom nails, and I thought: 'This is so amazing being able to have all these great designs, and being able to do them myself at home.'

Ruby Rose leaves Batwoman - and other stars who exited major roles,"The Australian actress Ruby Rose is to leave her role as comic book superhero Batwoman after just one series.Rose said it had been a ""very difficult decision"" not to return to the show, which is shown in the UK on E4.Batwoman, which began on the CW network last year, is the first superhero show to have an openly gay lead character.Its producers said they were ""firmly committed"" to the show's ""long-term"" future and would re-cast the role with another member of the LGBTQ community.Rose, who is herself gay, said she was ""truly grateful... to everyone who made season one a success"". The 34-year-old said she had ""the utmost respect"" for everyone involved and that the decision to leave had not been ""made lightly"".Rose faced a backlash on social media when she was cast as Batwoman, with some saying the role should have gone to a lesbian actress.The actress, who has called herself ""gender-fluid"" in interviews, later deleted her Twitter profile, though she remains active on Instagram.Last year Rose revealed she had suffered an injury while filming the series that had required her to undergo emergency surgery.The actress said she had ""herniated two discs doing stunts"" - but Deadline reported the injury was not the reason for her departure.Born in Melbourne in 1986, Rose played Stella Carlin in Orange is the New Black and has appeared in such films as Pitch Perfect 3 and The Meg.Yet she is far from the first actor to leave or be replaced in a major film or TV show.George Lazenby famously walked away from the role of James Bond after making just one appearance in the popular spy film series.The model turned actor later admitted he had been persuaded by his then-manager - the late Ronan O'Rahilly - to seek other opportunities.""I thought he knew what he was talking about so I listened to him,"" the Australian told an audience at the National Film Theatre last year.Lazenby's single outing as Bond, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was released in 1969 and is now a firm fan favourite.Christopher Eccleston was cast as The Doctor when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 - but he departed after a single series.The actor, who was replaced by David Tennant, later said he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture"" of the show.""My relationship with my three immediate superiors... broke down irreparably during the first block of filming and it never recovered,"" he elaborated in 2018.The actor, currently to be seen in The A Word on BBC One, also said he had been ""out of his comfort zone"" playing the sci-fi drama's time-travelling hero.Edward Norton was cast as Bruce Banner in 2008's The Incredible Hulk but did not reprise the role in Marvel Studios' subsequent comic-book blockbusters.Its president Kevin Feige later said the role had been recast out of a ""need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members"".Speaking last year, Norton called Feige's 2010 statement ""cheap"" and that his exit had been the result of differing views on how to depict the character.""Ultimately they weren't going for long, dark and serious,"" said Norton, who was replaced by Mark Ruffalo when The Hulk returned in 2012's Avengers Assemble.Terrence Howard, who played James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in 2008's Iron Man, is another actor to be replaced in Marvel's superhero film series.He later claimed he was offered less money than he had been promised to reprise the role, which Don Cheadle has played since 2010's Iron Man 2.Sharon Gless played Christine Cagney in Cagney and Lacey for seven years, winning two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for her pains.Yet she was not the first actress to play the part in the popular US TV series about two female police detectives solving crimes in New York City.Loretta Swit played Cagney in the original TV movie but was not able to continue in the role when the CBS show went to series.Meg Foster was then cast, only to be replaced after six episodes because CBS allegedly wanted someone ""more feminine"" in the role.Speaking in 2012, Gless praised her co-star Tyne Daly for ""welcoming me as if she had not had anybody before me"".""I know her heart was hurting because she loved her last Cagney,"" she revealed.When Men Behaving Badly first began in 1992, the two flatmates were played by Martin Clunes and Harry Enfield.According to Clunes, though, the show that ITV produced did not match Enfield's hopes for it.""His original vision was for it not to be like a usual sitcom,"" Clunes told The Guardian in 2013. ""Then we made the pilot and it shocked him.""You could see Harry wanted out,"" he continued. ""He was under contract, though, so had to do one series.""Neil Morrissey was subsequently cast as Clunes' flatmate in the show, which continued on ITV for another series before being picked up by the BBC.Jodie Foster earned her second best actress Oscar for playing Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs - one of five Academy Awards Jonathan Demme's film won in 1992.When the offer came to reprise her role in Hannibal, though, she turned it down - opening the door for Julianne Moore to appear with Anthony Hopkins in Ridley Scott's 2001 follow-up.""I stand to make more money doing that sequel than I've ever made in my life,"" Foster was quoted as saying in 1999. ""But who cares, if it betrays Clarice?""""The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie,"" she elaborated in 2005. ""So I get to say, in a nice, dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot.""Amusingly, however, Foster was enticed to reprise her FBI agent character in 2017 for a satirical sketch on Stephen Colbert's late-night US talk show.You may also like:",20 May 2020,entertainment
Why Joe Rogan's exclusive Spotify deal matters,"Joe Rogan has signed an exclusive deal with Spotify, which will see his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, disappear from all other platforms.The multi-year deal is believed to be worth $100m (£82 million), according to the Wall Street Journal.Rogan's podcast, which is one of the most popular in the world, will arrive on the streaming giant on 1 September.It will then be housed there exclusively by the end of the year, and removed from all other platforms.""It will remain free, and it will be the exact same show,"" said Rogan. ""It's just a licensing deal, so Spotify won't have any creative control over the show.""They want me to just continue doing it the way I'm doing it right now.""I'm excited to have the support of the largest audio platform in the world and I hope you folks are there when we make the switch!""Joe Rogan is a US stand-up comedian and TV host-turned-provocateur, who launched his podcast in 2009 - in the early days of the medium.He invites a wide range of guests, including actors, musicians, comedians, politicians and conspiracy theorists on to the show, which has garnered a huge audience. Last year the podcast was downloaded 190 million times per month.Rogan has previously advocated for ""long-form media"" - and his own podcast episodes regularly run to two or three hours.The controversial entertainer also has 8.42 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, which has up until now shown the interviews in video form (this will stop when the new Spotify deal kicks in).But he has also attracted criticism - Rogan has been accused of making sexist, racist and transphobic comments in his podcasts.""The Joe Rogan Experience has become one of the internet's foremost vectors for anti-wokeness,"" wrote Justin Peters in Slate.In 2018, Rogan's show hit the headlines when the host shared a cannabis joint with Tesla boss Elon Musk, after which the company's stocks fell by 9%.Rogan has been credited as being an ""unlikely political influencer"" by the New York Times, due to his reach. In January, he informed his legions of followers that he would ""probably vote for Bernie"", referring to the then Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders, who received increased press coverage as a result.However, since Joe Biden became the party's presumptive nominee, Rogan has said he is more likely to vote for President Trump.The kind of figures involved in the deal are incredibly rare in the podcast world - and Rogan will now likely earn more money than most musicians on Spotify.""Joe Rogan just got paid the equivalent value of over 26 billion streams for a podcast licence,"" wrote Tom Gray, director of the royalties, music copyright and licensing society, PRS for Music.""A musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights."" added music writer Ted Gioia.Gioia suggested this means ""Spotify values Rogan more than any musician in the history of the world"".TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan predicted the deal could ""lead the way to others"", but noted that the exclusivity clause would leave many fans locked out.""It might do what Sky did for a lot of shows,"" he tweeted. ""Lift them up, but put them behind a wall that the culture mostly then ignores.""Although Rogan has said the podcast will still be free to access, Spotify will be hoping the increased traffic to its service will lead to a significant increase in subscriber numbers.It is generally difficult to make large amounts of money in the crowded world of podcasts. As most podcasts are free to download, many presenters and producers attempt to make money from endorsements and advertising. A platform-exclusive deal such as this is very rare.

Lord Hall: People have turned to BBC 'in their droves' during pandemic,"People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic.He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home. The BBC could lose £125m in revenue because of coronavirus, he added.Lord Hall also said he recognised the need for a ""big debate"" about the future of the BBC and the way it is funded.The director general, who is set to leave his role in the summer, said younger audiences had been coming back to the BBC during the lockdown, with shows such as Normal People becoming huge hits.The corporation said that 94% of the British public used the BBC in the third week of March when social distancing began in the UK - with 86% of younger people between the ages of 16-34 also accessing BBC content. Lord Hall also credited this success to its ""biggest ever educational programme"", as well the launch of Culture in Quarantine - an arts and culture service which Lord Hall says keeps ""the arts alive in people's homes and support the arts sector during challenging times"".He was pressed on plans to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel, four years after it was taken off air and moved online to save costs.Lord Hall said the initial plans had been a ""fantastic, creative success"" and showed ""the importance of developing our iPlayer, developing our sounds and making sure that our new services are in tip top position for young audiences to come to"".However, he acknowledged that the broadcaster could potentially lose £125m as a result of coronavirus, meaning it would have to spend ""wisely"" in future. The BBC is facing financial pressure after being forced to delay the end of the free TV licence scheme for all over-75s.It also had to postpone plans to cut 450 jobs, and said there was uncertainty around commercial revenues.Lord Hall said that he hopes in future, there will be a ""big debate"" about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the current charter comes to an end. He said: ""The question is, what's the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share.""I hope even when I've left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone.""It comes after a public consultation was launched by the government on whether failure to pay for a TV licence should stop being a criminal offence, with the BBC warning it would cost the corporation more than £1bn over five years.",24 May 2020,entertainment
UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale; one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment
