Glastonbury: BBC to air classic sets in festival's absence,"The BBC is to broadcast classic Glastonbury performances this year in the music festival's absence.Previous headline sets from Beyoncé, Adele, Coldplay, David Bowie and Jay-Z will be shown on BBC Two and BBC Four.A new pop-up channel will also appear on BBC iPlayer, which will feature more than 60 historic sets.This year's festival, which was due to feature Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar and Sir Paul McCartney, was cancelled amid the coronavirus pandemic.More than 200,000 people, including 135,000 ticket-holders, would have descended on Worthy Farm in Somerset if the festival had gone ahead from 25 to 28 June.Clara Amfo, Edith Bowman, Jo Whiley, Lauren Laverne and Mark Radcliffe will host four days of programming across the BBC.At the centre of the BBC coverage will be three 90-minute programmes on BBC Two, broadcast on Friday 26, Saturday 27 and Sunday 28 June.They will feature performances from Amy Winehouse, Arctic Monkeys, Blur, Dizzee Rascal, Lady Gaga, PJ Harvey, R.E.M. and The Rolling Stones.Additional programming on BBC Four will feature some of the most memorable acoustic performances filmed in the BBC compound at previous festivals - including Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa, Kano, Leon Bridges, Patti Smith, Richie Havens and Youssou N'Dour.Archive performances will also be played across BBC radio stations and available on the BBC Sounds app.Organiser Emily Eavis will be interviewed by Lauren Laverne on her BBC 6 Music show on Friday 26 June.Lorna Clarke, the controller of BBC Pop said: ""Even though Worthy Farm can't be full of thousands of music lovers this year, the BBC will celebrate with four days of memories and archive footage to give our audience a taste of the festival in their own homes.""Eavis added: ""There are so many memorable sets being played across the BBC over what would have been our 50th anniversary weekend.

UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale, one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment
The Joe Rogan Experience: Will Gompertz reviews episode #1470 with Elon Musk ★★★☆☆,"They used to say everybody had a book in them. Then it changed to everybody had a blog in them. Now, everybody has a podcast in them. And that's just where the book-blog-pod should stay in 99.9% of cases. But there are handful of people who have taken to podcasting like Luke Skywalker to a lightsaber and become masters of cyberspace broadcasting. Elizabeth Day has gone from journalist to novelist to prominent media figure with her How To Fail podcast. George The Poet has cut through with his meditative musings, while the footballer Peter Crouch has turned into a surprise comedy star with his laddish tales from the locker-room. In America - where the art of podcasting was honed with shows like Serial, This American Life and Radiolab - the medium has long had a seat at the top table of the entertainment business. As was made evident this week with the announcement that the Swedish streaming service Spotify had paid a huge sum of money - the Wall Street Journal reported the deal could be worth around $100 million (£82 million) - for exclusive rights to a Californian-based podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan is a famous personality in the US. He first made his name as a stand-up comic, then turned to acting, before hosting a TV show featuring wince-inducing dares, and between all this established himself as a respected mixed martial arts UFC commentator. He started his eponymous podcast in 2009 as a ""mates chatting"" sort of thing, which it basically still is, although some of his mates are now Senators and Harvard professors. Anyway, it works: the show is said to have over 190 million monthly downloads, which is a lot of listeners by any measure (it is also available for free on YouTube, for now).I visited his website to hear what all the fuss was about, and chose episode #1470 from a couple of weeks ago, in which Rogan chats to Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla car boss. He'd had Musk on the show before, offered him a puff on his joint (cannabis is legal in the state where the show is made), which Elon duly accepted, leading to headlines and a sharp drop in Tesla's share price. The episode I listened to didn't have any such incidents. The two men began by chewing the fat about Musk's newly-born baby, to whom the businessman and his partner had given a name that sounded like a line of code written by one of his company's boffs. Rogan was amused and enthusiastic as the conversation gently meandered towards the topic of connecting computers to our brains, a concept that appeared to enthral and appal the host in equal measure.Not so the quietly-spoken Musk, who considered the prospect of a ""whole brain interface"" where ""more of you would be in the cloud than in your body"", to be viable within decades. Don't worry if that seems like too long to wait, because he also thought if all went to plan, that in five years we won't have to talk anymore because we'll be able to communicate our unfettered thoughts through neural links. These were not small things to posit given the obvious ramifications, particularly for The Joe Rogan Experience: no talking, no podcast. But our host didn't seem concerned or particularly interested in interrogating the breezy claims his guest made with a matter-of-factness that equated to someone putting a live grenade in your hand and mentioning, by-the-by, it could be quite dangerous. That's not to say Rogan was disengaged. It's just that his natural curiosity tended to stop at wow without getting to why. Which is fine, that's the nature of the show: guests are allowed to talk as much and as long as they like, often for hours, with Rogan the interlocutor playing the role of everyman: a part he has nailed better than almost anyone else in the world of podcasts, if one was judging by numbers alone (downloads, YouTube views, Instagram followers etc.).He is, as they say nowadays, relatable. His listeners get him, like him; maybe even want to be him. He's not a show-pony, or a light-entertainment phoney: he's the all-American do it yourself modern man, tough but intelligent. Joe Rogan is the Bruce Springsteen of chat.The Boss has taken his brand global, whether Rogan can repeat the feat in the talk-show genre will be interesting to see. The two men have much in common. They share the same muscular male aesthetic, with a love of T-shirts and no BS. They're both from New Jersey. They both had troubled relationships with their fathers - Springsteen's dad was a bus driver, Rogan's a cop. And they both found fame as the front man on stage.Given the size of its investment, Spotify must be hoping Rogan can compete with Springsteen in terms of reach and appeal. I'm not so sure he can having listened to his show. Songs can be reinterpreted, meaning can morph and be personalised - less so with chat, which tends to be specific to the host and his or her culture. I quite enjoyed listening to his conversation with Musk, but I wouldn't download another show in a rush for entertainment's sake. It wasn't just because the entrepreneur could say almost anything without being challenged - there's a section about Covid-19 when I found my eyebrows rise while Joe's and Elon's were furrowed in agreement (I believe in previous episodes Rogan has been more sceptical). The main problem is my cultural reference points are different, I don't relate to Joe Rogan. I'm not interested in mixed martial arts or conspiracy theories or smoking weed or drinking hard liquor or camping or ""dumb things"". I don't care if a Tesla car can accelerate to 60 mph in under two seconds or want to hear what Elon Musk has to say to ""all the fools out there"" - another throwaway remark that went unchallenged.Nevertheless, the host clearly reflects the views and tastes of a vast number of American people, and has developed a format with which they can connect and hear his thoughts and those of his guests (male-skewed, judging by the recent roster). And that's why I will continue to download his show: Not to be amused but to be informed.  Listen to The Joe Rogan Experience and you hear America.

Claire Foy and Matt Smith to perform live in empty Old Vic theatre,"Claire Foy and Matt Smith will reunite in a socially-distanced play to be streamed from an empty Old Vic theatre.The pair co-starred in Netflix's The Crown before appearing together in Lungs at the London venue last year.They will reprise their roles as the couple in Duncan MacMillan's play for several live performances next month.Viewers will be asked to pay between £10-£65 to watch online. The Old Vic has warned it is in a ""seriously perilous"" financial position.Like all theatres, it has been shut since the lockdown began in mid-March. However, it is not eligible for Arts Council England's £160m emergency relief fund.""Significant support is urgently needed if we are to emerge from this crisis still able to deliver exciting entertainment and social benefit,"" the theatre said in a statement.The revival of Lungs will launch the famous theatre's Old Vic: In Camera series, which will feature other well-known actors in rehearsed play-readings - all streamed online.""This series is both an exciting creative experiment and also crucial in igniting the box office now all our usual channels of revenue have been entirely wiped out and we fight to preserve this beloved theatre for our audiences,"" the statement said.Each performance of Lungs will be limited to 1,000 viewers - mimicking the venue's actual capacity.Virtual theatre-goers will select a seat and ticket price as normal, but will in reality all have the same view.Many theatre companies have released shows online in recent months - but they were either recorded before lockdown, or have been filmed in actors' homes, rather than in the empty venues themselves.Entertainment venues could potentially reopen to audiences from 4 July at the earliest, according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's three-stage plan to reopen the country.But that date rests on a lot of things, not least whether it will be financially viable to reopen if social distancing is still in place.Sir Cameron Mackintosh recently told the BBC that West End and Broadway theatres are unlikely to be able to stage musicals until early next year.On Wednesday, Sir Cameron and Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's planned 14-month tour of The Phantom of the Opera - which was forced to shut after its opening night in Leicester in March - was called off completely.A statement said: ""The great uncertainty around the duration of social distancing requirements and the perilous financial situation in which many regional theatres find themselves have conspired to make re-routing an entire major tour like Phantom impossible for some time as so many existing tours are needing to reschedule.""",27 May 2020,entertainment
California sues Disney and CBS over Criminal Minds harassment claims,"A cinematographer on TV show Criminal Minds was allowed to grope male crew members by employers who condoned his conduct, a US legal action alleges.Gregory St Johns is accused of touching multiple men and retaliating against those who spurned his advances.The Disney Company, CBS and Mr St Johns are among the defendants being sued by California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH).Mr St Johns was fired in 2018 after crew members' complaints became public.According to court documents published by the Deadline website, Mr St Johns engaged in a pattern of ""sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation"" for 14 years.He is accused of touching, kissing and caressing ""numerous men"". It is alleged that his employers had ""actual and constructive knowledge"" of Mr St Johns' ""abusive"" conduct yet allowed it to continue ""unchecked"".""No necessary steps to prevent sex-based harassment and discrimination were taken over the years, nor were appropriate corrective actions,"" the legal action continues.""Instead, the executives fired anyone who resisted or who tacitly evaded St Johns' advances or abuse."" The legal case says more than a dozen men were fired at Mr St Johns' request.The DFEH is seeking damages for any victims in a legal action that names several individual producers as defendants.CBS, Disney and Mr St Johns have yet to comment, while the Disney-owned ABC Signature Studios said it would ""defend the asserted claims vigorously"".Criminal Minds, a police procedural about the workings of the FBI's Behavioural Analysis Unit, was a CBS-ABC co-production that first aired in 2005.Mandy Patinkin, Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Love Hewitt were among the many actors to appear in the show prior to its cancellation earlier this year.",27 May 2020,entertainment
