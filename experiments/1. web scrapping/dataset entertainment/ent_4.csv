The Night Watch: Will Gompertz reviews the Rijksmuseum's high tech photo ★★★★★,"At 9am on Tuesday the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam posted an image of Rembrandt's The Night Watch (1642) on its website. Nothing particularly unusual about that, you might think. After all, the museum frequently uploads pictures of its masterpieces from Dutch Golden Age. But there was something about this particular photo that made it stand out just like the little girl in a gold dress in Rembrandt's famous group portrait of local civic guardsmen. The web image presents the painting unframed on a dark grey background. It looks sharp and well-lit but not exceptional in terms of photography. Until, that is, you click on it, at which point you're zoomed in a bit closer. Click again and you're propelled towards the outstretched hand of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq. Another click, and you're face-to-face with the leader of this group of not-so-merry-men. Once more, and you can see the glint in his eye and the texture of his ginger beard. At no point does the image start to pixilate or distort, it's pin-sharp throughout. And it remains so as you continue to click, getting further and further into the painting until the Captain's paint-cracked eyeball is the size of a fist, and you realise that tiny glint you first saw isn't the result of one dab of Rembrandt's brush, but four separate applications, each loaded with a slightly different shade of paint. And then you stop and think: Crikey, Rembrandt actually used four different colours to paint a miniscule light effect in the eye of one of the many life-sized protagonists featured in this group portrait, which probably wouldn't be seen by anybody anyway. Or, maybe, this visionary 17th Century Dutchman foresaw a future where the early experiments with camera obscura techniques, in which he might have dabbled, would eventually lead to a photographic technology capable of recording a visual representation of his giant canvas to a level of detail beyond the eyesight of even the artist himself! It is, quite frankly, amazing.  For instance, I've always liked the ghostly dog that turns and snarls at the drummer situated at the edge of the painting. I'd assumed the hound was unfinished and therefore unloved by Rembrandt, but now I can see by zooming in that the artist not only gave the dog a stylish collar, but also added a gold pendant with a tiny flash of red paint to echo the colour of the trousers worn by the drummer. Clearly, Rembrandt was pro-dogs.As always there is artifice behind the art, as you will see within moments of zooming into The Night Watch. It quickly becomes apparent that Rembrandt first created his wonderfully dynamic composition, and then fine-tuned it as he went along. You will spot lots of small shadowy corrections (pentimenti) he made, such as the top of drummer's stick on the far right, or on the index finger of the Ensign holding the Troop's flag aloft. There is artifice in the photograph, too. It is not a single image as it appears, but a composite of 528 individual digital photographs that have been seamlessly stitched together to give us a completely new view of one the most famous paintings in western art.Let's zoom out for a moment. Rembrandt signed, dated and called his painting:  Officers and Men of the Amsterdam Kloveniers Militia, the Company of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq.It was a commissioned portrait by the Kloveniers Militia (a sort of Dad's Army of locals) to hang in their HQ. Those featured (probably 18 members originally) each paid to be included. Capt Cocq takes centre stage, with his trusty Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch to his side. The men gathered behind them are carrying an assortment of weapons with which to defend their neighbourhood. Muskets (Klover) were their speciality, a point Rembrandt illustrates with a surreal sequence running left to right across the picture featuring three musketeers. The first, dressed in red with white collar and cuffs, is loading his musket with gunpowder. The second, a young boy, partially obscured by Cocq's right arm, fires his gun, ruffling the feathers of Ruytenburch's hat but not the man himself, who one has to assume is stone deaf. And then, there's the third, an older man also dressed in red, blowing away the spent powder from the fired gun. The young girl in the gold dress is not a member of the militia, but is there as their shining symbolic mascot. The upturned feet of the dead chicken hanging from her belt represent the Kloveniers' golden claw emblem. The painting initially hung with several other huge group portraits, giving visitors to the troops' inner sanctum the sense of being surrounded by local muscle. It was subsequently moved in 1715 to the Town Hall on the Dam (now the Royal Palace), where it was trimmed on all four sides to fit between the doors. It was first called The Night Watch in 1897, when the varnish applied to protect the paint had become so old and stained the picture looked like a nocturnal scene. That layer of varnish was removed long ago in one of the 25 or more restorations and treatments The Night Watch has undergone over the years. The most memorable being in 1975 after a visitor to the museum attacked the painting with a knife, causing severe damage, traces of which you can see when you zoom in on the new composite photograph: An act of art historical sleuthing which is the digital photo's primary purpose. The 44.8 Gigapixel image was created for the Rijksmuseum's conservation department, which is currently embarked upon the most exhaustive facelift The Night Watch has probably ever endured.  It enables the team of 12 to look right into the picture without using microscopes, in order to see what work needs to be done. A huge amount is the answer. Zoom in and you'll detect plenty of cracked paint, which is to be expected. But zero in on the Captain's and Lieutenant's faces and you will notice they're covered in blackheads. That's not because they didn't know one end of a bath from the other - they were sophisticated chaps - it is probably down to aging white paint particles, the tops of which have broken off to reveal a dark inner. There are thousands of these pinprick blemishes, all of which conservators should be able to reverse, bringing an even greater liveliness to an already lively painting. The Night Watch is an incredible work of art. Soon, you will be able to stand in front of it once again when the Rijksmuseum re-opens on the 1 June (caveat: there will be vastly reduced number of admissions, and The Night Watch is currently encased in a glass box - still visible but not as approachable).  And if and when you do see it for real, you will immediately notice Rembrandt's exaggerated use of light and shade to create a sense of drama, aided and abetted by an all-action composition emphasised by teaming diagonal lines. The Night Watch is as close to theatre as a painting can get. As the director of the Rijksmuseum said, it is a school photo taken before everybody is lined up in order (it shows Capt. Cocq instructing Lt. Ruytenburch to bring his men to attention). It captures a moment of movement and mayhem.You can see that when in front of the canvas. But what you are not, when you're at home, you can now see the same sense of chaos in the way Rembrandt painted his masterpiece, made when he was at the peak of his fame, just at the time his beloved wife was dying and his life took a turn for the worse. The further you look into it the greater the mess appears to be. Splodges of impasto paint here, unfinished transitions there. It's a mixture of early Rembrandt tautness and late Rembrandt looseness. If you thought Van Gogh or Jackson Pollock invented expressionistic painting, you'll think again when you've zoomed into The Night Watch. It is a sight to behold. A magnificent sight, which extends our knowledge of a truly great work of art, whether you're an old timer or a first timer. New technology is often used to try to jazz up old art, which is generally a bad idea. But, the Rijksmuseum is using technology to increase our understanding and appreciation of a Golden Age great, and that is a good idea. As you can see.

Astrid Kirchherr: Beatles photographer dies aged 81,"Astrid Kirchherr, the German photographer whose early shots of The Beatles helped turn them into icons, has died aged 81.She took the first photo of the band in Hamburg in 1960, and is credited with helping develop their visual style.Her death was announced by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, who said she died in the city on Wednesday following a short illness.""Her gift to the Beatles was immeasurable,"" he wrote on Twitter.Kirchherr first came across the band when she visited a nightclub in her native Hamburg where they were playing. ""It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing,"" she later told Beatles biographer Bob Spitz. ""My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them.""She began dating Stuart Sutcliffe, the original bassist in the band, and even cut his hair into the famous mop top style that the group came to be associated with.The couple were engaged shortly after, but Sutcliffe died of a brain haemorrhage in 1962 aged just 21.""He was, and still is, the love of my life,"" Kirchherr told NPR in 2010.Kirchherr, who married twice but had no children, remained friends with the band after Sutcliffe's death and photographed them throughout the 1960s.In 2010, a selection of her images went on display in Liverpool. They were also released in a book entitled Astrid Kirchherr, A Retrospective.The previously unseen photographs included shots of The Beatles on holiday in Tenerife as well as some from the making of their film A Hard Day's Night in 1964.In her later years, Kirchherr worked as a stylist and interior designer, and also opened a photography shop in Hamburg.",15 May 2020,entertainment
Pretty Things frontman Phil May dies aged 75,"Phil May, the frontman of The Pretty Things, has died aged 75 after suffering complications from emergency hip surgery.A representative of the rock 'n' roll band confirmed he died on Friday morning at a Kings Lynn hospital.May had fallen off his bicycle earlier in the week.""Very sad news, he was a very talented guy and he will be sorely missed. I'm shocked,"" tweeted Kinks guitarist Dave Davies. The Pretty Things' 1968 album SF Sorrow is credited as one of the first real rock opera concept albums.They were cited as an influence by a wide range of artists from David Bowie to Jimi Hendrix to Kasabian.Originally from Dartford, Kent, May formed the band in 1963 with guitarist Dick Taylor, a former bass player with an early incarnation of The Rolling Stones, and both bands were an integral part of the London blues-rock explosion.As his music developed in a more progressive psych-rock direction in the late 60s, singer and lyricist May became a leading countercultural figure, known for his long hair, drug-taking and bisexuality.""By the time The Pretty Things hit the TV screens, I was used to being abused and spat at and getting into punch-ups, because it had happened when we were art students,"" he recalled to The Guardian in 2018.""We'd done our apprenticeship at being outsiders.""In 1969, the band appeared in What's Good for the Goose, a bizarre sex comedy film, starring Norman Wisdom.Blur guitarist Graham Coxon paid tribute to May on Friday afternoon, directing his Twitter followers to the The Pretty Things' 1970 track Cries From The Midnight Circus.Singer Edwyn Collins pointed to their aforementioned seminal album, which he described as ""so great"".DJ Gary Crowley also said he was ""blasting Rosalyn across the flat in memory"" of May.He had been in poor health when The Pretty Things played a ""Final Bow"" farewell concert in December 2018, where they were joined on-stage by the likes of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and Sir Van Morrison.Their last album, Sweet Pretty Things (Are in Bed Now, of Course...) arrived in 2015.May is survived by his son, Paris May, his daughter, Sorrel May, and his partner, Colin Graham.",15 May 2020,entertainment

The track, which topped the UK charts and set them on their way to fame, went on to sell nearly 6m copies.Speaking later on the night, Bjorn Ulvaeus from the band said he found it ""hard to believe"" that was where it began for them all those years ago.The shortlist for the programme included Eurovision classics from the likes of Netta, Bucks Fizz, Conchita Wurst and Gina G.But it was Agnetha, Anni-Frid, Benny and Bjorn who ultimately triumphed, with their musical metaphor about the joys of surrendering to love.End of Youtube post  by AbbaVEVOThe 19-strong song list was compiled by Eurovision experts and broadcasters, including Rylan Clark-Neal, Scott Mills, Ken Bruce, Adele Roberts and Mel Giedroyc, as well as former UK acts SuRie and Nicki French.Presenter Graham Norton upheld the tradition of raising a glass to the late Sir Terry Wogan, who hosted the contest for nearly 30 years.""We couldn't deny you your Eurovision fix,"" he declared.The programme also showcased what would have been the UK entry this year - James Newman's My Last Breath - and Norton spoke to the singer via video link.Newman said he was ""pretty gutted"" and ""had to have a few minutes to myself"" when he found out the contest had been cancelled.He said the staging had already been planned and showed an image of an underwater scene leading down from some steps.Newman added that his favourite Eurovision entry this year was Iceland's - it was one of the favourites to win had the competition gone ahead, according to recent Spotify streaming figures.Later on on Saturday evening, the BBC also joined with other European broadcasters for Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light, to honour all 41 songs which would have competed this year. Some of this year's songs would have been eliminated at the semi-finals, where the entrants are normally whittled down to 26 but the semis were also cancelled.The event was hosted from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where the contest was due to take place, while Norton popped up again as the UK's commentator, and acts appeared in various forms from across the continent.1. Another Swedish act's tributeMåns Zelmerlöw sang an acoustic version of Heroes, his winning song from 2015, in homage to health workers during the coronavirus pandemic.End of Youtube post  by Eurovision Song Contest2. Fans answered Ireland's (video) callDouble Eurovision winner, Ireland's Johnny Logan, was joined by scores of fans via video-link for a rendition of his most relevantly-titled track, What's Another Year.3. Love shone its light, not once but twiceThe Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra joined forces (via the wonders of modern technology) to perform an instrumental version of the UK's 1997-winning Love Shine a Light, by Katrina and the Waves, as iconic music venues around the world lit up.This was certainly a high point for another former UK contestant SuRie, who said she had been left ""broken"" by the performance… in a good way.The track got another airing for the show's finale, but this time with the lyrics too, as performers from all countries sang along in unison.End of Youtube post 2 by Eurovision Song Contest4. There were FIVE Daði Freyr PéturssonsIceland's eccentric performer urged us all to ""stay healthy"" and ""stay fabulous"" with the help of a barbershop quartet, comprised of different digital versions of himself, all wearing the same sweater bearing an image of, yep, you guessed it... him again.TV critic Scott Bryan, for one, enjoyed it.5. A socially-distanced 'mass' gathering took placeMichael Schulte, Germany's entrant in 2018, and 2014 Dutch act The Common Linnets came together for a socially-distanced and fairly biblical looking grand church service-style rendition of Nicole's 1982 winning song Ein Bisschen Frieden.End of Youtube post 3 by Eurovision Song Contest6. Conchita went commandoThe Austrian singer and drag act Conchita Wurst, who won in 2014, confessed that the ""most beautiful"" part of the coronavirus lockdown was the fact, ""I hardly wear any underwear and I love it so much"".7. Graham Norton got delayedThe UK broadcaster admitted, ""there's no denying this is a very odd programme"" - referring to the lack of an actual competition this year, for the first time since the contest began in 1956.It got even odder as he had to take part in a live two-way chat with the Dutch hosts, with a bit of a delay. ""That was awkward,"" he joked, but he also said the show as a whole had ""real emotion"".8. Bjorn was 'happy' to forget about you know what for a wee while Abba were the winners who took it all in the earlier BBC poll, and there was a rare TV appearance from the aforementioned Bjorn in the Shine A Light show.After recounting a sweet tale about the time his grandson Albert first realised his grandad was a Eurovision pop star, he described the contest as one of the most ""genuinely joyous events of the TV year"" which ""allows you to escape and be happy and even forget about the coronavirus for a little while"".End of Youtube post 4 by Eurovision Song ContestThe show featured messages of love and support from all of the acts who would have featured in the competition. Some viewers though, it seems, would have preferred more action and less well-wishing.""I miss when Eurovision was fun,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""A chance to escape everything else. Yes the world is in a terrible place but the title is Shine a Light, not doom.""""They have badly judged what we all wanted,"" offered another. ""We wanted a party, even a Zoom party would have done, but this is a bit depressing.Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James, however, thought the show's producers hit all the right notes.""Don't know about anyone else but I'm pretty emotional watching this,"" she posted.None of the 2020 songs will be carried over to next year. Instead, countries will select new entrants for the 2021 contest. Several countries - including Greece, Spain and Bulgaria - have confirmed they will send the same acts next year to give the artists a second chance, but they will have to perform different songs.Currently, there's no word on whether the UK's 2020 entrant James Newman will be chosen for the 2021 contest, although he has said he ""absolutely"" wants to represent his country again.It was confirmed that Rotterdam, which missed out this year, would indeed be allowed to host the show in 2021 instead.",16 May 2020,entertainment

The Night Watch: Will Gompertz reviews the Rijksmuseum's high tech photo ★★★★★,"At 9am on Tuesday the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam posted an image of Rembrandt's The Night Watch (1642) on its website. Nothing particularly unusual about that, you might think. After all, the museum frequently uploads pictures of its masterpieces from Dutch Golden Age. But there was something about this particular photo that made it stand out just like the little girl in a gold dress in Rembrandt's famous group portrait of local civic guardsmen. The web image presents the painting unframed on a dark grey background. It looks sharp and well-lit but not exceptional in terms of photography. Until, that is, you click on it, at which point you're zoomed in a bit closer. Click again and you're propelled towards the outstretched hand of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq. Another click, and you're face-to-face with the leader of this group of not-so-merry-men. Once more, and you can see the glint in his eye and the texture of his ginger beard. At no point does the image start to pixilate or distort, it's pin-sharp throughout. And it remains so as you continue to click, getting further and further into the painting until the Captain's paint-cracked eyeball is the size of a fist, and you realise that tiny glint you first saw isn't the result of one dab of Rembrandt's brush, but four separate applications, each loaded with a slightly different shade of paint. And then you stop and think: Crikey, Rembrandt actually used four different colours to paint a miniscule light effect in the eye of one of the many life-sized protagonists featured in this group portrait, which probably wouldn't be seen by anybody anyway. Or, maybe, this visionary 17th Century Dutchman foresaw a future where the early experiments with camera obscura techniques, in which he might have dabbled, would eventually lead to a photographic technology capable of recording a visual representation of his giant canvas to a level of detail beyond the eyesight of even the artist himself! It is, quite frankly, amazing.  For instance, I've always liked the ghostly dog that turns and snarls at the drummer situated at the edge of the painting. I'd assumed the hound was unfinished and therefore unloved by Rembrandt, but now I can see by zooming in that the artist not only gave the dog a stylish collar, but also added a gold pendant with a tiny flash of red paint to echo the colour of the trousers worn by the drummer. Clearly, Rembrandt was pro-dogs.As always there is artifice behind the art, as you will see within moments of zooming into The Night Watch. It quickly becomes apparent that Rembrandt first created his wonderfully dynamic composition, and then fine-tuned it as he went along. You will spot lots of small shadowy corrections (pentimenti) he made, such as the top of drummer's stick on the far right, or on the index finger of the Ensign holding the Troop's flag aloft. There is artifice in the photograph, too. It is not a single image as it appears, but a composite of 528 individual digital photographs that have been seamlessly stitched together to give us a completely new view of one the most famous paintings in western art.Let's zoom out for a moment. Rembrandt signed, dated and called his painting:  Officers and Men of the Amsterdam Kloveniers Militia, the Company of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq.It was a commissioned portrait by the Kloveniers Militia (a sort of Dad's Army of locals) to hang in their HQ. Those featured (probably 18 members originally) each paid to be included. Capt Cocq takes centre stage, with his trusty Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch to his side. The men gathered behind them are carrying an assortment of weapons with which to defend their neighbourhood. Muskets (Klover) were their speciality, a point Rembrandt illustrates with a surreal sequence running left to right across the picture featuring three musketeers. The first, dressed in red with white collar and cuffs, is loading his musket with gunpowder. The second, a young boy, partially obscured by Cocq's right arm, fires his gun, ruffling the feathers of Ruytenburch's hat but not the man himself, who one has to assume is stone deaf. And then, there's the third, an older man also dressed in red, blowing away the spent powder from the fired gun. The young girl in the gold dress is not a member of the militia, but is there as their shining symbolic mascot. The upturned feet of the dead chicken hanging from her belt represent the Kloveniers' golden claw emblem. The painting initially hung with several other huge group portraits, giving visitors to the troops' inner sanctum the sense of being surrounded by local muscle. It was subsequently moved in 1715 to the Town Hall on the Dam (now the Royal Palace), where it was trimmed on all four sides to fit between the doors. It was first called The Night Watch in 1897, when the varnish applied to protect the paint had become so old and stained the picture looked like a nocturnal scene. That layer of varnish was removed long ago in one of the 25 or more restorations and treatments The Night Watch has undergone over the years. The most memorable being in 1975 after a visitor to the museum attacked the painting with a knife, causing severe damage, traces of which you can see when you zoom in on the new composite photograph: An act of art historical sleuthing which is the digital photo's primary purpose. The 44.8 Gigapixel image was created for the Rijksmuseum's conservation department, which is currently embarked upon the most exhaustive facelift The Night Watch has probably ever endured.  It enables the team of 12 to look right into the picture without using microscopes, in order to see what work needs to be done. A huge amount is the answer. Zoom in and you'll detect plenty of cracked paint, which is to be expected. But zero in on the Captain's and Lieutenant's faces and you will notice they're covered in blackheads. That's not because they didn't know one end of a bath from the other - they were sophisticated chaps - it is probably down to aging white paint particles, the tops of which have broken off to reveal a dark inner. There are thousands of these pinprick blemishes, all of which conservators should be able to reverse, bringing an even greater liveliness to an already lively painting. The Night Watch is an incredible work of art. Soon, you will be able to stand in front of it once again when the Rijksmuseum re-opens on the 1 June (caveat: there will be vastly reduced number of admissions, and The Night Watch is currently encased in a glass box - still visible but not as approachable).  And if and when you do see it for real, you will immediately notice Rembrandt's exaggerated use of light and shade to create a sense of drama, aided and abetted by an all-action composition emphasised by teaming diagonal lines. The Night Watch is as close to theatre as a painting can get. As the director of the Rijksmuseum said, it is a school photo taken before everybody is lined up in order (it shows Capt. Cocq instructing Lt. Ruytenburch to bring his men to attention). It captures a moment of movement and mayhem.You can see that when in front of the canvas. But what you are not, when you're at home, you can now see the same sense of chaos in the way Rembrandt painted his masterpiece, made when he was at the peak of his fame, just at the time his beloved wife was dying and his life took a turn for the worse. The further you look into it the greater the mess appears to be. Splodges of impasto paint here, unfinished transitions there. It's a mixture of early Rembrandt tautness and late Rembrandt looseness. If you thought Van Gogh or Jackson Pollock invented expressionistic painting, you'll think again when you've zoomed into The Night Watch. It is a sight to behold. A magnificent sight, which extends our knowledge of a truly great work of art, whether you're an old timer or a first timer. New technology is often used to try to jazz up old art, which is generally a bad idea. But, the Rijksmuseum is using technology to increase our understanding and appreciation of a Golden Age great, and that is a good idea. As you can see.

Astrid Kirchherr: Beatles photographer dies aged 81,"Astrid Kirchherr, the German photographer whose early shots of The Beatles helped turn them into icons, has died aged 81.She took the first photo of the band in Hamburg in 1960, and is credited with helping develop their visual style.Her death was announced by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, who said she died in the city on Wednesday following a short illness.""Her gift to the Beatles was immeasurable,"" he wrote on Twitter.Kirchherr first came across the band when she visited a nightclub in her native Hamburg where they were playing. ""It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing,"" she later told Beatles biographer Bob Spitz. ""My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them.""She began dating Stuart Sutcliffe, the original bassist in the band, and even cut his hair into the famous mop top style that the group came to be associated with.The couple were engaged shortly after, but Sutcliffe died of a brain haemorrhage in 1962 aged just 21.""He was, and still is, the love of my life,"" Kirchherr told NPR in 2010.Kirchherr, who married twice but had no children, remained friends with the band after Sutcliffe's death and photographed them throughout the 1960s.In 2010, a selection of her images went on display in Liverpool. They were also released in a book entitled Astrid Kirchherr, A Retrospective.The previously unseen photographs included shots of The Beatles on holiday in Tenerife as well as some from the making of their film A Hard Day's Night in 1964.In her later years, Kirchherr worked as a stylist and interior designer, and also opened a photography shop in Hamburg.",15 May 2020,entertainment
Pretty Things frontman Phil May dies aged 75,"Phil May, the frontman of The Pretty Things, has died aged 75 after suffering complications from emergency hip surgery.A representative of the rock 'n' roll band confirmed he died on Friday morning at a Kings Lynn hospital.May had fallen off his bicycle earlier in the week.""Very sad news, he was a very talented guy and he will be sorely missed. I'm shocked,"" tweeted Kinks guitarist Dave Davies. The Pretty Things' 1968 album SF Sorrow is credited as one of the first real rock opera concept albums.They were cited as an influence by a wide range of artists from David Bowie to Jimi Hendrix to Kasabian.Originally from Dartford, Kent, May formed the band in 1963 with guitarist Dick Taylor, a former bass player with an early incarnation of The Rolling Stones, and both bands were an integral part of the London blues-rock explosion.As his music developed in a more progressive psych-rock direction in the late 60s, singer and lyricist May became a leading countercultural figure, known for his long hair, drug-taking and bisexuality.""By the time The Pretty Things hit the TV screens, I was used to being abused and spat at and getting into punch-ups, because it had happened when we were art students,"" he recalled to The Guardian in 2018.""We'd done our apprenticeship at being outsiders.""In 1969, the band appeared in What's Good for the Goose, a bizarre sex comedy film, starring Norman Wisdom.Blur guitarist Graham Coxon paid tribute to May on Friday afternoon, directing his Twitter followers to the The Pretty Things' 1970 track Cries From The Midnight Circus.Singer Edwyn Collins pointed to their aforementioned seminal album, which he described as ""so great"".DJ Gary Crowley also said he was ""blasting Rosalyn across the flat in memory"" of May.He had been in poor health when The Pretty Things played a ""Final Bow"" farewell concert in December 2018, where they were joined on-stage by the likes of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and Sir Van Morrison.Their last album, Sweet Pretty Things (Are in Bed Now, of Course...) arrived in 2015.May is survived by his son, Paris May, his daughter, Sorrel May, and his partner, Colin Graham.",15 May 2020,entertainment

Astrid Kirchherr: Beatles photographer dies aged 81,"Astrid Kirchherr, the German photographer whose early shots of The Beatles helped turn them into icons, has died aged 81.She took the first photo of the band in Hamburg in 1960, and is credited with helping develop their visual style.Her death was announced by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, who said she died in the city on Wednesday following a short illness.""Her gift to the Beatles was immeasurable,"" he wrote on Twitter.Kirchherr first came across the band when she visited a nightclub in her native Hamburg where they were playing. ""It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing,"" she later told Beatles biographer Bob Spitz. ""My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them.""She began dating Stuart Sutcliffe, the original bassist in the band, and even cut his hair into the famous mop top style that the group came to be associated with.The couple were engaged shortly after, but Sutcliffe died of a brain haemorrhage in 1962 aged just 21.""He was, and still is, the love of my life,"" Kirchherr told NPR in 2010.Kirchherr, who married twice but had no children, remained friends with the band after Sutcliffe's death and photographed them throughout the 1960s.In 2010, a selection of her images went on display in Liverpool. They were also released in a book entitled Astrid Kirchherr, A Retrospective.The previously unseen photographs included shots of The Beatles on holiday in Tenerife as well as some from the making of their film A Hard Day's Night in 1964.In her later years, Kirchherr worked as a stylist and interior designer, and also opened a photography shop in Hamburg.",15 May 2020,entertainment
Pretty Things frontman Phil May dies aged 75,"Phil May, the frontman of The Pretty Things, has died aged 75 after suffering complications from emergency hip surgery.A representative of the rock 'n' roll band confirmed he died on Friday morning at a Kings Lynn hospital.May had fallen off his bicycle earlier in the week.""Very sad news, he was a very talented guy and he will be sorely missed. I'm shocked,"" tweeted Kinks guitarist Dave Davies. The Pretty Things' 1968 album SF Sorrow is credited as one of the first real rock opera concept albums.They were cited as an influence by a wide range of artists from David Bowie to Jimi Hendrix to Kasabian.Originally from Dartford, Kent, May formed the band in 1963 with guitarist Dick Taylor, a former bass player with an early incarnation of The Rolling Stones, and both bands were an integral part of the London blues-rock explosion.As his music developed in a more progressive psych-rock direction in the late 60s, singer and lyricist May became a leading countercultural figure, known for his long hair, drug-taking and bisexuality.""By the time The Pretty Things hit the TV screens, I was used to being abused and spat at and getting into punch-ups, because it had happened when we were art students,"" he recalled to The Guardian in 2018.""We'd done our apprenticeship at being outsiders.""In 1969, the band appeared in What's Good for the Goose, a bizarre sex comedy film, starring Norman Wisdom.Blur guitarist Graham Coxon paid tribute to May on Friday afternoon, directing his Twitter followers to the The Pretty Things' 1970 track Cries From The Midnight Circus.Singer Edwyn Collins pointed to their aforementioned seminal album, which he described as ""so great"".DJ Gary Crowley also said he was ""blasting Rosalyn across the flat in memory"" of May.He had been in poor health when The Pretty Things played a ""Final Bow"" farewell concert in December 2018, where they were joined on-stage by the likes of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and Sir Van Morrison.Their last album, Sweet Pretty Things (Are in Bed Now, of Course...) arrived in 2015.May is survived by his son, Paris May, his daughter, Sorrel May, and his partner, Colin Graham.",15 May 2020,entertainment
Dame Vera Lynn breaks her own chart record,"Dame Vera Lynn has become the oldest singer to score a UK top 40 album, beating her own record.The 103-year-old star's greatest hits collection, titled 100, re-entered the chart at number 30 on Friday.Dame Vera became the first centenarian to chart when it was first released in 2017, reaching number three.The upsurge in popularity for the album coincided with the 75th anniversary of VE Day, which marked the end of World War Two in Europe.The BBC's anniversary programme ended with key workers and singers like Katherine Jenkins and Beverley Knight accompanying a recording of Dame Vera performing We'll Meet Again.End of Youtube post  by BBCDame Vera, who became known as ""the forces' sweetheart"" for entertaining troops during the conflict, also sent a message that while people may apart due to lockdown measures, ""hope remains even in the most difficult of times"".It's been quite a time of late for elderly chart stars, following the success of Captain Tom Moore, who became the oldest person ever to score a number one single in the UK in April.At the age of 99, his cover of You'll Never Walk Alone, alongside crooner Michael Ball, raised money for the NHS Charities Together fund.This week, The D-Day Darlings, a wartime-style act who found fame on Britain's Got Talent in 2018, are at number five on the album chart.Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia remained the number one album for a fourth consecutive week.In the singles chart, US rapper DaBaby came of age by securing his first number one with Rockstar.The track, which features Roddy Ricch, knocked Drake's Toosie Slide off top spot, thanks largely to its use in a viral dance challenge on TikTok.",15 May 2020,entertainment
Music royalties reach a record high - but a storm is coming,"Musicians and songwriters in the UK received a record amount of money last year, but the loss of live music poses a major threat to income in 2020.The warning was issued by PRS for Music, the body that makes sure 145,000 songwriters, composers and publishers in the UK are paid when their music is played or performed around the world.The organisation collected a record £810m last year, a rise of 8.7%.But it said Covid-19 would result in an ""inevitable decline"" in 2020 and 2021.""Even though we had a record-breaking year, we know very well that we're in unprecedented, unpredictable times,"" chief executive Andrea Martin told the BBC.Revenues from ""live music and public performance will be hit"" not just in 2020 but in 2021, as international payments often take time to trickle down, she said.""There will be a downfall,"" she added. ""But by how much and by what per cent... your guess is just as good as mine.""The situation will hit smaller acts, many of whom were already struggling before the pandemic, the hardest.PRS processed 18.8 trillion ""performances"" of music last year, including streams, downloads, radio and TV broadcasts, and music played in pubs, clubs, hairdressers and concert venues. UK songwriters contributed to many of the year's most-played hits, including like Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi, Old Town Road by Lil Nas X and Don't Call Me Up by Mabel.Live music generated £54m in royalties, up £15m since 2018. Revenues were boosted by major tours from the Spice Girls, Sir Elton John, Ed Sheeran and the return of Glastonbury after a fallow year in 2018.But with an entire summer of festivals cancelled and dozens of major tours postponed until 2021, that figure will be impossible to recreate in next year's results.Last week, UK Music revealed the contribution of live music to the UK economy is set to drop in 2020 from an estimated £1.1bn to £200m, describing it as a ""catastrophic"" blow to the industry.Meanwhile, the Ivors Academy of songwriters and composers said it anticipated a loss of £25,000 per member over a six-month period.The lockdown also means songwriters will lose out on royalties gathered when their music is played in shops, cinemas, pubs, clubs and restaurants. In 2019, that figure was £168.2m.There is some good news, however. Royalties from music streaming rose 22.1% to £155m, while the money generated from music on video-on-demand services like Amazon and Netflix increased 47.5% to £17.7m.Early figures suggest more people have taken out streaming subscriptions during the lockdown, which may provide a small counterweight to the loss of live music.But many musicians have noted that the money they receive from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon is not enough to sustain a career.Tom Gray from indie band Gomez recently shared a chart, originally compiled by The Trichordist, showing how many streams artists require to make a living in the UK.On YouTube, a song would have to be played 7,267 times to generate £8.72 - or one hour of minimum wage. On Spotify, the figure was 3,114 streams, and on Apple Music 1,615 streams.That has led to a campaign, #BrokenRecord, seeking a more equitable system of distributing streaming money.Spearheaded by the Ivors Academy and the Musicians' Union, it is calling for a new system, where your subscription fee is distributed to the artists you actually listen to - rather than going into a central pot, where money is split between the most-streamed songs on a percentage basis.""This is what the consumer wants,"" said Graham Davies of the Ivors Academy, who is calling for a government-backed review.""They want their £9.99 a month to be paid to the artists, performers, songwriters and composers of the music they love.""In the meantime, the PRS Emergency Relief Fund has raised more than £2.1m to help members who have lost income as a result of Covid-19. Martin says 1,600 songwriters have applied for assistance in the last week alone.Another £5m fund, set up by the charity Help Musicians, ran out of cash within a week after being launched in March.Trade body UK Music has subsequently called on the government to set up a new taskforce to revive the music industry as it navigates the pandemic.",14 May 2020,entertainment
'We're clinging on' - theatre leaders discuss lockdown turmoil,"Theatres will be among the last places to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown is lifted, meaning venues, actors and crews are fearing for their futures.The appeal of the theatre - cramming into an enclosed space with hundreds of strangers to share a communal experience - has suddenly become its greatest risk.Box office takings have dried up virtually overnight. Reopening with social distancing will not make financial sense. One venue, the Nuffield in Southampton, has already gone into administration.Below, four artistic directors discuss how and when they might reopen, and warn of dire consequences if income and funding dry up.The theatre industry is badly wounded, according to Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah's analogy. ""Right now we're at the tourniquet stage,"" he says. ""We're trying to stem the bleeding.""Then we're going to have to stand up, and then we're going to have to run. And we're going to need help at each stage in order to get back to - not even the way it was, but to get back to something that is sustainable and safe.""He believes the south London venue and others like it have enough money to keep going until the autumn. Arts Council England has made £90m of emergency funding available to keep organisations afloat until the end of September.After that, they will need a government bailout. Without one ""many of us will fall off a cliff"" in the subsequent months, Kwei-Armah explains.The key to reopening will be an end to social distancing. ""It's almost impossible economically to socially distance a theatre,"" he says.""In order to social distance at 2m, we would lose three quarters of our audience. And then we have to work out how you create safe space for the rest of the staff - backstage and in a rehearsal room.""And then we have to work out what the public appetite might be towards coming back into a theatre.""It will then take three months to get back up and running, taking staffing and rehearsals into account, he adds.The Young Vic is planning different reopening scenarios up to next April - more than a year after going dark.The venue has furloughed most staff but has continued some work - reaching 100 members of its young directors scheme online every day, and running a local playwriting programme. Staff are also making food deliveries for a local charity.When theatres do turn the lights back on, Kwei-Armah says those who have often been excluded in the past must be present.""From class to race to gender, we have made great progress over the last few years in our sector in trying to equalise it,"" he says.""I'm determined absolutely that all of that progress that we've made cannot go for naught. We have to rebuild with that as a fundamental.""The Young Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire will be streamed by the National Theatre from 21 May.Coronavirus hasn't stopped the youth and elders groups at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre making a show together - they have just done it online.The five episodes of Connect Fest, about an ageing band reforming for a festival, are being released daily this week.""We're still trying to do what we are here to do, which is to give people moments of connection through art,"" says joint artistic director Roy Alexander Weise.""It's hard, though, because the team who are producing that piece of work has been cut down because we've had to furlough close to 90% of our staff to help keep ourselves afloat financially, because we aren't making the money that we would do.""When the venue does eventually reopen, Weise and co-artistic director Bryony Shanahan are also thinking about socially-distanced shows.""It doesn't necessarily make financial sense for us to do that,"" he says. ""But we understand that our purpose is greater than financial gain. It is far greater - it's connection, wellbeing, equal opportunities.""So I guess, just like everyone else, we're clinging on for dear life trying to see what will happen next, and all we can do is prepare ourselves as best we can to brace for whatever the landscape looks like.""Producing shows is going to feel incredibly difficult to do in the coming months.""End of Youtube post  by rxtheatreHow will the pandemic change theatre? Weise says many people are afraid of ""a huge regression"" in the types of plays and voices heard, seeking refuge in ""plays that they know will sell"".He goes so far as to say some think ""it might be a good thing for some institutions to go"" - venues that ""for a very long time have been led by lots of people who all look the same, who invite the same audiences in.""He's focusing on his theatre's purpose and why it stages the shows it does. ""We've all got more than enough time now to think about our why as artistic leaders.""The current hiatus is a chance to prepare for allowing a wider range of people to tell their stories, he says. ""Narrative is everything. It really does rule the world.""We have a real opportunity to allow people to understand the power of story, allow people to step into some of that power, who maybe haven't been able to step into that power before, and see the exciting ways in which our world can progress.""When the Royal Court shut in March, it put the words ""Back Soon"" up in big letters on the front of its building in west London. But how soon?""We keep coming up with different scenarios for when we could open and how we could open, and we alight on one thing, and then that slips,"" artistic director Vicky Featherstone says.""The closest I can imagine being able to invite a full capacity audience is around January.""It's too risky to commit the money for a big production before that. ""If there was another spike [in infections], or actors get ill, we would have to stop again and that would be really damaging.""That doesn't necessarily mean the building will be totally shut until 2021. Featherstone is trying to think of ""creative, socially distanced ways"" to host events, perhaps for young people, in the autumn. ""Something more playful and hopeful, a bit more radical, reckless, for much, much smaller groups of people,"" she explains.As well as thinking about how to make members of the public feel safe, she is preoccupied by the predicaments of the freelancers who work on their shows. All plays that had been announced will go ahead - at some point.""We have a massive freelance and self-employed workforce that I think we have taken for granted. And now we need to think about how they are supported.""Most of the theatre's education and outreach work has continued digitally, and it has put David Ireland's play Cyprus Avenue online. The Royal Court website is now showing a live feed of the empty theatre.End of Youtube post  by royalcourttheatreTheatres play a crucial role, she says, citing research that (in normal times) more people go to theatres than to Premier League football matches. They are also where many people in film and TV learn their craft.Featherstone points to Alice Birch, who came through the Royal Court's ranks before co-writing BBC Three's hit drama Normal People.""We all need stories and we all need our imaginations to be fired up,"" Featherstone says. ""From Shakespeare onwards, we have absolutely led the world. We want to be able to continue that.""Pitlochry Festival Theatre in the Scottish Highlands has postponed its summer season, which had been due to start next week.But artistic director Elizabeth Newman has been busy organising activities, like a phone line for actors to have chats with lonely locals; three daily rays of ""Light Hope Joy"" on social media; and 50 works of art dedicated to the River Tay.One of the summer shows, David Greig's new play Adventures with the Painted People, is being made for BBC Radio 3 instead.""We've tried to remain a producing organisation that is making art,"" Newman says. ""On the one hand we're doing that and on the other, myself and Kris [Bryce], the executive director, are working around the clock to work out how we can survive this crisis.""That means working out how to stage socially-distanced shows. ""We need to be looking at how we can make work that adheres to government guidelines, but also we need to make sure that we're solvent,"" she says.If they tried to socially distance the 538-capacity auditorium, they would only be able to admit 70 people, which ""is not financially viable"". So Newman and Bryce are looking beyond the building to its 11-acre grounds.""We're going to have to conceive programmes of work that are not necessarily in the auditorium and are outside, and are quality and rich for our audience, but not necessarily about them being shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers.""Those are the ideas I'm coming up with - work outdoors, different kinds of performances, different kinds of events, different kinds of social happenings that can occur, but that don't place peoples' lives at risk.""The theatre is the biggest employer in the area, but there are likely to be redundancies. ""I feel that weight very heavily on my shoulders,"" Newman says.""Some tough decisions are going to have to be made. And it's not going to be small changes, it's going to be big changes for a time. And that feels incredibly painful if I'm honest.""Newman says Creative Scotland hasn't been in a position to offer extra financial support, so she is hoping for an extra package from the UK government.""It's going to be the last industry that's going to be able to get up to full function, and we're just praying that they're going to come back with some sort of relief and support.""Adventures with the Painted People is on Radio 3 on 7 June.In response to a question about theatres at Wednesday's Downing Street briefing, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""All of us who care about the arts are very concerned for the future of theatres, museums and galleries, performing arts, all of those who work in the sector.""The arts are ""incredibly important to the UK"" and ""one of our great international strengths"" as well as being ""important for our wellbeing"", he said.Many arts organisations have had government support through the furlough scheme, while self-employed people could access grants, he explained.""The culture secretary is also working very closely with our main cultural institutions to see how we can guide them through undoubtedly a very difficult time, and to put in place the social distancing guidelines so they are ready to reopen when the science and medical opinion allows,"" he continued.""We hope that that will be later this summer,"" he added, citing the plan for easing the lockdown, which was published earlier this week. ""But it is very conditional on continuing to keep the rate of infection down, and continuing to control the virus.""",14 May 2020,entertainment
Eurovision: Abba's Waterloo voted best song of all time,"Abba's Waterloo has been named the greatest Eurovision song of all time by BBC viewers.Eurovision: Come Together saw the public vote for their favourites, on the night that this year's song contest was due to take place.The 2020 competition was cancelled in March amid the coronavirus pandemic.The Swedish foursome won it in 1974 in Brighton. The track, which topped the UK charts and set them on their way to fame, went on to sell nearly 6m copies.Speaking later on the night, Bjorn Ulvaeus from the band said he found it ""hard to believe"" that was where it began for them all those years ago.The shortlist for the programme included Eurovision classics from the likes of Netta, Bucks Fizz, Conchita Wurst and Gina G.But it was Agnetha, Anni-Frid, Benny and Bjorn who ultimately triumphed, with their musical metaphor about the joys of surrendering to love.End of Youtube post  by AbbaVEVOThe 19-strong song list was compiled by Eurovision experts and broadcasters, including Rylan Clark-Neal, Scott Mills, Ken Bruce, Adele Roberts and Mel Giedroyc, as well as former UK acts SuRie and Nicki French.Presenter Graham Norton upheld the tradition of raising a glass to the late Sir Terry Wogan, who hosted the contest for nearly 30 years.""We couldn't deny you your Eurovision fix,"" he declared.The programme also showcased what would have been the UK entry this year - James Newman's My Last Breath - and Norton spoke to the singer via video link.Newman said he was ""pretty gutted"" and ""had to have a few minutes to myself"" when he found out the contest had been cancelled.He said the staging had already been planned and showed an image of an underwater scene leading down from some steps.Newman added that his favourite Eurovision entry this year was Iceland's - it was one of the favourites to win had the competition gone ahead, according to recent Spotify streaming figures.Later on on Saturday evening, the BBC also joined with other European broadcasters for Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light, to honour all 41 songs which would have competed this year. Some of this year's songs would have been eliminated at the semi-finals, where the entrants are normally whittled down to 26 but the semis were also cancelled.The event was hosted from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where the contest was due to take place, while Norton popped up again as the UK's commentator, and acts appeared in various forms from across the continent.1. Another Swedish act's tributeMåns Zelmerlöw sang an acoustic version of Heroes, his winning song from 2015, in homage to health workers during the coronavirus pandemic.End of Youtube post  by Eurovision Song Contest2. Fans answered Ireland's (video) callDouble Eurovision winner, Ireland's Johnny Logan, was joined by scores of fans via video-link for a rendition of his most relevantly-titled track, What's Another Year.3. Love shone its light, not once but twiceThe Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra joined forces (via the wonders of modern technology) to perform an instrumental version of the UK's 1997-winning Love Shine a Light, by Katrina and the Waves, as iconic music venues around the world lit up.This was certainly a high point for another former UK contestant SuRie, who said she had been left ""broken"" by the performance… in a good way.The track got another airing for the show's finale, but this time with the lyrics too, as performers from all countries sang along in unison.End of Youtube post 2 by Eurovision Song Contest4. There were FIVE Daði Freyr PéturssonsIceland's eccentric performer urged us all to ""stay healthy"" and ""stay fabulous"" with the help of a barbershop quartet, comprised of different digital versions of himself, all wearing the same sweater bearing an image of, yep, you guessed it... him again.TV critic Scott Bryan, for one, enjoyed it.5. A socially-distanced 'mass' gathering took placeMichael Schulte, Germany's entrant in 2018, and 2014 Dutch act The Common Linnets came together for a socially-distanced and fairly biblical looking grand church service-style rendition of Nicole's 1982 winning song Ein Bisschen Frieden.End of Youtube post 3 by Eurovision Song Contest6. Conchita went commandoThe Austrian singer and drag act Conchita Wurst, who won in 2014, confessed that the ""most beautiful"" part of the coronavirus lockdown was the fact, ""I hardly wear any underwear and I love it so much"".7. Graham Norton got delayedThe UK broadcaster admitted, ""there's no denying this is a very odd programme"" - referring to the lack of an actual competition this year, for the first time since the contest began in 1956.It got even odder as he had to take part in a live two-way chat with the Dutch hosts, with a bit of a delay. ""That was awkward,"" he joked, but he also said the show as a whole had ""real emotion"".8. Bjorn was 'happy' to forget about you know what for a wee while Abba were the winners who took it all in the earlier BBC poll, and there was a rare TV appearance from the aforementioned Bjorn in the Shine A Light show.After recounting a sweet tale about the time his grandson Albert first realised his grandad was a Eurovision pop star, he described the contest as one of the most ""genuinely joyous events of the TV year"" which ""allows you to escape and be happy and even forget about the coronavirus for a little while"".End of Youtube post 4 by Eurovision Song ContestThe show featured messages of love and support from all of the acts who would have featured in the competition. Some viewers though, it seems, would have preferred more action and less well-wishing.""I miss when Eurovision was fun,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""A chance to escape everything else. Yes the world is in a terrible place but the title is Shine a Light, not doom.""""They have badly judged what we all wanted,"" offered another. ""We wanted a party, even a Zoom party would have done, but this is a bit depressing.Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James, however, thought the show's producers hit all the right notes.""Don't know about anyone else but I'm pretty emotional watching this,"" she posted.None of the 2020 songs will be carried over to next year. Instead, countries will select new entrants for the 2021 contest. Several countries - including Greece, Spain and Bulgaria - have confirmed they will send the same acts next year to give the artists a second chance, but they will have to perform different songs.Currently, there's no word on whether the UK's 2020 entrant James Newman will be chosen for the 2021 contest, although he has said he ""absolutely"" wants to represent his country again.It was confirmed that Rotterdam, which missed out this year, would indeed be allowed to host the show in 2021 instead.",16 May 2020,entertainment
