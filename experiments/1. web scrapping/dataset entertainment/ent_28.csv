"Alicia Keys, LL Cool J and the new wave of protest songs","The death of George Floyd has prompted one of the biggest movements against racism since the civil rights era.Protests were held globally after video footage from Minneapolis showed a white police officer kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes. The 46-year-old could be heard repeatedly telling the officer, ""I can't breathe"".Around the world, music became a crucial way for people to express their grief and anger. Bob Marley's Get Up, Stand Up and Bill Withers' Lean On Me soundtracked several protests, while streaming figures for songs that call out police violence soared: from Childish Gambino's This Is America and Kendrick Lamar's Alright to NWA's visceral hip-hop track [Expletive] Tha Police.The latter was also used by hackers to disrupt police scanners in Chicago during the protests. In a more unifying moment, protestors in Atlanta encouraged the National Guard to join them in performing the Macarena.As the Black Lives Matter movement continues, the record industry has been paused to examine its own history of racial exclusion, and the inequity between black artists and the mainly white executives who profit from their work.Meanwhile, artists have channelled their frustration and anger into a new wave of protest songs, directly inspired by Mr Floyd's death and its aftermath.Here are some of the most striking examples - but please be aware that many of these songs contain explicit language.End of Youtube post  by Alicia Keys - TopicSung from the perspective of a mourning mother whose son has been shot to death, Alicia Keys' new single was released on Juneteenth - a holiday celebrating the emancipation of enslaved people in the US.It was originally written in response to the deaths of Mike Brown and Sandra Bland, the former killed by police in Missouri in 2014, the latter who died in a jail cell in 2015 after Texas police stopped her for a minor traffic violation - but Keys said the message was ""never not going to be relevant"".""Of course there is no perfect way to die,"" she wrote in an Instagram caption, as she premiered the song. ""This phrase doesn't even make sense but that's what makes the title so powerful and heartbreaking because so many have died unjustly. ""We all know none of these innocent lives should have been taken due to the culture of police violence.""End of Youtube post  by HERMusicVEVO""Just by the title, you know that it means something painful,"" said Grammy-nominated R&B artist H.E.R. as she debuted her new song in a living room concert.""These lyrics were kind of easy to write because it came from a conversation of what's happening right now, what's been happening, and the change that we need to see,"" she said before her performance. ""I think music is powerful when it comes to change and when it comes to healing, and that's why I wrote this song, to make a mark in history.""The sombre, guitar-led song asks: ""What is a gun to a man that surrenders / What's it gonna take for someone to defend her / If we all agree that we're equal as people / Then why can't we see what's evil?""H.E.R. said the track tackles the question that's been plaguing her over the last few weeks: Why is there so much hate?""My favourite line in the song is, 'How do we cope when we don't love each other?'"" she told TMZ. ""I think we're all questioning that now.""A post shared by LL COOL J (@llcoolj) on May 31, 2020 at 7:13pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by llcooljFrom the very first bar, you can tell LL Cool J won't be holding back.""For 400 years you had your knees on our necks,"" he raps. ""A garden of evil with no seeds of respect"".The 52-year-old goes on to ask what would have happened to former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, had he not been filmed by bystanders during Mr Floyd's fatal arrest.""Watching that man die slow left a hole,"" he says, ""If it wasn't for them phones, Chauvin would be at home / Feeling justified because of George skin tone / I'm telling those with melanin, you're not alone.""End of Youtube post  by Dua SalehMinneapolis artist Dua Saleh originally wrote Body Cast in response to the deaths of Jamar Clark and Philando Castile, who were fatally shot by police in separate incidents in 2015 and 2016.""Unfortunately, I could have written the song at any point in my life and it would have been relevant, which is frightening to say the least,"" they told the Switched On Pop podcast.The intro samples clips of Angela Whitehead, a woman from Montana who went viral last year when she rebuked two police officers for entering her home without a warrant or viable cause.Saleh later references the stand-off in her lyrics, singing: ""You must be crazy, coming up in here talking about you heard something /  You heard me talking, I talk loud and I'm aggressive and guess what? / You did not knock on my door.""""I just don't trust police officers in general,"" the singer said. ""I was just like disgusted at the thought that policing was a safe and viable option for black communities.""Proceeds from the song's download are being donated to the Minneapolis-based organisation, Black Visions Collective.End of Youtube post  by Denzel Curry""Someone asked, how do I feel?"" Terrace Martin wrote, as he introduced his response to George Floyd's death. ""I told them hurt, fearless, angry, aware and fully ready to protect me, my family and my people at all cost. I got together with black men that felt the same way and created a work of truth.""The result is Pig Feet - a frenetic and urgent collision of jazz and hip-hop, where Kamasi Washington's fidgety saxophone emphasises lyrics about structural racism and police brutality.It was first released on YouTube, accompanied by a video compiling clips from recent Black Lives Matter protests, followed by a list of victims of police violence that scroll silently up the screen. just singing what‚Äôs on my heart...hope this blesses someoneüôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è @sdhtoronto thanks for this dope shirt!!üî•üî• #ijustwantolive #blacklivesmatter #ijustwannalive #equality #black #blackexcellence #racism #justice @mstinalawsonA post shared by  Keedron Bryant (@keedronbryant) on May 26, 2020 at 2:01pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by keedronbryantTwelve-year-old Keedron Bryant gave voice to the feelings of thousands when he uploaded a simple, a capella performance of the original song I Just Wanna Live to Instagram three weeks ago.""I'm a young black man / Doing all that I can / To stand, oh but when I look around / And I see what's being done to my kind/ Every day, I'm being hunted as prey,"" he sang, looking directly into the camera.His performance, and the directness of the lyrics, written by his mother, won praise from Barack Obama, LeBron James, Janet Jackson and Katy Perry, who reposted the song to her followers with the message #BLACKLIVESMATTER.On Friday, record label Warner Bros announced it had signed Keedron to a recording contract.",19 June 2020,entertainment

He added: ""It's like eight Super Bowl half-time shows back to back.""End of Youtube post  by NetflixThe New York Times described the film - which is almost 150 minutes long - as consisting of footage ""viewers have already seen (and, perhaps, seen again and again) this time through a greater variety of angles and Instagram-like filters.

The 46-year-old could be heard repeatedly telling the officer, ""I can't breathe"".Around the world, music became a crucial way for people to express their grief and anger. Bob Marley's Get Up, Stand Up and Bill Withers' Lean On Me soundtracked several protests, while streaming figures for songs that call out police violence soared: from Childish Gambino's This Is America and Kendrick Lamar's Alright to NWA's visceral hip-hop track [Expletive] Tha Police.The latter was also used by hackers to disrupt police scanners in Chicago during the protests. In a more unifying moment, protestors in Atlanta encouraged the National Guard to join them in performing the Macarena.As the Black Lives Matter movement continues, the record industry has been paused to examine its own history of racial exclusion, and the inequity between black artists and the mainly white executives who profit from their work.Meanwhile, artists have channelled their frustration and anger into a new wave of protest songs, directly inspired by Mr Floyd's death and its aftermath.Here are some of the most striking examples - but please be aware that many of these songs contain explicit language.End of Youtube post  by Alicia Keys - TopicSung from the perspective of a mourning mother whose son has been shot to death, Alicia Keys' new single was released on Juneteenth - a holiday celebrating the emancipation of enslaved people in the US.It was originally written in response to the deaths of Mike Brown and Sandra Bland, the former killed by police in Missouri in 2014, the latter who died in a jail cell in 2015 after Texas police stopped her for a minor traffic violation - but Keys said the message was ""never not going to be relevant"".""Of course there is no perfect way to die,"" she wrote in an Instagram caption, as she premiered the song. ""This phrase doesn't even make sense but that's what makes the title so powerful and heartbreaking because so many have died unjustly. ""We all know none of these innocent lives should have been taken due to the culture of police violence.""End of Youtube post  by HERMusicVEVO""Just by the title, you know that it means something painful,"" said Grammy-nominated R&B artist H.E.R. as she debuted her new song in a living room concert.""These lyrics were kind of easy to write because it came from a conversation of what's happening right now, what's been happening, and the change that we need to see,"" she said before her performance. ""I think music is powerful when it comes to change and when it comes to healing, and that's why I wrote this song, to make a mark in history.""The sombre, guitar-led song asks: ""What is a gun to a man that surrenders / What's it gonna take for someone to defend her / If we all agree that we're equal as people / Then why can't we see what's evil?""H.E.R. said the track tackles the question that's been plaguing her over the last few weeks: Why is there so much hate?""My favourite line in the song is, 'How do we cope when we don't love each other?'"" she told TMZ. ""I think we're all questioning that now.""A post shared by LL COOL J (@llcoolj) on May 31, 2020 at 7:13pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by llcooljFrom the very first bar, you can tell LL Cool J won't be holding back.""For 400 years you had your knees on our necks,"" he raps. ""A garden of evil with no seeds of respect"".The 52-year-old goes on to ask what would have happened to former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, had he not been filmed by bystanders during Mr Floyd's fatal arrest.""Watching that man die slow left a hole,"" he says, ""If it wasn't for them phones, Chauvin would be at home / Feeling justified because of George skin tone / I'm telling those with melanin, you're not alone.""End of Youtube post  by Dua SalehMinneapolis artist Dua Saleh originally wrote Body Cast in response to the deaths of Jamar Clark and Philando Castile, who were fatally shot by police in separate incidents in 2015 and 2016.""Unfortunately, I could have written the song at any point in my life and it would have been relevant, which is frightening to say the least,"" they told the Switched On Pop podcast.The intro samples clips of Angela Whitehead, a woman from Montana who went viral last year when she rebuked two police officers for entering her home without a warrant or viable cause.Saleh later references the stand-off in her lyrics, singing: ""You must be crazy, coming up in here talking about you heard something /  You heard me talking, I talk loud and I'm aggressive and guess what? / You did not knock on my door.""""I just don't trust police officers in general,"" the singer said. ""I was just like disgusted at the thought that policing was a safe and viable option for black communities.""Proceeds from the song's download are being donated to the Minneapolis-based organisation, Black Visions Collective.End of Youtube post  by Denzel Curry""Someone asked, how do I feel?"" Terrace Martin wrote, as he introduced his response to George Floyd's death. ""I told them hurt, fearless, angry, aware and fully ready to protect me, my family and my people at all cost.

Beyonce drops live album with Netflix film,"Beyonc√©'s Netflix documentary, Homecoming, has arrived with a surprise: A new Beyonc√© album.The star, who perfected the art of stealth releases with a self-titled album in 2013, announced the new record just hours before Homecoming premiered.Both the film and the album capture her 2018 Coachella set - which celebrated black power and liberation.They include live versions of Crazy In Love and Drunk In Love, as well as her reunion with Destiny's Child.Fans also get one new studio recording - a cover of Maze's 1981 hit Before I Let Go, which plays over the closing credits of the film.A post shared by BeyonceÃÅ (@beyonce) on Apr 17, 2019 at 12:30am PDTEnd of Instagram post  by beyonceBeyonc√©'s Coachella performance - which took place over two weekends last April - marked the first time a black woman had headlined the festival.The star pulled out all the stops, employing dozens of dancers and an elaborate marching band, acknowledging the importance of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) - institutions established in the US before the 1964 Civil Rights Act to serve the black community that was shut out by predominantly white establishments.Lavished with praise at the time, the release of the Netflix documentary has seen a second wave of acclaim.""For some of us who were actually there at Coachella, there might've been a slight fear that we were overselling the show,"" said Variety Magazine's Chris Willman.""Rewatching it on film a year later, 'high water mark in 21st century entertainment' actually almost feels like it's underselling it.""BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson noted that there was ""very little documentary content, but as a concert film it's up there with Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense and Prince's Sign 'O' The Times"". He added: ""It's like eight Super Bowl half-time shows back to back.""End of Youtube post  by NetflixThe New York Times described the film - which is almost 150 minutes long - as consisting of footage ""viewers have already seen (and, perhaps, seen again and again) this time through a greater variety of angles and Instagram-like filters. ""The 'intimate and 'candid' moments touted by Netflix are brief in comparison,"" they add, ""appearing between long, uninterrupted musical segments from the show.""Those moments will be enough to satisfy the overzealous Beyhive and probably more casual fans and admirers, too.""""While the behind-the-scenes footage is only a fraction of the total film, Beyonc√© is refreshingly candid about the hard work that it took to put the shows together,"" wrote Brittany Spanos in Rolling Stone.""Some of the film's best scenes include the pop diva sternly but kindly dragging her team, who seem to have a hard time grasping her highly specific vision.""Fans were similarly enthusiastic, with A Wrinkle In Time director Ava DuVernay writing on Twitter: ""Gah! This has been my favourite thing for a whole year now.""I can watch it on repeat and never, ever get tired. So much to see. So many moves to try in one's mirror. If one were so inclined.""Others were left in awe of the vocal talents of Beyonce and Jay-Z's seven-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy Carter - who emulates her mother's performance of the ""black national anthem"" Lift Every Voice and Sing.Sarah V tweeted: ""Listening to Blue Ivy signing on Beyonc√© Homecoming album she is clearly a young star in the making!""",17 April 2019,entertainment

The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal.""I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,"" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media.The music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she ""comes across aggressive"".She said she was told: ""You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that"", and added: ""I am so upset with myself that I allowed that.""

""I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. ""I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience.

"Alicia Keys, LL Cool J and the new wave of protest songs","The death of George Floyd has prompted one of the biggest movements against racism since the civil rights era.Protests were held globally after video footage from Minneapolis showed a white police officer kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes. The 46-year-old could be heard repeatedly telling the officer, ""I can't breathe"".Around the world, music became a crucial way for people to express their grief and anger. Bob Marley's Get Up, Stand Up and Bill Withers' Lean On Me soundtracked several protests, while streaming figures for songs that call out police violence soared: from Childish Gambino's This Is America and Kendrick Lamar's Alright to NWA's visceral hip-hop track [Expletive] Tha Police.The latter was also used by hackers to disrupt police scanners in Chicago during the protests. In a more unifying moment, protestors in Atlanta encouraged the National Guard to join them in performing the Macarena.As the Black Lives Matter movement continues, the record industry has been paused to examine its own history of racial exclusion, and the inequity between black artists and the mainly white executives who profit from their work.Meanwhile, artists have channelled their frustration and anger into a new wave of protest songs, directly inspired by Mr Floyd's death and its aftermath.Here are some of the most striking examples - but please be aware that many of these songs contain explicit language.End of Youtube post  by Alicia Keys - TopicSung from the perspective of a mourning mother whose son has been shot to death, Alicia Keys' new single was released on Juneteenth - a holiday celebrating the emancipation of enslaved people in the US.It was originally written in response to the deaths of Mike Brown and Sandra Bland, the former killed by police in Missouri in 2014, the latter who died in a jail cell in 2015 after Texas police stopped her for a minor traffic violation - but Keys said the message was ""never not going to be relevant"".""Of course there is no perfect way to die,"" she wrote in an Instagram caption, as she premiered the song. ""This phrase doesn't even make sense but that's what makes the title so powerful and heartbreaking because so many have died unjustly.

X Factor's Alexandra Burke reveals music industry racism,"Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin ""to look whiter"".After winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would ""have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin"".In a 15-minute Instagram video, she recalls being told: ""You can't have braids, you can't have an afro.""You have to have hair... that appeals to white people.""The 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as ""heartbreaking"".Burke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestant Misha B, who recently spoke out about ""being devalued"" at the hands of the music industry.Misha B claimed the X Factor projected ""this angry black girl narrative"", using words such as ""feisty"" and ""bully"" to describe her after one a live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal.""I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,"" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media.The music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she ""comes across aggressive"".She said she was told: ""You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that"", and added: ""I am so upset with myself that I allowed that."" Burke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard.The singer said was told: ""Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner"".""It's hurtful,"" she added.She was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing.She recalled how one journalist accused her of ""being a diva"" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died.""That was the image they had of me, because of the papers."" she said. ""I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. ""I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. ""I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone.""She said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because ""the truth is all we've got"".""I just feel like people need to not see colour,"" said Burke. ""My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. ""People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings.

Sir Ian Holm: Lord of the Rings and Alien star dies aged 88,"Stage and film actor Sir Ian Holm, who played Bilbo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings films, has died aged 88.Sir Ian, Oscar-nominated as Olympic running coach Sam Mussabini in Chariots of Fire, also played the android Ash in 1979's Alien.""It is with great sadness we can confirm that the actor Sir Ian Holm CBE passed away this morning at the age of 88,"" his agent said in a statement.""He died peacefully in hospital with his family and carer,"" he added.His illness was Parkinson's-related, his agent confirmed.Holm, who also played Dr Willis in The Madness of King George, was classically trained and put in memorable performances in numerous plays.The National Theatre remembered him as an ""extraordinary actor"" whose performance as King Lear in 1997 created ""wonderful memories"".Samuel West, whose father Timothy played Gloucester in the production, recalled on Twitter that the older cast members were all asked to grow beards.When they came together for a read-through, he remembered, ""[director] Richard Eyre said it looked like a garden gnome convention"".Sir Ian originated the role of Lenny in Harold Pinter's The Homecoming in 1965, reprising his performance on film eight years later. However, his stage career was cut short after he developed acute stage fright during a production of The Iceman Cometh in 1976.He went on to work primarily in film, thanks to roles in such high-profile movies as The Fifth Element and the Lord of the Rings series.It was 1981's Chariots of Fire that saw him receive his best supporting actor Oscar nomination.The same film won him a Bafta, as did his supporting performance in The Bofors Gun in 1968.Sir Ian played Bilbo in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, having played Frodo Baggins for BBC radio in 1981.Diminutive in stature, he was similarly well-cast as Pod in 1992 children's series The Borrowers.""I'm never the same twice,"" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000, ""and I'm not a movie star-type, so people don't demand that I'm always the same.""He received a knighthood in 1998 for his contribution to drama following the CBE he received in 1989.Comedian Eddie Izzard remembered Sir Ian as ""a wonderful actor"", adding: ""It's so sad to see him go.""Director Edgar Wright also paid tribute, calling him ""a genius actor who brought considerable presence to parts funny, heartbreaking and terrifying"".""What an actor,"" tweeted League of Gentleman star Reece Shearsmith. ""A lifetime of incredible performances.""Peep Show star Robert Webb was among many others to express respect for ""a splendid actor"" who ""could be very funny too"".",19 June 2020,entertainment

"Move over Tony, the Antonyo Awards are here to celebrate black theatre talent","Covid-19 means the 2020 Tony Awards - New York's annual celebration of Broadway theatre - are on hold. But the first Antonyo Awards are happening later.The idea is to recognise the best of African American theatrical talent, which the organisers say doesn't always get its due.Darius Barnes is a Broadway dancer and choreographer who until March was in the Tina Fey musical Mean Girls. He's already working on the new Michael Jackson show MJ, now scheduled to hit Broadway next year.He could have found time hanging heavy after the coronavirus pandemic closed all New York theatres on 12 March. Instead, he's one of a group of ambitious African American theatre practitioners pulling together the inaugural Antonyo Awards.He says the awards, whose name is a riff on the long-established Tonys, are a celebration of black theatre talent and blackness in general. ""We wanted to do something to uplift the black theatre community and the contribution it's made to Broadway and off-Broadway theatre,"" he says.Barnes says it's just chance that the Antonyos are launching in the year of Covid-19. ""But I think actually they might have been harder to get started in normal times - everyone in New York theatre is always crazy busy.""But now everyone's at home working through Zoom or whatever and they had a little more time to donate their talent and record material for this week's show. I don't know if a live red carpet event would ever have happened this quickly.""The ceremony is online on Friday, 19 June - or ""Juneteenth"", the anniversary of the end of slavery in 1865. Presenters will include Audra McDonald, one of Broadway's most acclaimed stars, and Titus Burgess of the Netflix series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Around 8,000 people voted online for theatre talent shortlisted in almost 30 categories. Some are the performance categories you would expect, such as best actor in a play. But executive producer Drew Shade says it's equally important to look at black talent in less glamorous areas such as best lighting design and best sound.""There's a huge gap in the representation of people of colour in categories like scenic design, both on Broadway and off Broadway,"" he says. ""That's definitely one of the things we are highlighting.""(The term off-Broadway usually refers to Manhattan theatres that hold between 100 and 499 people.)Shade also runs the website BroadwayBlack.com. He says around 50 shows in the last Broadway season (until terminated by Covid-19) featured African American talent, on stage or off. ""Given how many shows there can be in New York, that's not a massive number. So where are all the black orchestrators for instance? That's a major job in Broadway theatre.""So are the Antonyo Awards intended to be a criticism of the the Tonys, which have existed since 1947 and are broadcast live on network television each year?Since 2000, there have been just four black winners of the Tony for best actress in a play. Denzel Washington is the only black actor to have taken the equivalent male award in the same period.""I don't call it criticism,"" says Shade. ""It's more that we're shining a light on what the situation is. Instead of trying to shame people, we thought, let's just do something ourselves now. ""We know certain things about society and how people want to be treated. We know what feels right and what's morally right.""The Antonyos are of course also happening as the Black Lives Matter movement is news around the world. ""Black Lives Matter has been a part of our culture for several years since Trayvon Martin's death [in 2012] - the culture of our bodies not being valued,"" Shade says.""I don't want to ride on the back of a movement which is so much more than what I am doing.""But we are doing the work to make sure we are uplifting each other. I am happy that the awards are starting when people actually need this joy right now.""The Antonyo Awards can be watched on YouTube at 19:00 EST (midnight BST) on Friday.",19 June 2020,entertainment
Six movies resuming production after coronavirus,"While lockdown may have provided us with the chance to catch up on some old movies, there's only so many you can watch before you crave something new.Agreed? Agreed.Well, fear not, because around the world some of the big-hitters are starting to re-commence production - which was of course halted by Covid-19 - in a variety of socially-distanced ways.Here are just six of the films to keep your fingers crossed for then in 2021, when the cinemas are hopefully back in business.The long-awaited sequel to James Cameron's 2009 sci-fi blockbuster was able to re-start filming in New Zealand this week, because the country is almost coronavirus free.Cameron and producer Jon Landau told the press Down Under that part two of the planned five-part film series; rumoured to be called The Way of Water (oh yeah, it's set under water this time, by the way) would bring hundreds of jobs and millions of dollars back into the country following the pandemic.Laundau shared a photo on Instagram earlier this week as the production got under way. Used my iPhone to snap a picture of our first shot back in production on the Avatar sequels.A post shared by  Jon Landau (@jonplandau) on Jun 15, 2020 at 5:04pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by jonplandauIt will also bring some more big names including Kate Winslet and Vin Diesel to add to returning original stars Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Sam Worthington.Avatar 2, which is intended to work as a standalone feature (you won't need to have seen the first one, in other words), will focus on the children of Sully and Neytiri, who are by now leaders of their clan.The film is now slated for a December 2021 release, with film five in the diary already for 2027 - for those of you who like to plan ahead.If you thought reaching five films was impressive, the sixth film in the dinosaur movie franchise will be the first big production to resume in the UK next month, following rigorous new safety protocols on-set.(It's always best to stay at least two metres away from a dinosaur, or so we've read.)""Cost isn't our main concern now: it's safety,"" Universal bosses recently told Deadline., about its reported $5m (¬£4m) safety plan, which includes on-site doctors and 150 hand sanitiser stations being added to Pinewood Studios in London.Stars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are reportedly due to arrive back in London any day now, where they will have to self-isolate for two-weeks.Which should give them the opportunity to revise the original Jurassic Park film, before Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum all join them to reprise their roles as giant lizard-chasing academics for a final time.All being well, the results should be with us in June 2021.Back Down Under, but this time in Australia, director Baz Luhrmann's Elvis Presley biopic is expected to restart soon too.Filming came to a halt after star Tom Hanks, and his wife, the actor Rita Wilson, tested positive for Covid-19, but both later recovered.The currently-untitled movie will see Hanks portray Presley's long-standing and famously tough manager, Colonel Tom Parker. Austin Butler will play the young king of rock 'n' roll.Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk confirmed in a press conference on Wednesday that filming on the country's Gold Coast would commence: ""as soon as possible while making sure that the cast and crew can operate safely"".This film was always on our minds throughout lockdown and will hopefully be on our big screens by November 2021.The latest in a long line of delays and difficulties for the Tom Cruise-starring spy action thriller occurred in late February in Italy, which was decimated by the virus early on.Filming was then moved back to the UK before being halted altogether. However, first assistant director Tommy Gormley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this month that they hoped to go again from September and to still ""visit all the countries we planned to"".Actor Simon Pegg, who plays Benji Dunn in the franchise, told Variety it will ""begin with the outdoor stuff"", which he said ""feels fairly doable"".The producers' mission now, which they appear to have accepted, is to get the film in the cinemas for November 2021.Disney's live-action remake of the classic animation, starring Halle Bailey and Melissa McCarthy, had to cancel its London filming plans just a week before it was due to start in March.Bailey, who went home to isolate in Los Angeles, has said she's ""very excited"" about the prospect of filming again.She told Entertainment Tonight: ""I was in London at the beginning of the year about to start filming and of course this pandemic caused everyone to slow down.""I actually welcomed it because I was really missing my sister who was here in LA, so I was happy to get back to her and I'm just so very excited for when we start back again.""It's just really coming together. I just feel honoured every day to even think about it or talk about, I'm like, 'What the heck? That's really happening?'""The film never did have a confirmed release date, even before the pandemic, although Digital Spy pointed out that an unnamed Disney live-action movie is pencilled in for release on November 19, 2021.Finally, from fish to winged creatures... Filming for the new Batman movie initially began in Glasgow in February with the caped crusader seen riding a motorbike in the city. However, it is thought the man seen in a Batman costume was a stuntman, rather than the film's star Robert Pattinson.Pattinson replaced Ben Affleck, after he hung up his cape, and the lengthy filming delay gave him chance to work on his fitness regime for the role.It's probably not dissimilar to your own lockdown workout. As the the US actor told Healthy For Men magazine, it involved cutting back on alcohol, and running ""5-10km, three to four times per week"" as well as ""bicycle crunches, dumbbell side bends, double crunches, and more"".He'll star opposite Zoe Kravitz, who'll play the hero's complex love interest Catwoman.The film is due out in October 2021, when we'll hopefully get to discover how that inter-species relationship blossoms.",18 June 2020,entertainment
Christian Li: The young Harry Potter fan on his music stardom,"Like many 12-year-old schoolboys, Christian Li likes Harry Potter, The Hobbit and Angry Birds. But what sets him apart is his gift for the violin. ""I feel most happy and confident when I'm playing the violin,"" he says. ""I can express my feelings.""And it has made him a classical music superstar.Born in Melbourne to Chinese parents, Christian first picked up a violin at the age of five.  It was by no means inevitable. ""My parents don't play musical instruments. They are not musical,"" he says.  ""My mum is an accountant and my dad is an engineer.""But within weeks he had been chosen to play the violin in a television advert in China for powdered milk. And by the age of 10, Christian had made history, becoming the youngest-ever winner of the Menuhin competition, the world's leading violin competition. End of Youtube post  by Vivienne Gail Bruce""I was actually quite surprised, I didn't expect to win such a prestigious competition,"" he says modestly.  ""I didn't think about winning, I just thought about playing."" The video of his performance, on a half-size violin, of Summer from Vivaldi's Four Seasons  has since attracted millions of views online.The self-possessed youngster does admit:  ""I get a little bit nervous just before I get onto stage but after I start playing I'm fine.""And he is helped by a ritual which makes him ""feel a bit calmer ... and gives me energy.""He reveals: ""I always eat a banana"" before curtain up.Now, at the age of 12, in another musical first, Christian has become the youngest artist signed by the Decca Classics record label. For his first single he recorded the fiendishly difficult and technically demanding La Ronde Des Lutins or Dance of the Goblins, by the Italian composer and violinist Antonio Bazzini. Christian says he had wanted to learn the piece since he first heard it a couple of years ago. ""I was really captivated. It was Maxim Vengerov, (one of the most celebrated contemporary violinists and Christian's hero), and I think I watched the whole piece without even actually blinking.""When it came to record it, Christian had to play it only twice."" I got it right the second time."" He gives himself nine out of 10 for his performance. ""I'm satisfied with it but there's always room for improvement,"" he insists.  And that is why Christian Li practises for four hours every day after school - and more at weekends. ""I just get used to it and I enjoy it and I feel a bit relieved after I've practised.""If it sounds like all work and no play, he is keen to stress he does have spare time. He likes reading fiction, enjoying the ""magical world"" of Harry Potter and says he hope to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter when he next comes to the UK. ""I like swimming, cycling and running"" he says and plays computer games ""a  little, but not a lot""  like Angry Birds, rather than ones which involve ""fighting and bloody games."" Although he makes an exception for ""the classics like Michael Jackson,"" he says ""I do not really like listening to pop music very much."" Instead he prefers listening to movie soundtracks ""like Batman, Superman and Star Wars"".""They are very dramatic and they have lots of power in that music and they're classical as well.""There is no doubt his workload is demanding. He has performed at festivals and venues all over the world including the Sydney Opera House and Carnegie Hall in New York. Christian dreams of being ""a professional concert violin soloist.  I love to be travelling and playing exciting music with orchestras ... that's what I like to do.""But his burgeoning career has been interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.  He had, for example, been due to perform with the British cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason at the Australian Festival of Chamber Music in August.  ""All of my overseas trips and concert performances were now actually cancelled which is a little sad of course,"" he says. But Christian Li doesn't seem like a boy who is downcast for long.

X Factor's Alexandra Burke reveals music industry racism,"Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin ""to look whiter"".After winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would ""have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin"".In a 15-minute Instagram video, she recalls being told: ""You can't have braids, you can't have an afro.""You have to have hair... that appeals to white people.""The 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as ""heartbreaking"".Burke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestant Misha B, who recently spoke out about ""being devalued"" at the hands of the music industry.Misha B claimed the X Factor projected ""this angry black girl narrative"", using words such as ""feisty"" and ""bully"" to describe her after one a live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal.""I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,"" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media.The music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she ""comes across aggressive"".She said she was told: ""You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that"", and added: ""I am so upset with myself that I allowed that."" Burke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard.The singer said was told: ""Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner"".""It's hurtful,"" she added.She was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing.She recalled how one journalist accused her of ""being a diva"" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died.""That was the image they had of me, because of the papers."" she said. ""I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. ""I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. ""I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone.""She said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because ""the truth is all we've got"".""I just feel like people need to not see colour,"" said Burke. ""My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. ""People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings. So be kind.""",20 June 2020,entertainment
