Tony Slattery 'moved' by reaction to documentary,"Comedian Tony Slattery has said he's been ""genuinely moved"" by the reaction to the documentary about his battles with depression and drug addiction.What's the Matter with Tony Slattery?, on BBC Two's Horizon on Thursday, was broadcast following a revealing article in The Guardian in 2019.The programme followed the Whose Line Is It Anyway? star as he attempted to connect the dots between his undiagnosed bipolar tendencies, drug and alcohol use, and the abuse he suffered as a child by a priest.""I'm genuinely moved by all your messages of love, kindness, & support,"" he wrote on Twitter on Friday, paying special homage to his long-time partner Mark - ""the love of my life"".Slattery was an improvisational stand-up comedy TV star of the 80s and 90s, but withdrew from the public eye afterwards, due to deep-rooted and wide-ranging personal issues.The documentary saw him return to the stage in front of a live audience for the first time in decades.Viewers from around the worlds of medicine, comedy and beyond have praised him for finally telling his story.Stephen Fry, who appears in the feature to discuss his own experiences of mental health issues, described Slattery - a fellow ex-member the Cambridge University Footlights comedy set - as being ""painfully honest and as always utterly lovable"".""No-one in their right mind chooses to be depressed,"" Slattery tells his old friend Fry in the programme.Another comedian and broadcaster, Robin Ince, said it was ""sad to watch"" but ""a documentary that is definitely worth your time"".Ahead of the showing going out, Slattery told the Today programme's Nick Robinson it was ""a privilege"" to speak to experts about such issues, which he says are ""widespread, regardless of class or upbringing or money"".""There was denial,"" he added. ""Because I thought, 'look, some things happened a quarter of a century ago, I'm 60 now, [it was] when I was eight, what is the point?'""Slattery admitted on-screen that he worried the show was too ""self-regarding"", but just hoped it might at least help others in similar situations.The Times gave the feature five stars, with Carol Midgley, writing it was about ""how a comedian's tragedy was redeemed by love"".Lucy Mangan in The Guardian awarded four stars, calling it ""a moving study of drink, depression and abuse"".""Horizon's respectful and sensitive look at the comedian's life and struggles with addiction is a beacon of the genre,"" she wrote.""It was tough to watch the brightest of stars so dimmed,"" added Anita Singh in The Telegraph, also opting for four stars, while adding it was ""a brave film to make"".Sources: NHS, Royal College of Psychiatrists and Mind",22 May 2020,entertainment
Lana Del Rey responds to accusations of racism,"Lana Del Rey has defended herself against accusations of racism, arising from a statement she made about double standards in the music industry.In a long Instagram post this week the singer claimed she had been depicted as anti-feminist, despite singing about similar themes as other female artists.But some fans remarked the examples she chose - among them Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé - were mainly black women.Responding on Instagram, Del Rey said: ""Don't ever ever ever call me racist.""She went on: ""The singers I mentioned are my favourite singers so if you want to try and make a bone to pick out of that, like you always do be my guest.""It doesn't change the fact that I haven't had the same opportunity to express what I wanted to express without being completely decimated.""If you want to say that that has something to do with race that's your opinion but that's not what I was saying.""In her original post, Del Rey claimed she had been branded an anti-feminist pariah while ""Doja Cat, Ariana, Camila, Cardi B, Kehlani and Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé"" had all sung about ""being sexy, wearing no clothes... cheating, etc"" without facing similar criticism.Many people suggested the comments were tone deaf, with many wondering why the star had mostly cited women of colour.""Think Lana's post would have been fine if she hadn't compared herself to a group of mostly black women with the clear tone that she thinks she's been treated worse by the media when that's observably untrue,"" wrote Shon Faye on Twitter.""Lana blatantly ignoring the criticism Beyoncé, Nicki, and other black women have received (and continue to) for being confident in their sexuality doesn't sit right with me,"" added another user, simply calling themselves C.""Commercial success hasn't made them exempt from misogynistic attacks masked as constructive criticism.""""Even if she made a point, the inclusion of other women was so unnecessary and the fact the women were mostly black has left a bad taste,"" added journalist Toni Tone. ""The lines and adjectives also read like she's implying those women aren't as graceful, delicate or feminine as her. It's a messy statement.""The Guardian's Laura Snapes also responded with a column in which she said Del Rey's ""swipes at her peers of colour undermine her feminist argument"".Yet Del Rey was unrepentant and suggested her comments were being wilfully misinterpreted.""This is sad to make it about a WOC [women of colour] issue when I'm talking about my favourite singers,"" she wrote.""I could've literally said anyone but I picked my favourite people. And this is the problem with society today, not everything is about whatever you want it to be. ""It's exactly the point of my post - there are certain women that culture doesn't want to have a voice. ""It may not have to do with race. I don't know what it has to do with. I don't care anymore but don't ever, ever, ever, ever bro - call me racist because that is bull.""",22 May 2020,entertainment

Rapper Raxstar held a framed photo of his cousin and uncle, both of whom died after contracting coronavirus.""Losing them has been a big blow to our whole family,"" he told the BBC.""I want to keep their memories and spirits alive in everything I do going forward.""While most of the artists said they'd continued making new music during the lockdown, others have been inspired to pursue new ideas.Soul singer Ray BLK  has discovered a hidden talent for nail art.""As I haven't been able to go to the nail shop to get my nails done, I have people making custom nails, and I thought: 'This is so amazing being able to have all these great designs, and being able to do them myself at home.' ""It's been quite cool discovering new things.""Dance act Georgia, meanwhile, dragged a vintage kit of 1980s synth-drums onto her front porch, after setting up a virtual drumming circle to help her pass the time.""We started a project called Grooves in Different Rooms, which hopefully I'm going to livestream on my Instagram soon,"" she said.""It's going to be 20 different drummers positioned around the UK, some even in Europe, and we will livestream a jam.""BBC Sound of 2020 artist Joy Crookes also spoke of the importance of maintaining good mental health during quarantine.""My cat has massively helped my mental health during this time,"" said the star, whose latest single Anyone But Me addresses her life-long struggle with anxiety and self-doubt.

Ruby Rose leaves Batwoman - and other stars who exited major roles,"The Australian actress Ruby Rose is to leave her role as comic book superhero Batwoman after just one series.Rose said it had been a ""very difficult decision"" not to return to the show, which is shown in the UK on E4.Batwoman, which began on the CW network last year, is the first superhero show to have an openly gay lead character.Its producers said they were ""firmly committed"" to the show's ""long-term"" future and would re-cast the role with another member of the LGBTQ community.Rose, who is herself gay, said she was ""truly grateful... to everyone who made season one a success"". The 34-year-old said she had ""the utmost respect"" for everyone involved and that the decision to leave had not been ""made lightly"".Rose faced a backlash on social media when she was cast as Batwoman, with some saying the role should have gone to a lesbian actress.The actress, who has called herself ""gender-fluid"" in interviews, later deleted her Twitter profile, though she remains active on Instagram.Last year Rose revealed she had suffered an injury while filming the series that had required her to undergo emergency surgery.The actress said she had ""herniated two discs doing stunts"" - but Deadline reported the injury was not the reason for her departure.Born in Melbourne in 1986, Rose played Stella Carlin in Orange is the New Black and has appeared in such films as Pitch Perfect 3 and The Meg.Yet she is far from the first actor to leave or be replaced in a major film or TV show.George Lazenby famously walked away from the role of James Bond after making just one appearance in the popular spy film series.The model turned actor later admitted he had been persuaded by his then-manager - the late Ronan O'Rahilly - to seek other opportunities.""I thought he knew what he was talking about so I listened to him,"" the Australian told an audience at the National Film Theatre last year.Lazenby's single outing as Bond, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was released in 1969 and is now a firm fan favourite.Christopher Eccleston was cast as The Doctor when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 - but he departed after a single series.The actor, who was replaced by David Tennant, later said he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture"" of the show.""My relationship with my three immediate superiors... broke down irreparably during the first block of filming and it never recovered,"" he elaborated in 2018.The actor, currently to be seen in The A Word on BBC One, also said he had been ""out of his comfort zone"" playing the sci-fi drama's time-travelling hero.Edward Norton was cast as Bruce Banner in 2008's The Incredible Hulk but did not reprise the role in Marvel Studios' subsequent comic-book blockbusters.Its president Kevin Feige later said the role had been recast out of a ""need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members"".Speaking last year, Norton called Feige's 2010 statement ""cheap"" and that his exit had been the result of differing views on how to depict the character.""Ultimately they weren't going for long, dark and serious,"" said Norton, who was replaced by Mark Ruffalo when The Hulk returned in 2012's Avengers Assemble.Terrence Howard, who played James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in 2008's Iron Man, is another actor to be replaced in Marvel's superhero film series.He later claimed he was offered less money than he had been promised to reprise the role, which Don Cheadle has played since 2010's Iron Man 2.Sharon Gless played Christine Cagney in Cagney and Lacey for seven years, winning two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for her pains.Yet she was not the first actress to play the part in the popular US TV series about two female police detectives solving crimes in New York City.Loretta Swit played Cagney in the original TV movie but was not able to continue in the role when the CBS show went to series.Meg Foster was then cast, only to be replaced after six episodes because CBS allegedly wanted someone ""more feminine"" in the role.Speaking in 2012, Gless praised her co-star Tyne Daly for ""welcoming me as if she had not had anybody before me"".""I know her heart was hurting because she loved her last Cagney,"" she revealed.When Men Behaving Badly first began in 1992, the two flatmates were played by Martin Clunes and Harry Enfield.According to Clunes, though, the show that ITV produced did not match Enfield's hopes for it.""His original vision was for it not to be like a usual sitcom,"" Clunes told The Guardian in 2013. ""Then we made the pilot and it shocked him.""You could see Harry wanted out,"" he continued. ""He was under contract, though, so had to do one series.""Neil Morrissey was subsequently cast as Clunes' flatmate in the show, which continued on ITV for another series before being picked up by the BBC.Jodie Foster earned her second best actress Oscar for playing Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs - one of five Academy Awards Jonathan Demme's film won in 1992.When the offer came to reprise her role in Hannibal, though, she turned it down - opening the door for Julianne Moore to appear with Anthony Hopkins in Ridley Scott's 2001 follow-up.""I stand to make more money doing that sequel than I've ever made in my life,"" Foster was quoted as saying in 1999. ""But who cares, if it betrays Clarice?""""The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie,"" she elaborated in 2005. ""So I get to say, in a nice, dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot.""Amusingly, however, Foster was enticed to reprise her FBI agent character in 2017 for a satirical sketch on Stephen Colbert's late-night US talk show.End of Youtube post  by The Late Show with Stephen ColbertYou may also like:",20 May 2020,entertainment
Why Joe Rogan's exclusive Spotify deal matters,"Joe Rogan has signed an exclusive deal with Spotify, which will see his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, disappear from all other platforms.The multi-year deal is believed to be worth $100m (£82 million), according to the Wall Street Journal.Rogan's podcast, which is one of the most popular in the world, will arrive on the streaming giant on 1 September.It will then be housed there exclusively by the end of the year, and removed from all other platforms.""It will remain free, and it will be the exact same show,"" said Rogan. ""It's just a licensing deal, so Spotify won't have any creative control over the show.""They want me to just continue doing it the way I'm doing it right now.""I'm excited to have the support of the largest audio platform in the world and I hope you folks are there when we make the switch!""Joe Rogan is a US stand-up comedian and TV host-turned-provocateur, who launched his podcast in 2009 - in the early days of the medium.He invites a wide range of guests, including actors, musicians, comedians, politicians and conspiracy theorists on to the show, which has garnered a huge audience. Last year the podcast was downloaded 190 million times per month.Rogan has previously advocated for ""long-form media"" - and his own podcast episodes regularly run to two or three hours.The controversial entertainer also has 8.42 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, which has up until now shown the interviews in video form (this will stop when the new Spotify deal kicks in).But he has also attracted criticism - Rogan has been accused of making sexist, racist and transphobic comments in his podcasts.""The Joe Rogan Experience has become one of the internet's foremost vectors for anti-wokeness,"" wrote Justin Peters in Slate.In 2018, Rogan's show hit the headlines when the host shared a cannabis joint with Tesla boss Elon Musk, after which the company's stocks fell by 9%.Rogan has been credited as being an ""unlikely political influencer"" by the New York Times, due to his reach. In January, he informed his legions of followers that he would ""probably vote for Bernie"", referring to the then Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders, who received increased press coverage as a result.However, since Joe Biden became the party's presumptive nominee, Rogan has said he is more likely to vote for President Trump.The kind of figures involved in the deal are incredibly rare in the podcast world - and Rogan will now likely earn more money than most musicians on Spotify.""Joe Rogan just got paid the equivalent value of over 26 billion streams for a podcast licence,"" wrote Tom Gray, director of the royalties, music copyright and licensing society, PRS for Music.""A musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights."" added music writer Ted Gioia.Gioia suggested this means ""Spotify values Rogan more than any musician in the history of the world"".TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan predicted the deal could ""lead the way to others"", but noted that the exclusivity clause would leave many fans locked out.""It might do what Sky did for a lot of shows,"" he tweeted. ""Lift them up, but put them behind a wall that the culture mostly then ignores.""Although Rogan has said the podcast will still be free to access, Spotify will be hoping the increased traffic to its service will lead to a significant increase in subscriber numbers.It is generally difficult to make large amounts of money in the crowded world of podcasts. As most podcasts are free to download, many presenters and producers attempt to make money from endorsements and advertising. A platform-exclusive deal such as this is very rare.

Tenet: Trailer for Christopher Nolan film arrives minus release date,"A second trailer for Christopher Nolan's mysterious new film Tenet has been released, giving more clues about its complex time travel narrative.Unlike the teaser trailer released in December, however, the new promo does not end with confirmation of the film's scheduled 17 July release date.The trailer instead merely states it will be ""coming to theaters"" [sic].The three-minute trailer was launched on popular video game Fortnite before being made available elsewhere.Cinemas around the world are closed due to the coronavirus pandemic and it is unclear when they will reopen.Earlier this month the CEO of the Vue chain expressed hopes it will be able to reopen its cinemas in July.The Showcase cinemas chain said it was also ""working towards"" welcoming back customers at the beginning of that month.End of Youtube post  by Warner Bros. PicturesAccording to Fortnite publisher Epic Games, the idea to launch the trailer in the game ""came from a phone call with Christopher Nolan"".""We were all talking about our love of seeing new trailers in a THEATER and how sad we were that we can't do that right now - but how maybe this could be the next best thing,"" tweeted its creative director Donald Mustard.It has also been announced that one of Nolan's previous feature films will be screened inside the game later this year.The British director's other films include Inception, Interstellar and the Oscar-winning World War II film Dunkirk.He also directed the three films in the so-called Dark Knight trilogy - Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.According to Tenet's distributor Warner Bros, his new film is ""an action epic evolving from the world of international espionage"".Its stars include John David Washington from Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman, Twilight's Robert Pattinson and Sir Kenneth Branagh.According to the new trailer, Sir Kenneth - who also appeared in Dunkirk - plays a ""Russian national"" who can ""communicate with the future"".The trailer sees a character use the word ""inversion"" alongside scenes in which events appear to play out in reverse.The trailer features a car chase in which vehicles move both backwards and forwards, close-combat fights and shots of a plane crashing into a hangar.""This reversing of the flow of time,"" Washington's character is heard saying. ""Doesn't us being here now mean it never happened?""Reaction on Twitter has been broadly positive, with users variously describing it as ""stunning"", ""so good"" and ""iconic"".""This is Christopher Nolan's world and we're just living in it,"" tweeted another impressed commentator.Tenet's own Twitter page states categorically that the film will be ""coming to theaters"" on 17 July.That will be reassuring to cinema operators following the decision of some distributors to bypass theatrical distribution and release their films directly online.Universal released Trolls World Tour online in April, while Sir Kenneth's film version of Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl novel will premiere on the Disney+ streaming service next month.Before the coronavirus crisis caused cinemas and other entertainment venues to close their doors, the films had been scheduled to open theatrically in April and May respectively.",22 May 2020,entertainment

Lana Del Rey responds to accusations of racism,"Lana Del Rey has defended herself against accusations of racism, arising from a statement she made about double standards in the music industry.In a long Instagram post this week the singer claimed she had been depicted as anti-feminist, despite singing about similar themes as other female artists.But some fans remarked the examples she chose - among them Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé - were mainly black women.Responding on Instagram, Del Rey said: ""Don't ever ever ever call me racist.""She went on: ""The singers I mentioned are my favourite singers so if you want to try and make a bone to pick out of that, like you always do be my guest.""It doesn't change the fact that I haven't had the same opportunity to express what I wanted to express without being completely decimated.""If you want to say that that has something to do with race that's your opinion but that's not what I was saying.""In her original post, Del Rey claimed she had been branded an anti-feminist pariah while ""Doja Cat, Ariana, Camila, Cardi B, Kehlani and Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé"" had all sung about ""being sexy, wearing no clothes... cheating, etc"" without facing similar criticism.Many people suggested the comments were tone deaf, with many wondering why the star had mostly cited women of colour.""Think Lana's post would have been fine if she hadn't compared herself to a group of mostly black women with the clear tone that she thinks she's been treated worse by the media when that's observably untrue,"" wrote Shon Faye on Twitter.""Lana blatantly ignoring the criticism Beyoncé, Nicki, and other black women have received (and continue to) for being confident in their sexuality doesn't sit right with me,"" added another user, simply calling themselves C.""Commercial success hasn't made them exempt from misogynistic attacks masked as constructive criticism.""""Even if she made a point, the inclusion of other women was so unnecessary and the fact the women were mostly black has left a bad taste,"" added journalist Toni Tone. ""The lines and adjectives also read like she's implying those women aren't as graceful, delicate or feminine as her. It's a messy statement.""The Guardian's Laura Snapes also responded with a column in which she said Del Rey's ""swipes at her peers of colour undermine her feminist argument"".Yet Del Rey was unrepentant and suggested her comments were being wilfully misinterpreted.""This is sad to make it about a WOC [women of colour] issue when I'm talking about my favourite singers,"" she wrote.""I could've literally said anyone but I picked my favourite people. And this is the problem with society today, not everything is about whatever you want it to be. ""It's exactly the point of my post - there are certain women that culture doesn't want to have a voice. ""It may not have to do with race. I don't know what it has to do with. I don't care anymore but don't ever, ever, ever, ever bro - call me racist because that is bull.""",22 May 2020,entertainment
