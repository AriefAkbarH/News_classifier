Brian May says he was 'very near death' after a heart attack,"Queen guitarist Brian May has revealed he ""could have died"" after being rushed to hospital following a heart attack.The 72-year-old said he was ""shocked"" to discover he needed surgery after what he described as a ""small"" heart attack earlier this month.The star's heart scare came a few days after a separate medical issue, when he thought he had ripped his glutes during a gardening accident.He explained his latest health problem in a video posted to Instagram.""I thought I was a very healthy guy,"" he said.""But I turned out to have three arteries that were congested and in danger of blocking the supply of blood to my heart.""May was subsequently fitted with three stents - tiny tubes that can hold open blocked arteries - and says he is back in full health.""I walked out with a heart that's very strong now, so I think I'm in good shape for some time to come."" Hmm ... Sheer Heart Attack eh ?  Well, I think I always worried a little bit about that album title. I wondered if it might upset some people who had actually had heart attacks. I’m actually quite relieved now that I’m in that club - and I don’t find it upsetting at all !  Take. care folks. And ... why did those discs in my spine get so squished?  Well I think 50 years of running around with a guitar strap over my left shoulder holding a heavy guitar might have something to do with it !  But it probably WAS all worth it ! BriA post shared by  Brian Harold May (@brianmayforreal) on May 24, 2020 at 7:42pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by brianmayforrealThe star made headlines earlier this month when he posted that he had torn a muscle in his gluteus maximus during a gardening accident.The injury left him in ""relentless pain,"" which he later discovered was due to another injury.""I told you I had a ripped muscle,"" he said in the seven-minute video he posted titled ""Sheer Heart Attack"" - a reference to the title of Queen's third album, released in 1974.""That was the way I was diagnosed and we thought it was like a bizarre gardening accident. ""I didn't realise that was amusing, really. I kind of forgot anything to do with the bum people find amusing... but anyway, it turned out to be not really the case. ""Now a week later I'm still in agony. I mean real agony. I wanted to jump at some points. I could not believe the pain. And people were saying, 'That's not like a ripped muscle, you don't get that amount of pain,' so eventually I had another MRI.'But this time I had one of the lower spine and, sure enough, what did we discover but I had a compressed sciatic nerve, quite severely compressed, and that's why I had the feeling that someone was putting a screwdriver in my back the whole time. It was excruciating.""So finally we started treating the thing for what it was. I'd been putting the ice packs in the wrong place for about 10 days.'That's one side of the story, and I'm a lot better now... But the rest of the story is a little more bizarre and a bit more shocking. ""I thought I was a very healthy guy. Everyone says, 'You've got a great blood pressure, you've got a great heart rate'. And I keep fit, I bike, good diet, not too much fat.""Anyway, I had - in the middle of the whole saga of the painful backside - I had a small heart attack. ""It's not something that did me any harm. It was about 40 minutes of pain in the chest and tightness, and that feeling in the arms and sweating.""Having realised he was having a heart attack, he called his doctor, who drove him to hospital for tests that exposed his underlying health problems.Given the choice between open heart surgery and having stents fitted, the musician chose the latter, and said the operation was remarkably straightforward.The star added that his experience should be a lesson to other people in their ""autumn years"".""What seems to be a very healthy heart may not be, and I would get it checked if I were you,"" he said. ""I was actually very near death [but] I didn't die. I came out and I would have been full of beans if it hadn't been for the leg.""May's health scare came shortly after Queen released a new version of We Are The Champions to raise money for the World Health Organization's Covid-19 fund.The single was renamed You Are The Champions as a tribute to medical staff, and was recorded under lockdown.",25 May 2020,entertainment

I'm not going to minimise the logistical problems we have faced in getting the right protective gear to the right people at the right time, both in the NHS and in care homes.""He added: ""Everyone responsible for tackling these problems is throwing everything at it, heart and soul, night and day, to get it right. And we're making huge progress.""May was speaking as Queen released a new version of their hit single We Are The Champions in support of frontline healthcare workers.Re-titled You Are The Champions, the single was put together under lockdown with May and drummer Roger Taylor playing in London, and touring singer Adam Lambert recording his vocals in LA.Proceeds will go to the World Health Organisation's Covid-19 fund, which supports medics around the world.""As a father with a daughter in the front line, I am ultra aware of the vital work they are doing daily to save us and our society,"" said Taylor, whose daughter is a GP in London.""Their bravery and sacrifice must not be prejudiced by anything less than a 100% effort by our governments to protect them. They are precious to us all and they are truly our champions.""The band are not the only musicians hoping to raise money efforts for healthcare staff during the coronavirus pandemic.Colonel Tom Moore and Michael Ball reached number one last week with their charity cover of You'll Never Walk Alone, while Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden has recorded a new version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow.Britpop bands including Dodgy, The Seahorses and Menswear have joined forces to re-record Shed Seven's Chasing Rainbows. And indie acts such as Wolf Alice,  Foals, and The Wombats have also put together a one-off vinyl album, with the aim of raising £30,000 to buy respirators for NHS Trusts in England and Scotland.Queen's single came about after the band's tour was postponed due to the coronavirus earlier this year.""I isolated very early on,"" May told the BBC. ""To me, it was a no brainer.""This virus was about to invade, the only weapon we had was to have less human interaction. So I thought, I'm doing it for the sake of my own health and for the sake of my family, and for the sake of everyone, really.""To pass the time, he started sharing tutorials on how to play some of Queen's most popular songs,  including Bohemian Rhapsody, on Instagram.Those lessons morphed into jam sessions with fans; and eventually May teamed up with Taylor to play We Are The Champions. The guitarist said he had an ""inkling"" it could become something bigger, but it wasn't until Lambert added his vocals that the plan crystallised.""I sent an email round to everyone and said, 'You know, we can change the odd word, if we like, to make it mean something different,' and we had the medics in mind because we're out there clapping every Thursday night.""So I thought, 'Well, what can you change? Should it be like. 'You've paid your dues?' ""[Then] Adam went in there and he just changed those couple of words in the last chorus.

You are the warriors that are saving humanity on this planet.""The single, which is released on Friday 1 May, stems from those original sessions, with overdubs from May and Queen's touring bassist Neil Fairclough.""It was all recorded on iPhones and laptops,"" May confessed. ""But it  just shows you don't have to have a multi-million dollar studio to make a record.""Coincidentally, We Are The Champions was originally inspired by You'll Never Walk Alone, which has become an unofficial anthem of unity during the coronavirus pandemic.At the height of their success in 1977, the band played a gig at Bingley Hall in Stafford - and when singer Freddie Mercury left the stage, the crowd started singing the Rodgers & Hammerstein song in the hope of getting an encore.""I can still remember Freddie's face going, 'What is this?

The Archers returns with a lockdown twist,"The Archers will return to Radio 4 on Monday, with a ""new style"" forced upon the show by the coronavirus lockdown.Large cast recordings with interaction between multiple characters have been scrapped in favour of monologues recorded at the actors' homes.""It might take a few episodes for listeners to get used to the new style"", said Charlotte Martin, who has plays busybody Susan Martin.""It will be different [but] I think it will be enjoyable,"" she said.The rural drama resumes at 19:00 BST on Radio 4, after a three-week break in which classic episodes kept listeners in touch with the residents of Ambridge.The first voice to be heard in the ""lockdown era"" will be Tim Bentinck, who plays David Archer. The actor said he was ""incredibly proud"" to be pioneering the new format.""As from Monday, the story of the now-virus-hit Ambridge will be told from the minds of the village characters, in a way that has never been heard in all its sixty-nine years,"" he wrote on Twitter.I'm incredibly proud to be the first Archers cast member to be heard in its new format. As from Monday, the story of the now virus-hit Ambridge will be told from the minds of the village characters, in a way that has never been heard in all its sixty-nine years.End of Twitter post  by @timbentinckFor the first time, listeners will get to hear what the characters ""really think"", he continued.""As actors, we're always after the sub-text - what we say is not necessarily what we mean. Now, what we think is not necessarily what we say!""Although the characters will be subject to the same restrictions as the rest of the UK, the plot won't focus solely on coronavirus - with upcoming episodes featuring storylines about Tracy and Harrison competing to become captain of the village cricket team, and a minor emergency caused by a broken down forage harvester. Last week, the series' editor Jeremy Howe revealed how coronavirus had thrown the soap's plans into disarray.""We binned 12 scripts and five weeks' worth of storylines that were about to be written,"" he told Radio Times. ""We then started inventing stories that were set in Ambridge, where the coronavirus had now arrived, that could be told in a way that both reflected the lockdown and could be recorded in the cast's homes.

Prince Charles issues warning on the arts,"The Prince of Wales has raised concerns about how orchestras and theatres will survive the coronavirus crisis.Many theatres and concert halls are struggling after closing their doors during lockdown, with no clear indication of when shows might resume,Prince Charles said it was important to ""find a way of keeping these orchestras and other arts bodies going"".The prince, who is patron of dozens of arts institutions, noted they were of ""enormous importance"" to the economy.""It's absolutely crucial that they can come back twice as enthusiastic as before,"" he said in an interview with Classic FM.The heads of the National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and the Southbank Centre have all warned they are facing financial collapse without additional government assistance due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Royal Opera House, of which Prince Charles is a patron, says it has seen 60% of house income fall away since the start of the crisis.""They're in terrible difficulties, of course, because how are they going to be able to restart?"" said the prince.""It is a very expensive art form, but it is crucial because it has such a worldwide impact... and so we have to find a way to make sure these marvellous people and organisations are going to survive through all this.""The 71-year-old, who spent a week in self-isolation after testing positive for coronavirus in March, was talking to Alan Titchmarsh for a special Classic FM programme celebrating his life-long love of classical music.He recalled his first visit to the Royal Opera House, in 1956, to see the Bolshoi Ballet perform The Fountain of Bakhchisarai in their debut tour of the UK.""The music was unbelievably exciting,"" he said. ""It was all Tartar dancing and cracking the whips and leaping in the air and doing unbelievably energetic things, which only the Bolshoi could do. ""I was completely inspired by that... Which is why it's so important, I think, for grandparents and other relations to take children at about the age of seven to experience some form of the arts in performance.""Elsewhere in the interview, the prince revealed he had helped Prince William curate the musical choices for his 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton.""I love trying to organise some interesting, I hope, pieces of music for certain occasions…particularly for weddings if people want,"" he said.""I know my eldest son was quite understanding and was perfectly happy for me to suggest a few pieces for their wedding.""""I hope that gave some people pleasure, but it's rather fun having orchestras in for great occasions like that, and why not suggest a few pieces occasionally?  Anyway... I do enjoy it.""The 2011 Royal Wedding service included pieces from Bach, Elgar, Britten and Vaughan Williams.Three of the pieces - Farewell to Stromness, Touch Her Soft Lips and Part and Romance for String Orchestra Op. 11 - were chosen specifically because they were played at the service of prayer and dedication at Charles and Camilla's wedding in 2005.",25 May 2020,entertainment
UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale; one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment
Lord Hall: People have turned to BBC 'in their droves' during pandemic,"People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic.He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home. The BBC could lose £125m in revenue because of coronavirus, he added.Lord Hall also said he recognised the need for a ""big debate"" about the future of the BBC and the way it is funded.The director general, who is set to leave his role in the summer, said younger audiences had been coming back to the BBC during the lockdown, with shows such as Normal People becoming huge hits.The corporation said that 94% of the British public used the BBC in the third week of March when social distancing began in the UK - with 86% of younger people between the ages of 16-34 also accessing BBC content. Lord Hall also credited this success to its ""biggest ever educational programme"", as well the launch of Culture in Quarantine - an arts and culture service which Lord Hall says keeps ""the arts alive in people's homes and support the arts sector during challenging times"".He was pressed on plans to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel, four years after it was taken off air and moved online to save costs.Lord Hall said the initial plans had been a ""fantastic, creative success"" and showed ""the importance of developing our iPlayer, developing our sounds and making sure that our new services are in tip top position for young audiences to come to"".However, he acknowledged that the broadcaster could potentially lose £125m as a result of coronavirus, meaning it would have to spend ""wisely"" in future. The BBC is facing financial pressure after being forced to delay the end of the free TV licence scheme for all over-75s.It also had to postpone plans to cut 450 jobs, and said there was uncertainty around commercial revenues.Lord Hall said that he hopes in future, there will be a ""big debate"" about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the current charter comes to an end. He said: ""The question is, what's the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share.""I hope even when I've left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone.""It comes after a public consultation was launched by the government on whether failure to pay for a TV licence should stop being a criminal offence, with the BBC warning it would cost the corporation more than £1bn over five years.",24 May 2020,entertainment
The Joe Rogan Experience: Will Gompertz reviews episode #1470 with Elon Musk ★★★☆☆,"They used to say everybody had a book in them. Then it changed to everybody had a blog in them. Now, everybody has a podcast in them. And that's just where the book-blog-pod should stay in 99.9% of cases. But there are handful of people who have taken to podcasting like Luke Skywalker to a lightsaber and become masters of cyberspace broadcasting. Elizabeth Day has gone from journalist to novelist to prominent media figure with her How To Fail podcast. George The Poet has cut through with his meditative musings, while the footballer Peter Crouch has turned into a surprise comedy star with his laddish tales from the locker-room. In America - where the art of podcasting was honed with shows like Serial, This American Life and Radiolab - the medium has long had a seat at the top table of the entertainment business. As was made evident this week with the announcement that the Swedish streaming service Spotify had paid a huge sum of money - the Wall Street Journal reported the deal could be worth around $100 million (£82 million) - for exclusive rights to a Californian-based podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan is a famous personality in the US. He first made his name as a stand-up comic, then turned to acting, before hosting a TV show featuring wince-inducing dares, and between all this established himself as a respected mixed martial arts UFC commentator. He started his eponymous podcast in 2009 as a ""mates chatting"" sort of thing, which it basically still is, although some of his mates are now Senators and Harvard professors. Anyway, it works: the show is said to have over 190 million monthly downloads, which is a lot of listeners by any measure (it is also available for free on YouTube, for now).I visited his website to hear what all the fuss was about, and chose episode #1470 from a couple of weeks ago, in which Rogan chats to Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla car boss. He'd had Musk on the show before, offered him a puff on his joint (cannabis is legal in the state where the show is made), which Elon duly accepted, leading to headlines and a sharp drop in Tesla's share price. The episode I listened to didn't have any such incidents. The two men began by chewing the fat about Musk's newly-born baby, to whom the businessman and his partner had given a name that sounded like a line of code written by one of his company's boffs. Rogan was amused and enthusiastic as the conversation gently meandered towards the topic of connecting computers to our brains, a concept that appeared to enthral and appal the host in equal measure.Not so the quietly-spoken Musk, who considered the prospect of a ""whole brain interface"" where ""more of you would be in the cloud than in your body"", to be viable within decades. Don't worry if that seems like too long to wait, because he also thought if all went to plan, that in five years we won't have to talk anymore because we'll be able to communicate our unfettered thoughts through neural links. These were not small things to posit given the obvious ramifications, particularly for The Joe Rogan Experience: no talking, no podcast. But our host didn't seem concerned or particularly interested in interrogating the breezy claims his guest made with a matter-of-factness that equated to someone putting a live grenade in your hand and mentioning, by-the-by, it could be quite dangerous. That's not to say Rogan was disengaged. It's just that his natural curiosity tended to stop at wow without getting to why. Which is fine, that's the nature of the show: guests are allowed to talk as much and as long as they like, often for hours, with Rogan the interlocutor playing the role of everyman: a part he has nailed better than almost anyone else in the world of podcasts, if one was judging by numbers alone (downloads, YouTube views, Instagram followers etc.).He is, as they say nowadays, relatable. His listeners get him, like him; maybe even want to be him. He's not a show-pony, or a light-entertainment phoney: he's the all-American do it yourself modern man, tough but intelligent. Joe Rogan is the Bruce Springsteen of chat.The Boss has taken his brand global, whether Rogan can repeat the feat in the talk-show genre will be interesting to see. The two men have much in common. They share the same muscular male aesthetic, with a love of T-shirts and no BS. They're both from New Jersey. They both had troubled relationships with their fathers - Springsteen's dad was a bus driver, Rogan's a cop. And they both found fame as the front man on stage.Given the size of its investment, Spotify must be hoping Rogan can compete with Springsteen in terms of reach and appeal. I'm not so sure he can having listened to his show. Songs can be reinterpreted, meaning can morph and be personalised - less so with chat, which tends to be specific to the host and his or her culture. I quite enjoyed listening to his conversation with Musk, but I wouldn't download another show in a rush for entertainment's sake. It wasn't just because the entrepreneur could say almost anything without being challenged - there's a section about Covid-19 when I found my eyebrows rise while Joe's and Elon's were furrowed in agreement (I believe in previous episodes Rogan has been more sceptical). The main problem is my cultural reference points are different, I don't relate to Joe Rogan. I'm not interested in mixed martial arts or conspiracy theories or smoking weed or drinking hard liquor or camping or ""dumb things"". I don't care if a Tesla car can accelerate to 60 mph in under two seconds or want to hear what Elon Musk has to say to ""all the fools out there"" - another throwaway remark that went unchallenged.Nevertheless, the host clearly reflects the views and tastes of a vast number of American people, and has developed a format with which they can connect and hear his thoughts and those of his guests (male-skewed, judging by the recent roster). And that's why I will continue to download his show: Not to be amused but to be informed.  Listen to The Joe Rogan Experience and you hear America.

Brian May says he was 'very near death' after a heart attack,"Queen guitarist Brian May has revealed he ""could have died"" after being rushed to hospital following a heart attack.The 72-year-old said he was ""shocked"" to discover he needed surgery after what he described as a ""small"" heart attack earlier this month.The star's heart scare came a few days after a separate medical issue, when he thought he had ripped his glutes during a gardening accident.He explained his latest health problem in a video posted to Instagram.""I thought I was a very healthy guy,"" he said.""But I turned out to have three arteries that were congested and in danger of blocking the supply of blood to my heart.""May was subsequently fitted with three stents - tiny tubes that can hold open blocked arteries - and says he is back in full health.""I walked out with a heart that's very strong now, so I think I'm in good shape for some time to come."" Hmm ... Sheer Heart Attack eh ?  Well, I think I always worried a little bit about that album title. I wondered if it might upset some people who had actually had heart attacks. I’m actually quite relieved now that I’m in that club - and I don’t find it upsetting at all !  Take. care folks. And ... why did those discs in my spine get so squished?  Well I think 50 years of running around with a guitar strap over my left shoulder holding a heavy guitar might have something to do with it !  But it probably WAS all worth it ! BriA post shared by  Brian Harold May (@brianmayforreal) on May 24, 2020 at 7:42pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by brianmayforrealThe star made headlines earlier this month when he posted that he had torn a muscle in his gluteus maximus during a gardening accident.The injury left him in ""relentless pain,"" which he later discovered was due to another injury.""I told you I had a ripped muscle,"" he said in the seven-minute video he posted titled ""Sheer Heart Attack"" - a reference to the title of Queen's third album, released in 1974.""That was the way I was diagnosed and we thought it was like a bizarre gardening accident. ""I didn't realise that was amusing, really. I kind of forgot anything to do with the bum people find amusing... but anyway, it turned out to be not really the case. ""Now a week later I'm still in agony. I mean real agony. I wanted to jump at some points. I could not believe the pain. And people were saying, 'That's not like a ripped muscle, you don't get that amount of pain,' so eventually I had another MRI.'But this time I had one of the lower spine and, sure enough, what did we discover but I had a compressed sciatic nerve, quite severely compressed, and that's why I had the feeling that someone was putting a screwdriver in my back the whole time. It was excruciating.""So finally we started treating the thing for what it was. I'd been putting the ice packs in the wrong place for about 10 days.'That's one side of the story, and I'm a lot better now... But the rest of the story is a little more bizarre and a bit more shocking. ""I thought I was a very healthy guy. Everyone says, 'You've got a great blood pressure, you've got a great heart rate'. And I keep fit, I bike, good diet, not too much fat.""Anyway, I had - in the middle of the whole saga of the painful backside - I had a small heart attack. ""It's not something that did me any harm. It was about 40 minutes of pain in the chest and tightness, and that feeling in the arms and sweating.""Having realised he was having a heart attack, he called his doctor, who drove him to hospital for tests that exposed his underlying health problems.Given the choice between open heart surgery and having stents fitted, the musician chose the latter, and said the operation was remarkably straightforward.The star added that his experience should be a lesson to other people in their ""autumn years"".""What seems to be a very healthy heart may not be, and I would get it checked if I were you,"" he said. ""I was actually very near death [but] I didn't die. I came out and I would have been full of beans if it hadn't been for the leg.""May's health scare came shortly after Queen released a new version of We Are The Champions to raise money for the World Health Organization's Covid-19 fund.The single was renamed You Are The Champions as a tribute to medical staff, and was recorded under lockdown.",25 May 2020,entertainment
Coronavirus: Brian May says the shortage of PPE is 'horrendous',"Brian May says the failure to stockpile crucial protective equipment ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic is ""heartbreaking and horrendous"".The Queen star told the BBC he was ""angry and sad"" that healthcare workers were ""expected to go in and risk their lives"" without proper protection.""People have died. Young people who had their whole lives ahead of them. I find it absolutely heartbreaking,"" he said.The government said it was ""determined to overcome the challenges"" with PPE.A BBC Panorama investigation this week discovered that there were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government's pandemic stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK.More than 100 NHS and healthcare workers known to have died with the virus during the outbreak.""I think we as a nation have to be ashamed that we were not prepared,"" said May.On Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We're determined urgently to overcome those challenges that have become so infuriating. I'm not going to minimise the logistical problems we have faced in getting the right protective gear to the right people at the right time, both in the NHS and in care homes.""He added: ""Everyone responsible for tackling these problems is throwing everything at it, heart and soul, night and day, to get it right. And we're making huge progress.""May was speaking as Queen released a new version of their hit single We Are The Champions in support of frontline healthcare workers.Re-titled You Are The Champions, the single was put together under lockdown with May and drummer Roger Taylor playing in London, and touring singer Adam Lambert recording his vocals in LA.Proceeds will go to the World Health Organisation's Covid-19 fund, which supports medics around the world.""As a father with a daughter in the front line, I am ultra aware of the vital work they are doing daily to save us and our society,"" said Taylor, whose daughter is a GP in London.""Their bravery and sacrifice must not be prejudiced by anything less than a 100% effort by our governments to protect them. They are precious to us all and they are truly our champions.""The band are not the only musicians hoping to raise money efforts for healthcare staff during the coronavirus pandemic.Colonel Tom Moore and Michael Ball reached number one last week with their charity cover of You'll Never Walk Alone, while Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden has recorded a new version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow.Britpop bands including Dodgy, The Seahorses and Menswear have joined forces to re-record Shed Seven's Chasing Rainbows. And indie acts such as Wolf Alice,  Foals, and The Wombats have also put together a one-off vinyl album, with the aim of raising £30,000 to buy respirators for NHS Trusts in England and Scotland.Queen's single came about after the band's tour was postponed due to the coronavirus earlier this year.""I isolated very early on,"" May told the BBC. ""To me, it was a no brainer.""This virus was about to invade, the only weapon we had was to have less human interaction. So I thought, I'm doing it for the sake of my own health and for the sake of my family, and for the sake of everyone, really.""To pass the time, he started sharing tutorials on how to play some of Queen's most popular songs,  including Bohemian Rhapsody, on Instagram.Those lessons morphed into jam sessions with fans; and eventually May teamed up with Taylor to play We Are The Champions. The guitarist said he had an ""inkling"" it could become something bigger, but it wasn't until Lambert added his vocals that the plan crystallised.""I sent an email round to everyone and said, 'You know, we can change the odd word, if we like, to make it mean something different,' and we had the medics in mind because we're out there clapping every Thursday night.""So I thought, 'Well, what can you change? Should it be like. 'You've paid your dues?' ""[Then] Adam went in there and he just changed those couple of words in the last chorus. So instead of 'we are the champions it became 'you are the champions'.""We all went 'Yes, that's right. That's just a nice little subtle change'.""It means that we are all applauding you, because you are now the champions. You are the warriors that are saving humanity on this planet.""The single, which is released on Friday 1 May, stems from those original sessions, with overdubs from May and Queen's touring bassist Neil Fairclough.""It was all recorded on iPhones and laptops,"" May confessed. ""But it  just shows you don't have to have a multi-million dollar studio to make a record.""Coincidentally, We Are The Champions was originally inspired by You'll Never Walk Alone, which has become an unofficial anthem of unity during the coronavirus pandemic.At the height of their success in 1977, the band played a gig at Bingley Hall in Stafford - and when singer Freddie Mercury left the stage, the crowd started singing the Rodgers & Hammerstein song in the hope of getting an encore.""I can still remember Freddie's face going, 'What is this? We should be embracing it, we should be loving it and encouraging it,'"" May recalled.""So I think at that moment We Are The Champions was born, and We Will Rock You was born - because we were consciously involving our audience from that point on.""I love that. I love that about Queen and I'm proud of the fact that we've kind of generated a community in our audience. It's brilliant.""",1 May 2020,entertainment

And we're making huge progress.""May was speaking as Queen released a new version of their hit single We Are The Champions in support of frontline healthcare workers.Re-titled You Are The Champions, the single was put together under lockdown with May and drummer Roger Taylor playing in London, and touring singer Adam Lambert recording his vocals in LA.Proceeds will go to the World Health Organisation's Covid-19 fund, which supports medics around the world.""As a father with a daughter in the front line, I am ultra aware of the vital work they are doing daily to save us and our society,"" said Taylor, whose daughter is a GP in London.""Their bravery and sacrifice must not be prejudiced by anything less than a 100% effort by our governments to protect them. They are precious to us all and they are truly our champions.""The band are not the only musicians hoping to raise money efforts for healthcare staff during the coronavirus pandemic.Colonel Tom Moore and Michael Ball reached number one last week with their charity cover of You'll Never Walk Alone, while Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden has recorded a new version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow.Britpop bands including Dodgy, The Seahorses and Menswear have joined forces to re-record Shed Seven's Chasing Rainbows. And indie acts such as Wolf Alice,  Foals, and The Wombats have also put together a one-off vinyl album, with the aim of raising £30,000 to buy respirators for NHS Trusts in England and Scotland.Queen's single came about after the band's tour was postponed due to the coronavirus earlier this year.""I isolated very early on,"" May told the BBC. ""To me, it was a no brainer.""This virus was about to invade, the only weapon we had was to have less human interaction. So I thought, I'm doing it for the sake of my own health and for the sake of my family, and for the sake of everyone, really.""To pass the time, he started sharing tutorials on how to play some of Queen's most popular songs,  including Bohemian Rhapsody, on Instagram.Those lessons morphed into jam sessions with fans; and eventually May teamed up with Taylor to play We Are The Champions. The guitarist said he had an ""inkling"" it could become something bigger, but it wasn't until Lambert added his vocals that the plan crystallised.""I sent an email round to everyone and said, 'You know, we can change the odd word, if we like, to make it mean something different,' and we had the medics in mind because we're out there clapping every Thursday night.""So I thought, 'Well, what can you change? Should it be like. 'You've paid your dues?' ""[Then] Adam went in there and he just changed those couple of words in the last chorus. So instead of 'we are the champions it became 'you are the champions'.""We all went 'Yes, that's right. That's just a nice little subtle change'.""It means that we are all applauding you, because you are now the champions. You are the warriors that are saving humanity on this planet.""The single, which is released on Friday 1 May, stems from those original sessions, with overdubs from May and Queen's touring bassist Neil Fairclough.""It was all recorded on iPhones and laptops,"" May confessed. ""But it  just shows you don't have to have a multi-million dollar studio to make a record.""Coincidentally, We Are The Champions was originally inspired by You'll Never Walk Alone, which has become an unofficial anthem of unity during the coronavirus pandemic.At the height of their success in 1977, the band played a gig at Bingley Hall in Stafford - and when singer Freddie Mercury left the stage, the crowd started singing the Rodgers & Hammerstein song in the hope of getting an encore.""I can still remember Freddie's face going, 'What is this? We should be embracing it, we should be loving it and encouraging it,'"" May recalled.""So I think at that moment We Are The Champions was born, and We Will Rock You was born - because we were consciously involving our audience from that point on.""I love that. I love that about Queen and I'm proud of the fact that we've kind of generated a community in our audience. It's brilliant.""",1 May 2020,entertainment
Queen's Brian May rips glutes while gardening,"Brian May has said he is in ""relentless pain"" following a gardening mishap during lockdown.""I managed to rip my Gluteus Maximus to shreds in a moment of over-enthusiastic gardening,"" the Queen star explained in an Instagram post on Thursday.May said he had to go to hospital for a scan and would not be able to walk without assistance for a while.He said he would ""need a complete break"" while he recovered from the injury. Reality check ! For me. No - the Virus didn’t get me yet - thank God.  Hope you’re all keeping extra-safe out there.  A decision to relax controls doesn’t suddenly make the danger go away.  But me ?? Yes, I’ve been quiet.  Reason ? As well as getting over-stretched and harassed by too many demands ... I managed to rip my Gluteus Maximus to shreds in a moment of over-enthusiastic gardening.  So suddenly I find myself in a hospital getting scanned to find out exactly how much I’ve actually damaged myself.  Turns out I did a thorough job - this is a couple of days ago - and I won’t be able to walk for a while ... or sleep, without a lot of assistance, because the pain is relentless.  So, folks ... I need to go dark for a while, getting some complete rest, at home.  Please, please don’t send me sympathy - I just need some healing silence for a while. I’ll be back - but I need the complete break.  OK ?  Thanks.  Take care out there.

Prince Charles issues warning on the arts,"The Prince of Wales has raised concerns about how orchestras and theatres will survive the coronavirus crisis.Many theatres and concert halls are struggling after closing their doors during lockdown, with no clear indication of when shows might resume,Prince Charles said it was important to ""find a way of keeping these orchestras and other arts bodies going"".The prince, who is patron of dozens of arts institutions, noted they were of ""enormous importance"" to the economy.""It's absolutely crucial that they can come back twice as enthusiastic as before,"" he said in an interview with Classic FM.The heads of the National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and the Southbank Centre have all warned they are facing financial collapse without additional government assistance due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Royal Opera House, of which Prince Charles is a patron, says it has seen 60% of house income fall away since the start of the crisis.""They're in terrible difficulties, of course, because how are they going to be able to restart?"" said the prince.""It is a very expensive art form, but it is crucial because it has such a worldwide impact... and so we have to find a way to make sure these marvellous people and organisations are going to survive through all this.""The 71-year-old, who spent a week in self-isolation after testing positive for coronavirus in March, was talking to Alan Titchmarsh for a special Classic FM programme celebrating his life-long love of classical music.He recalled his first visit to the Royal Opera House, in 1956, to see the Bolshoi Ballet perform The Fountain of Bakhchisarai in their debut tour of the UK.""The music was unbelievably exciting,"" he said. ""It was all Tartar dancing and cracking the whips and leaping in the air and doing unbelievably energetic things, which only the Bolshoi could do. ""I was completely inspired by that...

UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale; one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment
Lord Hall: People have turned to BBC 'in their droves' during pandemic,"People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic.He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home. The BBC could lose £125m in revenue because of coronavirus, he added.Lord Hall also said he recognised the need for a ""big debate"" about the future of the BBC and the way it is funded.The director general, who is set to leave his role in the summer, said younger audiences had been coming back to the BBC during the lockdown, with shows such as Normal People becoming huge hits.The corporation said that 94% of the British public used the BBC in the third week of March when social distancing began in the UK - with 86% of younger people between the ages of 16-34 also accessing BBC content. Lord Hall also credited this success to its ""biggest ever educational programme"", as well the launch of Culture in Quarantine - an arts and culture service which Lord Hall says keeps ""the arts alive in people's homes and support the arts sector during challenging times"".He was pressed on plans to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel, four years after it was taken off air and moved online to save costs.Lord Hall said the initial plans had been a ""fantastic, creative success"" and showed ""the importance of developing our iPlayer, developing our sounds and making sure that our new services are in tip top position for young audiences to come to"".However, he acknowledged that the broadcaster could potentially lose £125m as a result of coronavirus, meaning it would have to spend ""wisely"" in future. The BBC is facing financial pressure after being forced to delay the end of the free TV licence scheme for all over-75s.It also had to postpone plans to cut 450 jobs, and said there was uncertainty around commercial revenues.Lord Hall said that he hopes in future, there will be a ""big debate"" about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the current charter comes to an end. He said: ""The question is, what's the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share.""I hope even when I've left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone.""It comes after a public consultation was launched by the government on whether failure to pay for a TV licence should stop being a criminal offence, with the BBC warning it would cost the corporation more than £1bn over five years.",24 May 2020,entertainment
The Joe Rogan Experience: Will Gompertz reviews episode #1470 with Elon Musk ★★★☆☆,"They used to say everybody had a book in them. Then it changed to everybody had a blog in them. Now, everybody has a podcast in them. And that's just where the book-blog-pod should stay in 99.9% of cases. But there are handful of people who have taken to podcasting like Luke Skywalker to a lightsaber and become masters of cyberspace broadcasting. Elizabeth Day has gone from journalist to novelist to prominent media figure with her How To Fail podcast. George The Poet has cut through with his meditative musings, while the footballer Peter Crouch has turned into a surprise comedy star with his laddish tales from the locker-room. In America - where the art of podcasting was honed with shows like Serial, This American Life and Radiolab - the medium has long had a seat at the top table of the entertainment business. As was made evident this week with the announcement that the Swedish streaming service Spotify had paid a huge sum of money - the Wall Street Journal reported the deal could be worth around $100 million (£82 million) - for exclusive rights to a Californian-based podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan is a famous personality in the US. He first made his name as a stand-up comic, then turned to acting, before hosting a TV show featuring wince-inducing dares, and between all this established himself as a respected mixed martial arts UFC commentator. He started his eponymous podcast in 2009 as a ""mates chatting"" sort of thing, which it basically still is, although some of his mates are now Senators and Harvard professors. Anyway, it works: the show is said to have over 190 million monthly downloads, which is a lot of listeners by any measure (it is also available for free on YouTube, for now).I visited his website to hear what all the fuss was about, and chose episode #1470 from a couple of weeks ago, in which Rogan chats to Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla car boss. He'd had Musk on the show before, offered him a puff on his joint (cannabis is legal in the state where the show is made), which Elon duly accepted, leading to headlines and a sharp drop in Tesla's share price. The episode I listened to didn't have any such incidents. The two men began by chewing the fat about Musk's newly-born baby, to whom the businessman and his partner had given a name that sounded like a line of code written by one of his company's boffs. Rogan was amused and enthusiastic as the conversation gently meandered towards the topic of connecting computers to our brains, a concept that appeared to enthral and appal the host in equal measure.Not so the quietly-spoken Musk, who considered the prospect of a ""whole brain interface"" where ""more of you would be in the cloud than in your body"", to be viable within decades. Don't worry if that seems like too long to wait, because he also thought if all went to plan, that in five years we won't have to talk anymore because we'll be able to communicate our unfettered thoughts through neural links. These were not small things to posit given the obvious ramifications, particularly for The Joe Rogan Experience: no talking, no podcast. But our host didn't seem concerned or particularly interested in interrogating the breezy claims his guest made with a matter-of-factness that equated to someone putting a live grenade in your hand and mentioning, by-the-by, it could be quite dangerous. That's not to say Rogan was disengaged. It's just that his natural curiosity tended to stop at wow without getting to why. Which is fine, that's the nature of the show: guests are allowed to talk as much and as long as they like, often for hours, with Rogan the interlocutor playing the role of everyman: a part he has nailed better than almost anyone else in the world of podcasts, if one was judging by numbers alone (downloads, YouTube views, Instagram followers etc.).He is, as they say nowadays, relatable. His listeners get him, like him; maybe even want to be him. He's not a show-pony, or a light-entertainment phoney: he's the all-American do it yourself modern man, tough but intelligent. Joe Rogan is the Bruce Springsteen of chat.The Boss has taken his brand global, whether Rogan can repeat the feat in the talk-show genre will be interesting to see. The two men have much in common. They share the same muscular male aesthetic, with a love of T-shirts and no BS. They're both from New Jersey. They both had troubled relationships with their fathers - Springsteen's dad was a bus driver, Rogan's a cop. And they both found fame as the front man on stage.Given the size of its investment, Spotify must be hoping Rogan can compete with Springsteen in terms of reach and appeal. I'm not so sure he can having listened to his show. Songs can be reinterpreted, meaning can morph and be personalised - less so with chat, which tends to be specific to the host and his or her culture. I quite enjoyed listening to his conversation with Musk, but I wouldn't download another show in a rush for entertainment's sake. It wasn't just because the entrepreneur could say almost anything without being challenged - there's a section about Covid-19 when I found my eyebrows rise while Joe's and Elon's were furrowed in agreement (I believe in previous episodes Rogan has been more sceptical). The main problem is my cultural reference points are different, I don't relate to Joe Rogan. I'm not interested in mixed martial arts or conspiracy theories or smoking weed or drinking hard liquor or camping or ""dumb things"". I don't care if a Tesla car can accelerate to 60 mph in under two seconds or want to hear what Elon Musk has to say to ""all the fools out there"" - another throwaway remark that went unchallenged.Nevertheless, the host clearly reflects the views and tastes of a vast number of American people, and has developed a format with which they can connect and hear his thoughts and those of his guests (male-skewed, judging by the recent roster). And that's why I will continue to download his show: Not to be amused but to be informed.  Listen to The Joe Rogan Experience and you hear America.

Prince Charles issues warning on the arts,"The Prince of Wales has raised concerns about how orchestras and theatres will survive the coronavirus crisis.Many theatres and concert halls are struggling after closing their doors during lockdown, with no clear indication of when shows might resume,Prince Charles said it was important to ""find a way of keeping these orchestras and other arts bodies going"".The prince, who is patron of dozens of arts institutions, noted they were of ""enormous importance"" to the economy.""It's absolutely crucial that they can come back twice as enthusiastic as before,"" he said in an interview with Classic FM.The heads of the National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and the Southbank Centre have all warned they are facing financial collapse without additional government assistance due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Royal Opera House, of which Prince Charles is a patron, says it has seen 60% of house income fall away since the start of the crisis.""They're in terrible difficulties, of course, because how are they going to be able to restart?"" said the prince.""It is a very expensive art form, but it is crucial because it has such a worldwide impact... and so we have to find a way to make sure these marvellous people and organisations are going to survive through all this.""The 71-year-old, who spent a week in self-isolation after testing positive for coronavirus in March, was talking to Alan Titchmarsh for a special Classic FM programme celebrating his life-long love of classical music.He recalled his first visit to the Royal Opera House, in 1956, to see the Bolshoi Ballet perform The Fountain of Bakhchisarai in their debut tour of the UK.""The music was unbelievably exciting,"" he said. ""It was all Tartar dancing and cracking the whips and leaping in the air and doing unbelievably energetic things, which only the Bolshoi could do. ""I was completely inspired by that... Which is why it's so important, I think, for grandparents and other relations to take children at about the age of seven to experience some form of the arts in performance.""Elsewhere in the interview, the prince revealed he had helped Prince William curate the musical choices for his 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton.""I love trying to organise some interesting, I hope, pieces of music for certain occasions…particularly for weddings if people want,"" he said.""I know my eldest son was quite understanding and was perfectly happy for me to suggest a few pieces for their wedding.""""I hope that gave some people pleasure, but it's rather fun having orchestras in for great occasions like that, and why not suggest a few pieces occasionally?  Anyway... I do enjoy it.""The 2011 Royal Wedding service included pieces from Bach, Elgar, Britten and Vaughan Williams.Three of the pieces - Farewell to Stromness, Touch Her Soft Lips and Part and Romance for String Orchestra Op. 11 - were chosen specifically because they were played at the service of prayer and dedication at Charles and Camilla's wedding in 2005.",25 May 2020,entertainment
UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale; one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment
Lord Hall: People have turned to BBC 'in their droves' during pandemic,"People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic.He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home. The BBC could lose £125m in revenue because of coronavirus, he added.Lord Hall also said he recognised the need for a ""big debate"" about the future of the BBC and the way it is funded.The director general, who is set to leave his role in the summer, said younger audiences had been coming back to the BBC during the lockdown, with shows such as Normal People becoming huge hits.The corporation said that 94% of the British public used the BBC in the third week of March when social distancing began in the UK - with 86% of younger people between the ages of 16-34 also accessing BBC content. Lord Hall also credited this success to its ""biggest ever educational programme"", as well the launch of Culture in Quarantine - an arts and culture service which Lord Hall says keeps ""the arts alive in people's homes and support the arts sector during challenging times"".He was pressed on plans to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel, four years after it was taken off air and moved online to save costs.Lord Hall said the initial plans had been a ""fantastic, creative success"" and showed ""the importance of developing our iPlayer, developing our sounds and making sure that our new services are in tip top position for young audiences to come to"".However, he acknowledged that the broadcaster could potentially lose £125m as a result of coronavirus, meaning it would have to spend ""wisely"" in future. The BBC is facing financial pressure after being forced to delay the end of the free TV licence scheme for all over-75s.It also had to postpone plans to cut 450 jobs, and said there was uncertainty around commercial revenues.Lord Hall said that he hopes in future, there will be a ""big debate"" about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the current charter comes to an end. He said: ""The question is, what's the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share.""I hope even when I've left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone.""It comes after a public consultation was launched by the government on whether failure to pay for a TV licence should stop being a criminal offence, with the BBC warning it would cost the corporation more than £1bn over five years.",24 May 2020,entertainment
The Joe Rogan Experience: Will Gompertz reviews episode #1470 with Elon Musk ★★★☆☆,"They used to say everybody had a book in them. Then it changed to everybody had a blog in them. Now, everybody has a podcast in them. And that's just where the book-blog-pod should stay in 99.9% of cases. But there are handful of people who have taken to podcasting like Luke Skywalker to a lightsaber and become masters of cyberspace broadcasting. Elizabeth Day has gone from journalist to novelist to prominent media figure with her How To Fail podcast. George The Poet has cut through with his meditative musings, while the footballer Peter Crouch has turned into a surprise comedy star with his laddish tales from the locker-room. In America - where the art of podcasting was honed with shows like Serial, This American Life and Radiolab - the medium has long had a seat at the top table of the entertainment business. As was made evident this week with the announcement that the Swedish streaming service Spotify had paid a huge sum of money - the Wall Street Journal reported the deal could be worth around $100 million (£82 million) - for exclusive rights to a Californian-based podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan is a famous personality in the US. He first made his name as a stand-up comic, then turned to acting, before hosting a TV show featuring wince-inducing dares, and between all this established himself as a respected mixed martial arts UFC commentator. He started his eponymous podcast in 2009 as a ""mates chatting"" sort of thing, which it basically still is, although some of his mates are now Senators and Harvard professors. Anyway, it works: the show is said to have over 190 million monthly downloads, which is a lot of listeners by any measure (it is also available for free on YouTube, for now).I visited his website to hear what all the fuss was about, and chose episode #1470 from a couple of weeks ago, in which Rogan chats to Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla car boss. He'd had Musk on the show before, offered him a puff on his joint (cannabis is legal in the state where the show is made), which Elon duly accepted, leading to headlines and a sharp drop in Tesla's share price. The episode I listened to didn't have any such incidents. The two men began by chewing the fat about Musk's newly-born baby, to whom the businessman and his partner had given a name that sounded like a line of code written by one of his company's boffs. Rogan was amused and enthusiastic as the conversation gently meandered towards the topic of connecting computers to our brains, a concept that appeared to enthral and appal the host in equal measure.Not so the quietly-spoken Musk, who considered the prospect of a ""whole brain interface"" where ""more of you would be in the cloud than in your body"", to be viable within decades. Don't worry if that seems like too long to wait, because he also thought if all went to plan, that in five years we won't have to talk anymore because we'll be able to communicate our unfettered thoughts through neural links. These were not small things to posit given the obvious ramifications, particularly for The Joe Rogan Experience: no talking, no podcast. But our host didn't seem concerned or particularly interested in interrogating the breezy claims his guest made with a matter-of-factness that equated to someone putting a live grenade in your hand and mentioning, by-the-by, it could be quite dangerous. That's not to say Rogan was disengaged. It's just that his natural curiosity tended to stop at wow without getting to why. Which is fine, that's the nature of the show: guests are allowed to talk as much and as long as they like, often for hours, with Rogan the interlocutor playing the role of everyman: a part he has nailed better than almost anyone else in the world of podcasts, if one was judging by numbers alone (downloads, YouTube views, Instagram followers etc.).He is, as they say nowadays, relatable. His listeners get him, like him; maybe even want to be him. He's not a show-pony, or a light-entertainment phoney: he's the all-American do it yourself modern man, tough but intelligent. Joe Rogan is the Bruce Springsteen of chat.The Boss has taken his brand global, whether Rogan can repeat the feat in the talk-show genre will be interesting to see. The two men have much in common. They share the same muscular male aesthetic, with a love of T-shirts and no BS. They're both from New Jersey. They both had troubled relationships with their fathers - Springsteen's dad was a bus driver, Rogan's a cop. And they both found fame as the front man on stage.Given the size of its investment, Spotify must be hoping Rogan can compete with Springsteen in terms of reach and appeal. I'm not so sure he can having listened to his show. Songs can be reinterpreted, meaning can morph and be personalised - less so with chat, which tends to be specific to the host and his or her culture. I quite enjoyed listening to his conversation with Musk, but I wouldn't download another show in a rush for entertainment's sake. It wasn't just because the entrepreneur could say almost anything without being challenged - there's a section about Covid-19 when I found my eyebrows rise while Joe's and Elon's were furrowed in agreement (I believe in previous episodes Rogan has been more sceptical). The main problem is my cultural reference points are different, I don't relate to Joe Rogan. I'm not interested in mixed martial arts or conspiracy theories or smoking weed or drinking hard liquor or camping or ""dumb things"". I don't care if a Tesla car can accelerate to 60 mph in under two seconds or want to hear what Elon Musk has to say to ""all the fools out there"" - another throwaway remark that went unchallenged.Nevertheless, the host clearly reflects the views and tastes of a vast number of American people, and has developed a format with which they can connect and hear his thoughts and those of his guests (male-skewed, judging by the recent roster). And that's why I will continue to download his show: Not to be amused but to be informed.  Listen to The Joe Rogan Experience and you hear America.

Ruby Rose leaves Batwoman - and other stars who exited major roles,"The Australian actress Ruby Rose is to leave her role as comic book superhero Batwoman after just one series.Rose said it had been a ""very difficult decision"" not to return to the show, which is shown in the UK on E4.Batwoman, which began on the CW network last year, is the first superhero show to have an openly gay lead character.Its producers said they were ""firmly committed"" to the show's ""long-term"" future and would re-cast the role with another member of the LGBTQ community.Rose, who is herself gay, said she was ""truly grateful... to everyone who made season one a success"". The 34-year-old said she had ""the utmost respect"" for everyone involved and that the decision to leave had not been ""made lightly"".Rose faced a backlash on social media when she was cast as Batwoman, with some saying the role should have gone to a lesbian actress.The actress, who has called herself ""gender-fluid"" in interviews, later deleted her Twitter profile, though she remains active on Instagram.Last year Rose revealed she had suffered an injury while filming the series that had required her to undergo emergency surgery.The actress said she had ""herniated two discs doing stunts"" - but Deadline reported the injury was not the reason for her departure.Born in Melbourne in 1986, Rose played Stella Carlin in Orange is the New Black and has appeared in such films as Pitch Perfect 3 and The Meg.Yet she is far from the first actor to leave or be replaced in a major film or TV show.George Lazenby famously walked away from the role of James Bond after making just one appearance in the popular spy film series.The model turned actor later admitted he had been persuaded by his then-manager - the late Ronan O'Rahilly - to seek other opportunities.""I thought he knew what he was talking about so I listened to him,"" the Australian told an audience at the National Film Theatre last year.Lazenby's single outing as Bond, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was released in 1969 and is now a firm fan favourite.Christopher Eccleston was cast as The Doctor when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 - but he departed after a single series.The actor, who was replaced by David Tennant, later said he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture"" of the show.""My relationship with my three immediate superiors... broke down irreparably during the first block of filming and it never recovered,"" he elaborated in 2018.The actor, currently to be seen in The A Word on BBC One, also said he had been ""out of his comfort zone"" playing the sci-fi drama's time-travelling hero.Edward Norton was cast as Bruce Banner in 2008's The Incredible Hulk but did not reprise the role in Marvel Studios' subsequent comic-book blockbusters.Its president Kevin Feige later said the role had been recast out of a ""need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members"".Speaking last year, Norton called Feige's 2010 statement ""cheap"" and that his exit had been the result of differing views on how to depict the character.""Ultimately they weren't going for long, dark and serious,"" said Norton, who was replaced by Mark Ruffalo when The Hulk returned in 2012's Avengers Assemble.Terrence Howard, who played James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes in 2008's Iron Man, is another actor to be replaced in Marvel's superhero film series.He later claimed he was offered less money than he had been promised to reprise the role, which Don Cheadle has played since 2010's Iron Man 2.Sharon Gless played Christine Cagney in Cagney and Lacey for seven years, winning two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for her pains.Yet she was not the first actress to play the part in the popular US TV series about two female police detectives solving crimes in New York City.Loretta Swit played Cagney in the original TV movie but was not able to continue in the role when the CBS show went to series.Meg Foster was then cast, only to be replaced after six episodes because CBS allegedly wanted someone ""more feminine"" in the role.Speaking in 2012, Gless praised her co-star Tyne Daly for ""welcoming me as if she had not had anybody before me"".""I know her heart was hurting because she loved her last Cagney,"" she revealed.When Men Behaving Badly first began in 1992, the two flatmates were played by Martin Clunes and Harry Enfield.According to Clunes, though, the show that ITV produced did not match Enfield's hopes for it.""His original vision was for it not to be like a usual sitcom,"" Clunes told The Guardian in 2013. ""Then we made the pilot and it shocked him.""You could see Harry wanted out,"" he continued. ""He was under contract, though, so had to do one series.""Neil Morrissey was subsequently cast as Clunes' flatmate in the show, which continued on ITV for another series before being picked up by the BBC.Jodie Foster earned her second best actress Oscar for playing Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs - one of five Academy Awards Jonathan Demme's film won in 1992.When the offer came to reprise her role in Hannibal, though, she turned it down - opening the door for Julianne Moore to appear with Anthony Hopkins in Ridley Scott's 2001 follow-up.""I stand to make more money doing that sequel than I've ever made in my life,"" Foster was quoted as saying in 1999. ""But who cares, if it betrays Clarice?""""The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie,"" she elaborated in 2005. ""So I get to say, in a nice, dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot.""Amusingly, however, Foster was enticed to reprise her FBI agent character in 2017 for a satirical sketch on Stephen Colbert's late-night US talk show.End of Youtube post  by The Late Show with Stephen ColbertYou may also like:",20 May 2020,entertainment
Why Joe Rogan's exclusive Spotify deal matters,"Joe Rogan has signed an exclusive deal with Spotify, which will see his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, disappear from all other platforms.The multi-year deal is believed to be worth $100m (£82 million), according to the Wall Street Journal.Rogan's podcast, which is one of the most popular in the world, will arrive on the streaming giant on 1 September.It will then be housed there exclusively by the end of the year, and removed from all other platforms.""It will remain free, and it will be the exact same show,"" said Rogan. ""It's just a licensing deal, so Spotify won't have any creative control over the show.""They want me to just continue doing it the way I'm doing it right now.""I'm excited to have the support of the largest audio platform in the world and I hope you folks are there when we make the switch!""Joe Rogan is a US stand-up comedian and TV host-turned-provocateur, who launched his podcast in 2009 - in the early days of the medium.He invites a wide range of guests, including actors, musicians, comedians, politicians and conspiracy theorists on to the show, which has garnered a huge audience. Last year the podcast was downloaded 190 million times per month.Rogan has previously advocated for ""long-form media"" - and his own podcast episodes regularly run to two or three hours.The controversial entertainer also has 8.42 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, which has up until now shown the interviews in video form (this will stop when the new Spotify deal kicks in).But he has also attracted criticism - Rogan has been accused of making sexist, racist and transphobic comments in his podcasts.""The Joe Rogan Experience has become one of the internet's foremost vectors for anti-wokeness,"" wrote Justin Peters in Slate.In 2018, Rogan's show hit the headlines when the host shared a cannabis joint with Tesla boss Elon Musk, after which the company's stocks fell by 9%.Rogan has been credited as being an ""unlikely political influencer"" by the New York Times, due to his reach. In January, he informed his legions of followers that he would ""probably vote for Bernie"", referring to the then Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders, who received increased press coverage as a result.However, since Joe Biden became the party's presumptive nominee, Rogan has said he is more likely to vote for President Trump.The kind of figures involved in the deal are incredibly rare in the podcast world - and Rogan will now likely earn more money than most musicians on Spotify.""Joe Rogan just got paid the equivalent value of over 26 billion streams for a podcast licence,"" wrote Tom Gray, director of the royalties, music copyright and licensing society, PRS for Music.""A musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights."" added music writer Ted Gioia.Gioia suggested this means ""Spotify values Rogan more than any musician in the history of the world"".TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan predicted the deal could ""lead the way to others"", but noted that the exclusivity clause would leave many fans locked out.""It might do what Sky did for a lot of shows,"" he tweeted. ""Lift them up, but put them behind a wall that the culture mostly then ignores.""Although Rogan has said the podcast will still be free to access, Spotify will be hoping the increased traffic to its service will lead to a significant increase in subscriber numbers.It is generally difficult to make large amounts of money in the crowded world of podcasts. As most podcasts are free to download, many presenters and producers attempt to make money from endorsements and advertising. A platform-exclusive deal such as this is very rare.

Brian May says he was 'very near death' after a heart attack,"Queen guitarist Brian May has revealed he ""could have died"" after being rushed to hospital following a heart attack.The 72-year-old said he was ""shocked"" to discover he needed surgery after what he described as a ""small"" heart attack earlier this month.The star's heart scare came a few days after a separate medical issue, when he thought he had ripped his glutes during a gardening accident.He explained his latest health problem in a video posted to Instagram.""I thought I was a very healthy guy,"" he said.""But I turned out to have three arteries that were congested and in danger of blocking the supply of blood to my heart.""May was subsequently fitted with three stents - tiny tubes that can hold open blocked arteries - and says he is back in full health.""I walked out with a heart that's very strong now, so I think I'm in good shape for some time to come.""

I’m actually quite relieved now that I’m in that club - and I don’t find it upsetting at all !  Take. care folks. And ... why did those discs in my spine get so squished?  Well I think 50 years of running around with a guitar strap over my left shoulder holding a heavy guitar might have something to do with it !  But it probably WAS all worth it ! BriA post shared by  Brian Harold May (@brianmayforreal) on May 24, 2020 at 7:42pm PDTEnd of Instagram post  by brianmayforrealThe star made headlines earlier this month when he posted that he had torn a muscle in his gluteus maximus during a gardening accident.The injury left him in ""relentless pain,"" which he later discovered was due to another injury.""I told you I had a ripped muscle,"" he said in the seven-minute video he posted titled ""Sheer Heart Attack"" - a reference to the title of Queen's third album, released in 1974.""That was the way I was diagnosed and we thought it was like a bizarre gardening accident. ""I didn't realise that was amusing, really. I kind of forgot anything to do with the bum people find amusing... but anyway, it turned out to be not really the case. ""Now a week later I'm still in agony. I mean real agony. I wanted to jump at some points. I could not believe the pain. And people were saying, 'That's not like a ripped muscle, you don't get that amount of pain,' so eventually I had another MRI.'But this time I had one of the lower spine and, sure enough, what did we discover but I had a compressed sciatic nerve, quite severely compressed, and that's why I had the feeling that someone was putting a screwdriver in my back the whole time. It was excruciating.""So finally we started treating the thing for what it was. I'd been putting the ice packs in the wrong place for about 10 days.'That's one side of the story, and I'm a lot better now... But the rest of the story is a little more bizarre and a bit more shocking. ""I thought I was a very healthy guy. Everyone says, 'You've got a great blood pressure, you've got a great heart rate'. And I keep fit, I bike, good diet, not too much fat.""Anyway, I had - in the middle of the whole saga of the painful backside - I had a small heart attack. ""It's not something that did me any harm. It was about 40 minutes of pain in the chest and tightness, and that feeling in the arms and sweating.""Having realised he was having a heart attack, he called his doctor, who drove him to hospital for tests that exposed his underlying health problems.Given the choice between open heart surgery and having stents fitted, the musician chose the latter, and said the operation was remarkably straightforward.The star added that his experience should be a lesson to other people in their ""autumn years"".""What seems to be a very healthy heart may not be, and I would get it checked if I were you,"" he said. ""I was actually very near death [but] I didn't die. I came out and I would have been full of beans if it hadn't been for the leg.""May's health scare came shortly after Queen released a new version of We Are The Champions to raise money for the World Health Organization's Covid-19 fund.The single was renamed You Are The Champions as a tribute to medical staff, and was recorded under lockdown.",25 May 2020,entertainment
The Archers returns with a lockdown twist,"The Archers will return to Radio 4 on Monday, with a ""new style"" forced upon the show by the coronavirus lockdown.Large cast recordings with interaction between multiple characters have been scrapped in favour of monologues recorded at the actors' homes.""It might take a few episodes for listeners to get used to the new style"", said Charlotte Martin, who has plays busybody Susan Martin.""It will be different [but] I think it will be enjoyable,"" she said.The rural drama resumes at 19:00 BST on Radio 4, after a three-week break in which classic episodes kept listeners in touch with the residents of Ambridge.The first voice to be heard in the ""lockdown era"" will be Tim Bentinck, who plays David Archer. The actor said he was ""incredibly proud"" to be pioneering the new format.""As from Monday, the story of the now-virus-hit Ambridge will be told from the minds of the village characters, in a way that has never been heard in all its sixty-nine years,"" he wrote on Twitter.I'm incredibly proud to be the first Archers cast member to be heard in its new format. As from Monday, the story of the now virus-hit Ambridge will be told from the minds of the village characters, in a way that has never been heard in all its sixty-nine years.End of Twitter post  by @timbentinckFor the first time, listeners will get to hear what the characters ""really think"", he continued.""As actors, we're always after the sub-text - what we say is not necessarily what we mean. Now, what we think is not necessarily what we say!""Although the characters will be subject to the same restrictions as the rest of the UK, the plot won't focus solely on coronavirus - with upcoming episodes featuring storylines about Tracy and Harrison competing to become captain of the village cricket team, and a minor emergency caused by a broken down forage harvester. Last week, the series' editor Jeremy Howe revealed how coronavirus had thrown the soap's plans into disarray.""We binned 12 scripts and five weeks' worth of storylines that were about to be written,"" he told Radio Times. ""We then started inventing stories that were set in Ambridge, where the coronavirus had now arrived, that could be told in a way that both reflected the lockdown and could be recorded in the cast's homes. ""I told the team - keep it simple.""For the actors, the lockdown meant recording their monologues at home in hastily-constructed makeshift studios.Annabelle Dowler, who plays Kirsty Miller, has been recording her scripts in her daughter's wardrobe, surrounded by duvets and and an old mattress to mask any external noises.  On her Twitter account, she shared a photo of the notice she'd attached to the wardrobe door, warning her children to keep their distance.""Stay away and be silent otherwise you will get into trouble with the BBC and we will have no iPlayer for the rest of the lockdown!""Heading into Ambridge today and seriously hoping they don’t follow me in. ⁦@BBCTheArchers⁩ pic.twitter.com/0g9qGNYCuREnd of Twitter post  by @AnnabelleDowlerHer co-star Charlotte Martin explained the challenges of recording in her bedroom. ""A studio is soundproof, whereas suddenly we were having to do it in our own homes,"" she said.""I've got my two daughters home and making sure everything is quiet, that nobody is opening doors, that was tricky. I think my husband came up the stairs at one point and we had to redo that!""She added that, as the crew adapt to new ways of recording the 69-year-old drama, they might be able to start incorporating more voices.""There may be ways that we can get actors talking to each other or create ways in which we can interact with more than one character at a time, but that will be in the future.""In the meantime, the lockdown has provided one character with a lucky escape.  Before the lockdown, Kirsty was due to marry handyman Philip Moss, who listeners recently discovered was an illegal gangmaster - employing slave labour in his building firm.For now, at least, those plans are on hold.",25 May 2020,entertainment
Prince Charles issues warning on the arts,"The Prince of Wales has raised concerns about how orchestras and theatres will survive the coronavirus crisis.Many theatres and concert halls are struggling after closing their doors during lockdown, with no clear indication of when shows might resume,Prince Charles said it was important to ""find a way of keeping these orchestras and other arts bodies going"".The prince, who is patron of dozens of arts institutions, noted they were of ""enormous importance"" to the economy.""It's absolutely crucial that they can come back twice as enthusiastic as before,"" he said in an interview with Classic FM.The heads of the National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and the Southbank Centre have all warned they are facing financial collapse without additional government assistance due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Royal Opera House, of which Prince Charles is a patron, says it has seen 60% of house income fall away since the start of the crisis.""They're in terrible difficulties, of course, because how are they going to be able to restart?"" said the prince.""It is a very expensive art form, but it is crucial because it has such a worldwide impact... and so we have to find a way to make sure these marvellous people and organisations are going to survive through all this.""The 71-year-old, who spent a week in self-isolation after testing positive for coronavirus in March, was talking to Alan Titchmarsh for a special Classic FM programme celebrating his life-long love of classical music.He recalled his first visit to the Royal Opera House, in 1956, to see the Bolshoi Ballet perform The Fountain of Bakhchisarai in their debut tour of the UK.""The music was unbelievably exciting,"" he said. ""It was all Tartar dancing and cracking the whips and leaping in the air and doing unbelievably energetic things, which only the Bolshoi could do. ""I was completely inspired by that... Which is why it's so important, I think, for grandparents and other relations to take children at about the age of seven to experience some form of the arts in performance.""Elsewhere in the interview, the prince revealed he had helped Prince William curate the musical choices for his 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton.""I love trying to organise some interesting, I hope, pieces of music for certain occasions…particularly for weddings if people want,"" he said.""I know my eldest son was quite understanding and was perfectly happy for me to suggest a few pieces for their wedding.""""I hope that gave some people pleasure, but it's rather fun having orchestras in for great occasions like that, and why not suggest a few pieces occasionally?  Anyway... I do enjoy it.""The 2011 Royal Wedding service included pieces from Bach, Elgar, Britten and Vaughan Williams.Three of the pieces - Farewell to Stromness, Touch Her Soft Lips and Part and Romance for String Orchestra Op. 11 - were chosen specifically because they were played at the service of prayer and dedication at Charles and Camilla's wedding in 2005.",25 May 2020,entertainment
Lord Hall: People have turned to BBC 'in their droves' during pandemic,"People have ""turned to the BBC in their droves"" in recent weeks, according to the BBC's director general. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Tony Hall said 94% of the UK accessed the BBC for ""information, entertainment or education"" during the pandemic.He said he ""took his hat off"" to staff who had created ""excellent"" content, even though 92% of the workforce were now working from home. The BBC could lose £125m in revenue because of coronavirus, he added.Lord Hall also said he recognised the need for a ""big debate"" about the future of the BBC and the way it is funded.The director general, who is set to leave his role in the summer, said younger audiences had been coming back to the BBC during the lockdown, with shows such as Normal People becoming huge hits.The corporation said that 94% of the British public used the BBC in the third week of March when social distancing began in the UK - with 86% of younger people between the ages of 16-34 also accessing BBC content. Lord Hall also credited this success to its ""biggest ever educational programme"", as well the launch of Culture in Quarantine - an arts and culture service which Lord Hall says keeps ""the arts alive in people's homes and support the arts sector during challenging times"".He was pressed on plans to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channel, four years after it was taken off air and moved online to save costs.Lord Hall said the initial plans had been a ""fantastic, creative success"" and showed ""the importance of developing our iPlayer, developing our sounds and making sure that our new services are in tip top position for young audiences to come to"".However, he acknowledged that the broadcaster could potentially lose £125m as a result of coronavirus, meaning it would have to spend ""wisely"" in future. The BBC is facing financial pressure after being forced to delay the end of the free TV licence scheme for all over-75s.It also had to postpone plans to cut 450 jobs, and said there was uncertainty around commercial revenues.Lord Hall said that he hopes in future, there will be a ""big debate"" about how the BBC should be funded post 2027, when the current charter comes to an end. He said: ""The question is, what's the best way of funding that universally so that everybody, this great democratic idea, gets something we can all share.""I hope even when I've left I can take part in that debate and we should look at the easiest way to pay, learn from what happens in other countries, are there fairer ways to pay, but the underpinning for all that is the idea of a BBC which is providing something for everyone.""It comes after a public consultation was launched by the government on whether failure to pay for a TV licence should stop being a criminal offence, with the BBC warning it would cost the corporation more than £1bn over five years.",24 May 2020,entertainment
UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale; one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment
