Joel Schumacher: Director of The Lost Boys and two Batman films dies,"Hollywood director Joel Schumacher, whose films included St Elmo's Fire, The Lost Boys and Flatliners, has died at the age of 80.The filmmaker was behind a string of big budget films in the 1980s and 1990s, including The Client and A Time to Kill, as well as two Batman sequels.Star Trek writer and producer Bryan Fuller and director Kevin Smith were among the first to pay tribute.""He couldn't have been nicer or more hospitable,"" Smith tweeted.""I distinctly remember feeling hopeful when I learned he was gay and out and that there may be a place for me yet,"" wrote Fuller.Kiefer Sutherland, who starred in The Lost Boys, tweeted that Schumacher's ""joy, spirit and talent will live on"".Schumacher's publicists said he had been ill with cancer for more than a year.Variety wrote that the director ""brought his fashion background"" to directing and captured the feel of an era with his ""stylish films"".The New York native first entered the film industry as a costume designer in the 1970s, working alongside luminaries such as Woody Allen.He went on to write the 1976 low-budget comedy Car Wash, as well as the screenplay for a film adaptation of the Broadway musical The Wiz.But his big break came in 1985, with his third feature film St Elmo's Fire, which he co-wrote and directed.Alongside The Breakfast Club, which came out in the same year, it became one of the seminal films of the Brat Pack era and launched Demi Moore's film career.His follow-up, The Lost Boys - about a group of young vampires in small-town California - became a cult favourite, and his 1990 hit Flatliners saw him again team up with Kiefer Sutherland.Schumacher worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts and Michael Douglas. He directed Douglas in 1993's Falling Down, which was nominated for the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious Palme D'Or.He took over the reins of the Batman franchise from Tim Burton in 1995, casting Val Kilmer as the Caped Crusader and Jim Carrey as the Riddler. The film grossed more than $300m worldwide.However, his second outing - Batman and Robin - starring George Clooney in the lead and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze was critically panned and nearly finished off Clooney's burgeoning film career.Schumacher was noted for his ability to pick out new talent and he was fundamental in establishing the careers of A-list stars such as Sutherland, Rob Lowe and Colin Farrell. He directed Farrell in 2000's Tigerland, the actor's first leading role, and later in Phone Booth.Schumacher's style came to the fore in two memorable music videos, Seal's Kiss From a Rose and INXS's Devil Inside.His 2004 film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera, which received three Oscar nominations despite lukewarm reviews, was among the last of his films.Schumacher was reportedly the composer's first choice as director, with Lord Lloyd Webber having admired his work with music on The Lost Boys.Most recently, in 2013, he took the helm on a couple of episodes of the first season of Netflix series House of Cards, before more or less retiring from working life.He once said: ""If you love a movie, there are hundreds of people who made it lovable for you. If you don't like it, blame the director. That's what our name's there for.""",22 June 2020,entertainment
"The Luminaries: Warm reviews, but was it (literally) too dark?","BBC One drama The Luminaries has attracted criticism from some viewers and critics for its darkly lit scenes.The first episode of the series, based on Eleanor Catton's Booker-winning novel, was praised in several reviews after its broadcast on Sunday night.But The Telegraph and The Independent were among those commenting on the difficulties viewing certain scenes.The show's director has previously said the dim lighting is deliberate and adds a ""sense of mystery and intrigue"".The first episode of The Luminaries was watched by an average live audience of 5.3 million - the second highest launch for a BBC drama so far this year after The Salisbury Poisonings.The Luminaries is set on New Zealand's South Island at the height of the 1860s gold rush, and Catton has adapted the book for the small screen herself.""Here we go again with one of the BBC's dark dramas,"" wrote Anita Singh of The Daily Telegraph after the first episode aired. ""I don't mean tonally, although The Luminaries is a tale of murder and weirdness. I mean, literally, dark. ""Look, I know they didn't have brilliant lighting in 19th Century New Zealand but help us out here, we can't see a thing. And it's not as if the rest of The Luminaries is particularly illuminating.""The Independent's Ed Cumming awarded the show four stars, but noted: ""Most things are unclear. The scene is gloomier than Wolf Hall in a candle shortage. ""We can discern echoing voices, gunshots, a warm-lit cabin, a travelling politician, a wounded Maori, but not much else.""In an otherwise positive review, The Sun's Jill Robinson said:  ""The first episode of the new drama wasn't perfect, as the flash-forward scenes were so dark, it was hard to tell what was happening.""This took some of the impact away from some key scenes, and so, at times, The Luminaries needs to be a little more illuminating, otherwise they risk the wrath of viewers.""Many viewers on social media also pointed out the dim lighting, with some saying they had to turn up their brightness while watching.However, director Claire McCarthy said in a previous interview the series was deliberately shot in this way.""The colour palette is more gothic and grounded in the shadows. We wanted a sense of mystery and intrigue and a kind of burnished golden world inside the interiors,"" she explained.""We were very influenced by gold and not only did we have to research how gold could be filmed, and how it would appear on screen, but also just the way that we would light largely through flame, candlelight and natural light. ""We were trying to inhabit the kind of world and the resources that they would have at that time so we embraced that as a visual aesthetic. We wanted there to be a visceral quality to the show, rather than it to feel typically period or dusty, and so there needed to be an energy and a dynamism to the way the camera captured the world.""This isn't the first time a BBC drama has attracted criticism for its dimly-lit scenes.The corporation's 2015 production of Wolf Hall received a similar response - with many viewers and critics complaining about the darkness while praising the show overall.Some critics did not let dim lighting deter them from giving the show a positive review overall.""It is glorious escapism, perfect for our times,"" wrote Lucy Mangan in The Guardian., awarding the first episode four stars.""A cracking, challenging read has become a cracking, unchallenging series and both do their jobs perfectly. Joy.""Characters-with-a-capital-C everywhere, more plot than you know what to do with, hares set running at every turn, lavish period detail and lighting replicating the novel's gorgeous staginess, and a convoluted murder-mystery.""Writing in The Radio Times, Flora Carr said ""All in all, Catton's choice to spin The Luminaries on its axis, with a new focus on the female perspective, feels fresh and needed.""The sprawling novel was always going to be a nightmare to adapt, but by reintroducing us to the story via characters we barely met the first time around, Catton has managed to breathe new life into her tale.""Den of Geek's Louisa Mellor agreed, writing: ""Catton has melted down her extraordinary novel and recast it into a new form, one that, despite some absence of heart, works far, far better than was ever destined. ""As the screenwriter adapting her own work, Catton has given The Luminaries a drastic rewrite, re-centring the story around the fate-pummelled romance of two of the novel's little-seen characters. The mystery and mysticism and complex connections are all still here, but bedded into a more stable set of events.""But in her review for The Telegraph, Singh said: ""It sounds odd to say that a period drama feels dated. But the BBC has been doing such great work of late with modern-day dramas - Normal People, last week's Salisbury Poisonings, the extraordinary I May Destroy You - that The Luminaries seemed a stuffy throwback by comparison. ""It doesn't help that this sort of thing is best suited to autumn, when the nights are drawing in, but has been plonked in the middle of the summer schedule.""In his review for The Independent, Cummings said: ""The Luminaries is luminous, at least when it's visible... Greed has rarely looked so good.""But, he added, the series ""feels crammed in... perhaps no production could fit so much plot into so limited a form.""""There's one lesson from art that would be lost on prospectors: less can be more. In trying to tell such a complex story, The Luminaries risks swamping its viewers. There's gold in those all-black hills, but as in every bonanza, it's hard to tell how much.""The Luminaries, broke two records when it won the Booker Prize in 2013. At 27 years old, Eleanor Catton became the youngest ever winner, while the novel itself was the longest ever book to win, running at more than 800 pages. ",22 June 2020,entertainment

What I found was something different: an organisation that had ambitious goals for diversity and inclusion but didn't know how to reach them.""She believes the commitment ""will help to drive real change that will be felt by all audiences"".""I'm pleased that we're announcing this fund as the first of a series of bold steps that will help make the BBC an instrument of real change.""""As a black woman,"" she added, ""I feel and share in the pain that so many are feeling worldwide.""It makes it all the more important that we show up now not just with words but with meaningful action.""The cash injection will support diversity and inclusion across all genres of TV, including Children's, Education and Current Affairs.The BBC is calling it ""the biggest financial investment to on-air inclusion in the industry"", declaring that ""the media industry is not changing fast enough"".""The measures announced today are designed to accelerate the pace of change in increasing diversity and inclusion both on and off air,"" the statement read.Speaking to The Observer on Sunday, director Steve McQueen led the attack on racism in the British film and TV industry and the lack of diversity.""It's just not healthy,"" said Sir Steve. ""It's wrong. And yet, many people in the industry go along with it as if it is normal. It's not normal. It is anything but normal. It's blindingly, obviously wrong. It's blatant racism. Fact. I grew up with it.""The BBC's director of content, Charlotte Moore, said McQueen challenged her and the organisation to ""set meaningful targets and take proper action"" last year during the making of his upcoming anthology series, Small Axe.""He was right,"" said Moore. ""Today's announcement represents a truly transformational commitment to both on and off screen representation.""Concrete, tangible action is the only way we can bring about real sustainable change.""Meanwhile, actors including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michaela Coel and Noel Clarke, as well as David Oyelowo and Meera Syal, have signed an open letter demanding that the UK film and TV industry will now ""put its money and practices where its mouth is"".The document, revealed on Monday, has more than 4,000 signatures, including those of presenter Anita Rani and directors Asif Kapadia, Gurinder Chadha and Rapman.",22 June 2020,entertainment
Michaela Coel's consent drama I May Destroy You gets rave reviews,"Michaela Coel's new 12-part drama has won plaudits from critics after it made its debut on BBC One on Monday.I May Destroy You charts the fallout from a sexual assault which occurs after protagonist Arabella - played by Coel - has her drink spiked.Coel, who wrote and co-directed the series, has previously revealed she was a victim of sexual assault herself.The Guardian's Lucy Mangan called the show a ""breathtaking achievement"", and it could be the year's best drama.Her five-star review said: ""This is going to be a rave review, because I May Destroy You is an astonishing, beautiful, thrilling series - a sexual consent drama if you want the one-line pitch, but so, so much more than that. It works on every level.""It is, in short, an extraordinary, breathtaking achievement without a false note in it, shot through with humour and with ideas, talent and character to burn at every perfectly plotted turn.""The Telegraph's Anita Singh concurred, giving the drama four stars. ""What you do not expect from this story is humour,"" she wrote.""Yet Coel has pulled off the seemingly impossible by creating a drama that is frequently funny. We have seen the aftermath of rape on television many times - the scene in the shower, the visit to police, the swabs, examinations and interviews.""I May Destroy You is not like that. What Coel seems to be saying is that trauma doesn't erase the essence of you.""In a recent interview, Coel described how humour was an inevitable part of her work even when dealing with such serious subject matter.""I didn't add humour, humour is always there; at every party, funeral and war, although often uninvited, she's always there,"" she said.""I, for some reason, I always seem to find myself in a corner with her, even when in a police station giving a witness statement about being raped by a stranger. I've come to accept she'll be in everything I do.""The Independent's Isobel Lewis gave another five-star review.She wrote: ""No TV show has ever shown the complexities of sexual assault and how it affects survivors, their friends and their communities quite like this difficult, harrowing and hilarious drama.""Metro's Cydney Yeates gave the show four-and-a-half stars, saying Coel ""manages to capture the fraught anxiety of Arabella's circumstance"".She added: ""She also succeeded in making Arabella a deeply flawed character who we want to shake in one moment, but protect her by all means necessary in the next.""The Evening Standard's Katie Strick gave the drama four stars, writing that the first 30-minute episode ""lays the foundations for some complex storylines from race to consent"".She continued: ""The assault itself is just the start. Coel says the incident changed her life and it certainly does for her character. Perhaps seeing it played out on screen will help change some viewers' lives, too.""Carol Midgley, writing in The Times, was not quite as enamoured, giving the episode three stars. The BBC had given Coel ""free rein and no restrictions"", she said.""Sometimes it showed. While her performance was excellent, the first episode often felt unfocused and scattered, with maybe 12 or 13 characters introduced in the first 23 minutes, which is a lot to process.""In the US, Vanity Fair writer Sonia Saraiya said Coel ""has accomplished an unlikely feat with her second show, I May Destroy You - a sexy, cool, funny half-hour about, well, rape and consent in the digital era"". New York Times critic Mike Hale wrote: ""Coel... has an uncommon ability as a writer to blend the serious and the sardonic, in a way that doesn't wink at the audience. In I May Destroy You, she rarely strikes a false note.""TV fans on social media also heaped praise on the production.

Joel Schumacher: Director of The Lost Boys and two Batman films dies,"Hollywood director Joel Schumacher, whose films included St Elmo's Fire, The Lost Boys and Flatliners, has died at the age of 80.The filmmaker was behind a string of big budget films in the 1980s and 1990s, including The Client and A Time to Kill, as well as two Batman sequels.Star Trek writer and producer Bryan Fuller and director Kevin Smith were among the first to pay tribute.""He couldn't have been nicer or more hospitable,"" Smith tweeted.""I distinctly remember feeling hopeful when I learned he was gay and out and that there may be a place for me yet,"" wrote Fuller.Kiefer Sutherland, who starred in The Lost Boys, tweeted that Schumacher's ""joy, spirit and talent will live on"".Schumacher's publicists said he had been ill with cancer for more than a year.Variety wrote that the director ""brought his fashion background"" to directing and captured the feel of an era with his ""stylish films"".The New York native first entered the film industry as a costume designer in the 1970s, working alongside luminaries such as Woody Allen.He went on to write the 1976 low-budget comedy Car Wash, as well as the screenplay for a film adaptation of the Broadway musical The Wiz.But his big break came in 1985, with his third feature film St Elmo's Fire, which he co-wrote and directed.Alongside The Breakfast Club, which came out in the same year, it became one of the seminal films of the Brat Pack era and launched Demi Moore's film career.His follow-up, The Lost Boys - about a group of young vampires in small-town California - became a cult favourite, and his 1990 hit Flatliners saw him again team up with Kiefer Sutherland.Schumacher worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts and Michael Douglas. He directed Douglas in 1993's Falling Down, which was nominated for the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious Palme D'Or.He took over the reins of the Batman franchise from Tim Burton in 1995, casting Val Kilmer as the Caped Crusader and Jim Carrey as the Riddler. The film grossed more than $300m worldwide.However, his second outing - Batman and Robin - starring George Clooney in the lead and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze was critically panned and nearly finished off Clooney's burgeoning film career.Schumacher was noted for his ability to pick out new talent and he was fundamental in establishing the careers of A-list stars such as Sutherland, Rob Lowe and Colin Farrell. He directed Farrell in 2000's Tigerland, the actor's first leading role, and later in Phone Booth.Schumacher's style came to the fore in two memorable music videos, Seal's Kiss From a Rose and INXS's Devil Inside.His 2004 film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera, which received three Oscar nominations despite lukewarm reviews, was among the last of his films.Schumacher was reportedly the composer's first choice as director, with Lord Lloyd Webber having admired his work with music on The Lost Boys.Most recently, in 2013, he took the helm on a couple of episodes of the first season of Netflix series House of Cards, before more or less retiring from working life.He once said: ""If you love a movie, there are hundreds of people who made it lovable for you. If you don't like it, blame the director. That's what our name's there for.""",22 June 2020,entertainment
"The Luminaries: Warm reviews, but was it (literally) too dark?","BBC One drama The Luminaries has attracted criticism from some viewers and critics for its darkly lit scenes.The first episode of the series, based on Eleanor Catton's Booker-winning novel, was praised in several reviews after its broadcast on Sunday night.But The Telegraph and The Independent were among those commenting on the difficulties viewing certain scenes.The show's director has previously said the dim lighting is deliberate and adds a ""sense of mystery and intrigue"".The first episode of The Luminaries was watched by an average live audience of 5.3 million - the second highest launch for a BBC drama so far this year after The Salisbury Poisonings.The Luminaries is set on New Zealand's South Island at the height of the 1860s gold rush, and Catton has adapted the book for the small screen herself.""Here we go again with one of the BBC's dark dramas,"" wrote Anita Singh of The Daily Telegraph after the first episode aired. ""I don't mean tonally, although The Luminaries is a tale of murder and weirdness. I mean, literally, dark. ""Look, I know they didn't have brilliant lighting in 19th Century New Zealand but help us out here, we can't see a thing. And it's not as if the rest of The Luminaries is particularly illuminating.""The Independent's Ed Cumming awarded the show four stars, but noted: ""Most things are unclear. The scene is gloomier than Wolf Hall in a candle shortage. ""We can discern echoing voices, gunshots, a warm-lit cabin, a travelling politician, a wounded Maori, but not much else.""In an otherwise positive review, The Sun's Jill Robinson said:  ""The first episode of the new drama wasn't perfect, as the flash-forward scenes were so dark, it was hard to tell what was happening.""This took some of the impact away from some key scenes, and so, at times, The Luminaries needs to be a little more illuminating, otherwise they risk the wrath of viewers.""Many viewers on social media also pointed out the dim lighting, with some saying they had to turn up their brightness while watching.However, director Claire McCarthy said in a previous interview the series was deliberately shot in this way.""The colour palette is more gothic and grounded in the shadows. We wanted a sense of mystery and intrigue and a kind of burnished golden world inside the interiors,"" she explained.""We were very influenced by gold and not only did we have to research how gold could be filmed, and how it would appear on screen, but also just the way that we would light largely through flame, candlelight and natural light. ""We were trying to inhabit the kind of world and the resources that they would have at that time so we embraced that as a visual aesthetic. We wanted there to be a visceral quality to the show, rather than it to feel typically period or dusty, and so there needed to be an energy and a dynamism to the way the camera captured the world.""This isn't the first time a BBC drama has attracted criticism for its dimly-lit scenes.The corporation's 2015 production of Wolf Hall received a similar response - with many viewers and critics complaining about the darkness while praising the show overall.Some critics did not let dim lighting deter them from giving the show a positive review overall.""It is glorious escapism, perfect for our times,"" wrote Lucy Mangan in The Guardian., awarding the first episode four stars.""A cracking, challenging read has become a cracking, unchallenging series and both do their jobs perfectly. Joy.""Characters-with-a-capital-C everywhere, more plot than you know what to do with, hares set running at every turn, lavish period detail and lighting replicating the novel's gorgeous staginess, and a convoluted murder-mystery.""Writing in The Radio Times, Flora Carr said ""All in all, Catton's choice to spin The Luminaries on its axis, with a new focus on the female perspective, feels fresh and needed.""The sprawling novel was always going to be a nightmare to adapt, but by reintroducing us to the story via characters we barely met the first time around, Catton has managed to breathe new life into her tale.""Den of Geek's Louisa Mellor agreed, writing: ""Catton has melted down her extraordinary novel and recast it into a new form, one that, despite some absence of heart, works far, far better than was ever destined. ""As the screenwriter adapting her own work, Catton has given The Luminaries a drastic rewrite, re-centring the story around the fate-pummelled romance of two of the novel's little-seen characters. The mystery and mysticism and complex connections are all still here, but bedded into a more stable set of events.""But in her review for The Telegraph, Singh said: ""It sounds odd to say that a period drama feels dated. But the BBC has been doing such great work of late with modern-day dramas - Normal People, last week's Salisbury Poisonings, the extraordinary I May Destroy You - that The Luminaries seemed a stuffy throwback by comparison. ""It doesn't help that this sort of thing is best suited to autumn, when the nights are drawing in, but has been plonked in the middle of the summer schedule.""In his review for The Independent, Cummings said: ""The Luminaries is luminous, at least when it's visible... Greed has rarely looked so good.""But, he added, the series ""feels crammed in... perhaps no production could fit so much plot into so limited a form.""""There's one lesson from art that would be lost on prospectors: less can be more. In trying to tell such a complex story, The Luminaries risks swamping its viewers. There's gold in those all-black hills, but as in every bonanza, it's hard to tell how much.""The Luminaries, broke two records when it won the Booker Prize in 2013. At 27 years old, Eleanor Catton became the youngest ever winner, while the novel itself was the longest ever book to win, running at more than 800 pages. ",22 June 2020,entertainment

'It was precarious and still is': Bookshops on the battle with virus and Amazon,"Before lockdown, the number of independent bookshops in the UK rose for three years in a row. But the pandemic drove customers online - and shops had to get creative to survive.Running an independent bookshop can be a challenge at the best of times, trying to compete with the might of Amazon and the supermarkets. In recent years, things had been looking up, however, with 890 on our high streets in 2019, up from 867 three years earlier. They took a major hit during lockdown, but most have reopened (except in Scotland) in time for Independent Bookshop Week, which runs until Saturday.

Christian Li: The young Harry Potter fan on his music stardom,"Like many 12-year-old schoolboys, Christian Li likes Harry Potter, The Hobbit and Angry Birds. But what sets him apart is his gift for the violin. ""I feel most happy and confident when I'm playing the violin,"" he says. ""I can express my feelings.""And it has made him a classical music superstar.Born in Melbourne to Chinese parents, Christian first picked up a violin at the age of five.  It was by no means inevitable. ""My parents don't play musical instruments. They are not musical,"" he says.  ""My mum is an accountant and my dad is an engineer.""But within weeks he had been chosen to play the violin in a television advert in China for powdered milk. And by the age of 10, Christian had made history, becoming the youngest-ever winner of the Menuhin competition, the world's leading violin competition. ""I was actually quite surprised, I didn't expect to win such a prestigious competition,"" he says modestly.  ""I didn't think about winning, I just thought about playing."" The video of his performance, on a half-size violin, of Summer from Vivaldi's Four Seasons  has since attracted millions of views online.The self-possessed youngster does admit:  ""I get a little bit nervous just before I get onto stage but after I start playing I'm fine.""And he is helped by a ritual which makes him ""feel a bit calmer ... and gives me energy.""He reveals: ""I always eat a banana"" before curtain up.Now, at the age of 12, in another musical first, Christian has become the youngest artist signed by the Decca Classics record label. For his first single he recorded the fiendishly difficult and technically demanding La Ronde Des Lutins or Dance of the Goblins, by the Italian composer and violinist Antonio Bazzini. Christian says he had wanted to learn the piece since he first heard it a couple of years ago. ""I was really captivated. It was Maxim Vengerov, (one of the most celebrated contemporary violinists and Christian's hero), and I think I watched the whole piece without even actually blinking.""When it came to record it, Christian had to play it only twice."" I got it right the second time."" He gives himself nine out of 10 for his performance. ""I'm satisfied with it but there's always room for improvement,"" he insists.  And that is why Christian Li practises for four hours every day after school - and more at weekends. ""I just get used to it and I enjoy it and I feel a bit relieved after I've practised.""If it sounds like all work and no play, he is keen to stress he does have spare time. He likes reading fiction, enjoying the ""magical world"" of Harry Potter and says he hope to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter when he next comes to the UK. ""I like swimming, cycling and running"" he says and plays computer games ""a  little, but not a lot""  like Angry Birds, rather than ones which involve ""fighting and bloody games."" Although he makes an exception for ""the classics like Michael Jackson,"" he says ""I do not really like listening to pop music very much."" Instead he prefers listening to movie soundtracks ""like Batman, Superman and Star Wars"".""They are very dramatic and they have lots of power in that music and they're classical as well.""There is no doubt his workload is demanding. He has performed at festivals and venues all over the world including the Sydney Opera House and Carnegie Hall in New York. Christian dreams of being ""a professional concert violin soloist.  I love to be travelling and playing exciting music with orchestras ... that's what I like to do.""But his burgeoning career has been interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.  He had, for example, been due to perform with the British cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason at the Australian Festival of Chamber Music in August.  ""All of my overseas trips and concert performances were now actually cancelled which is a little sad of course,"" he says. But Christian Li doesn't seem like a boy who is downcast for long. ""Actually on the bright side I practise more technical things than before, like scales, etudes and caprices and I can build up my repertoire to have more pieces to play.""But even this musical prodigy concedes:  ""I miss having an audience.""

'It was precarious and still is': Bookshops on the battle with virus and Amazon,"Before lockdown, the number of independent bookshops in the UK rose for three years in a row. But the pandemic drove customers online - and shops had to get creative to survive.Running an independent bookshop can be a challenge at the best of times, trying to compete with the might of Amazon and the supermarkets. In recent years, things had been looking up, however, with 890 on our high streets in 2019, up from 867 three years earlier. They took a major hit during lockdown, but most have reopened (except in Scotland) in time for Independent Bookshop Week, which runs until Saturday. Many found new ways to reach readers while their doors were shut, but their long-term futures are still in the balance.""As yet we have no idea how many retail casualties may result from the crisis,"" said Meryl Halls, head of the Booksellers Association.Bookbugs and Dragon Tales in Norwich had only been open for seven months when it was forced to shut again.

Joel Schumacher: Director of The Lost Boys and two Batman films dies,"Hollywood director Joel Schumacher, whose films included St Elmo's Fire, The Lost Boys and Flatliners, has died at the age of 80.The filmmaker was behind a string of big budget films in the 1980s and 1990s, including The Client and A Time to Kill, as well as two Batman sequels.Star Trek writer and producer Bryan Fuller and director Kevin Smith were among the first to pay tribute.""He couldn't have been nicer or more hospitable,"" Smith tweeted.""I distinctly remember feeling hopeful when I learned he was gay and out and that there may be a place for me yet,"" wrote Fuller.Kiefer Sutherland, who starred in The Lost Boys, tweeted that Schumacher's ""joy, spirit and talent will live on"".Schumacher's publicists said he had been ill with cancer for more than a year.Variety wrote that the director ""brought his fashion background"" to directing and captured the feel of an era with his ""stylish films"".The New York native first entered the film industry as a costume designer in the 1970s, working alongside luminaries such as Woody Allen.He went on to write the 1976 low-budget comedy Car Wash, as well as the screenplay for a film adaptation of the Broadway musical The Wiz.But his big break came in 1985, with his third feature film St Elmo's Fire, which he co-wrote and directed.Alongside The Breakfast Club, which came out in the same year, it became one of the seminal films of the Brat Pack era and launched Demi Moore's film career.His follow-up, The Lost Boys - about a group of young vampires in small-town California - became a cult favourite, and his 1990 hit Flatliners saw him again team up with Kiefer Sutherland.Schumacher worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts and Michael Douglas. He directed Douglas in 1993's Falling Down, which was nominated for the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious Palme D'Or.He took over the reins of the Batman franchise from Tim Burton in 1995, casting Val Kilmer as the Caped Crusader and Jim Carrey as the Riddler. The film grossed more than $300m worldwide.However, his second outing - Batman and Robin - starring George Clooney in the lead and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze was critically panned and nearly finished off Clooney's burgeoning film career.Schumacher was noted for his ability to pick out new talent and he was fundamental in establishing the careers of A-list stars such as Sutherland, Rob Lowe and Colin Farrell. He directed Farrell in 2000's Tigerland, the actor's first leading role, and later in Phone Booth.Schumacher's style came to the fore in two memorable music videos, Seal's Kiss From a Rose and INXS's Devil Inside.His 2004 film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera, which received three Oscar nominations despite lukewarm reviews, was among the last of his films.Schumacher was reportedly the composer's first choice as director, with Lord Lloyd Webber having admired his work with music on The Lost Boys.Most recently, in 2013, he took the helm on a couple of episodes of the first season of Netflix series House of Cards, before more or less retiring from working life.He once said: ""If you love a movie, there are hundreds of people who made it lovable for you. If you don't like it, blame the director. That's what our name's there for.""",22 June 2020,entertainment
BBC commits £100m to increasing diversity on TV,"The BBC is to increase diversity by investing £100m of its TV budget over a three year period to produce ""diverse and inclusive content"".Director general Tony Hall has described the move, which will apply from April 2021, as ""a big leap"".The BBC has set itself a mandatory target - 20% of off-screen talent must come from under-represented groups.That includes those with a disability or from a BAME or disadvantaged socio-economic background.There will also be three ""tests"" for diversity in the BBC's TV output, with programmes needing to meet two of them to qualify - diverse stories and portrayal on-screen, diverse production teams and talent and diverse-led production companies.The announcement follows widespread Black Lives Matter protests, after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in the US.""The senseless killing of George Floyd - and what it tells us about the stain of systemic racism - has had a profound impact on all of us,"" said Lord Hall.""It's made us question ourselves about what more we can do to help tackle racism - and drive inclusion within our organisation and in society as a whole.""This is our response - it's going to drive change in what we make and who makes it.  It's a big leap forward - and we'll have more to announce in the coming weeks.""Recent BBC productions from ethnic minority creatives and featuring actors from BAME backgrounds include Michaela Coel's 12-part drama, I May Destroy You. It charts the fallout from a sexual assault and received rave reviews.Elsewhere, the story of Anthony Bryan and the Windrush scandal was brought to our screens in the feature-length drama, Sitting In Limbo.In fact, the diversity announcement arrives on the 72nd anniversary of the day the Empire Windrush arrived at the port of Tilbury symbolising the beginning of the migration of thousands of people from the Caribbean to the UK.In October last year, TV presenter and campaigner June Sarpong was appointed as the BBC's director of creative diversity, as it pledged to ensure 50% of on-air roles will go to women by 2020, with targets of 15% for black, Asian and minority ethnic groups [BAME], 8% for disabled people and 8% for LGBT staff.Off air, the BBC promised at the time to increase the proportion of leadership roles filled by women from 44% to 50% by next year, and raise the share of such senior roles held by BAME staff from 11.5% to 15%.Reacting to Monday's latest package, Sarpong said: ""I came to the BBC as an outsider. Before joining I had an idea of this being an organisation that did not want to change. What I found was something different: an organisation that had ambitious goals for diversity and inclusion but didn't know how to reach them.""She believes the commitment ""will help to drive real change that will be felt by all audiences"".""I'm pleased that we're announcing this fund as the first of a series of bold steps that will help make the BBC an instrument of real change.""""As a black woman,"" she added, ""I feel and share in the pain that so many are feeling worldwide.""It makes it all the more important that we show up now not just with words but with meaningful action.""The cash injection will support diversity and inclusion across all genres of TV, including Children's, Education and Current Affairs.The BBC is calling it ""the biggest financial investment to on-air inclusion in the industry"", declaring that ""the media industry is not changing fast enough"".""The measures announced today are designed to accelerate the pace of change in increasing diversity and inclusion both on and off air,"" the statement read.Speaking to The Observer on Sunday, director Steve McQueen led the attack on racism in the British film and TV industry and the lack of diversity.""It's just not healthy,"" said Sir Steve. ""It's wrong. And yet, many people in the industry go along with it as if it is normal. It's not normal. It is anything but normal. It's blindingly, obviously wrong. It's blatant racism. Fact. I grew up with it.""The BBC's director of content, Charlotte Moore, said McQueen challenged her and the organisation to ""set meaningful targets and take proper action"" last year during the making of his upcoming anthology series, Small Axe.""He was right,"" said Moore. ""Today's announcement represents a truly transformational commitment to both on and off screen representation.""Concrete, tangible action is the only way we can bring about real sustainable change.""Meanwhile, actors including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michaela Coel and Noel Clarke, as well as David Oyelowo and Meera Syal, have signed an open letter demanding that the UK film and TV industry will now ""put its money and practices where its mouth is"".The document, revealed on Monday, has more than 4,000 signatures, including those of presenter Anita Rani and directors Asif Kapadia, Gurinder Chadha and Rapman.",22 June 2020,entertainment
