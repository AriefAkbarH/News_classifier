How live entertainment is evolving online to be a lifeline in lockdown,"From gigs to plays and quizzes, live entertainment has moved online during coronavirus lockdown - and creative minds are coming up with new ideas to give us back some of the human connection we've lost.Every Saturday for the past two months, Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has sat down and written a song.Well, he has co-written a song - with 5,000 fans on Instagram.He asks them for chords, comes up with melodies, and puts them to a vote. He then asks for ideas for lyrics before coming back an hour later with a finished track. ""Some are really good,"" he says. End of Youtube post  by Snow PatrolLightbody also performs solo online gigs from home, but wanted to do something more collaborative too.""You can say absolutely anything in this. It's therapeutic and cathartic for me,"" he explains.""In a 'gig', I chat a little bit, but you can't really read the comments because you're playing songs. But with this, it feels like you're engaging with everybody.""The fans also vote for the set lists in his regular online concerts. ""I could just choose a bunch of songs that I want to play, which I did do one week and it just didn't really work,"" Lightbody says. ""It just felt a little disconnected.""I miss playing live, I do. But it's going to be a long time, so this is what we've got.""With the communal thrill of congregating in the same room currently out of the question, Lightbody is among the artists to have come up with interesting ways to bring people together.When his Saturday Songwrite sessions have generated 10 or 12 decent tracks, he'll release an album for charity - although he hasn't settled on a charity yet. ""It might be best to put that to a vote as well.""Few musicians haven't done online performances, which can have an intimate charm (but can also be quite dull, beyond the voyeuristic kick of having a nosey in their houses).Lightbody recommends fellow Northern Irish singer Roe, who could teach the bigger names a thing or two about audio and video quality.This was filmed in isolation with Jay Dickson on the drums.

Fans and musicians listen together in real time, tweeting their thoughts and memories.""There's power in listening and knowing others are doing so at the same as you,"" Burgess told The Sunday Times.In the US, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland - who staged a song-for-song producer clash in 2018 - now run a regular lockdown face-off, inviting different stars to go head-to-head in weekly Verzuz battles on Instagram.Erykah Badu and Jill Scott's recent battle was more of a love-in, and drew 700,000 live viewers.The New York Times has called Verzuz ""perhaps the most powerful quarantine-friendly entertainment franchise going"".Last night's #VERZUZ was special ‚ú® Thank you @fatbellybella and @missjillscott üôè@Timbaland @THEREALSWIZZZ pic.twitter.com/8iOLySRompEnd of Twitter post  by @verzuzonlineBeyond music, lockdown may turn out to be a tipping point for activities like quizzes, choirs, and exercise, yoga and cookery lessons, which have found new leases of life online (despite the inevitable loss of the human touch).In theatre, as in music, it's hard to replicate the live experience on screen. But some are using technology to create a new kind of show.Although monologues have been filmed in lockdown and pre-recorded shows have been put online, they often can't capture the excitement of being in an audience. Plus, the magical, fantastical storytelling of theatre doesn't translate well to the screen.""What doesn't work is watching streaming of plays on computers,"" playwright Simon Stephens told BBC Radio 4's Front Row last week. ""Whenever I watch those I just feel lonelier than I felt before.""What is interesting is when writers, directors, actors and designers start thinking about - what are the dramatic potentials of Zoom?""In recent weeks, creative types have been exploring just that.David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman and Denise Gough starred in A Separate Peace, a one-act play by Sir Tom Stoppard on Zoom.""I'm fascinated by the format, which is a completely new kind of way of putting on a play where paradoxically you stay home and live theatre comes to you,"" Sir Tom said.The show tried to replicate something of the live experience, with audience members buying a ticket in advance and turning up at an allotted time - the performance deliberately wasn't put online to watch afterwards.It had professional crew, including video, lighting, costume and sound designers, and the actors (all at home, obviously) entered and exited their quarters of the screen as they would a stage. ""The cast were saying they were so nervous, like 'I really felt like I was standing in the wings,'"" says producer Matt Humphrey.""We want to show other people that this can be done and give confidence to other people that live theatre still has a place during lockdown."" And he believes such Zoom-style shows will still have a place when quarantine lifts.The Guardian's five-star review declared: ""If, for however long, this is live theatre's future, then it works triumphantly.""Another Zoom theatre triumph got the audience fully involved from their sofas.In a playful version of The Tempest from Northern Ireland-based theatre company Big Telly and Oxford's Creation Theatre, viewers were asked to help out by doing things like making storm sound effects and pretending to be a flock of birds. The most enthusiastic were spotlighted on screen for the rest of the audience to see.Another show, Operation Elsewhere, was originally ""an immersive theatre game"" played in the real world.  When the world locked down, it was hastily reworked for Zoom - also with lots of audience participation.""People turn all the lights off and get under blankets because we need cover of darkness,"" Big Telly artistic director Zoe Seaton explains.

""We're interested in taking that further.""We work in rural communities in Ireland mostly, as well as Belfast and Derry, and suddenly our audience are in Brooklyn, and you think, oh gosh!""The key has been inviting the audience to bring the shows to life, Seaton adds.

From theatre director to crisis co-ordinator... and game show host,"When you're suddenly tasked with co-ordinating emergency food parcel deliveries to vulnerable local people during a pandemic, the ability to think creatively comes in useful.As artistic director of one of the UK's most innovative theatre companies, Alan Lane is used to coming up with imaginative solutions.But they normally involve finding ways to stage epic community theatre shows, not making sure hundreds of people have the food and medicines they need in a lockdown.""Today we find ourselves with a Transit van full of crisps,"" he says on the phone from Leeds. ""Which is amazing.""But yesterday we didn't have any vegetables. And tomorrow we're not going to have any eggs.""So constantly I'm on the phone doing deals. The other day, I swapped a load of tote bags that I got from the university for some face masks, which I split in half and swapped the other half for a lot of cream.""It's constant creative thinking, constant problem solving.""Six weeks ago, Lane and his company Slung Low were asked by Leeds City Council to co-ordinate the community response in Holbeck and Beeston, meaning any requests for help from the 10,000 households in the area have been passed to them.They are mainly from people needing food, but prescriptions need dropping off too, and they are often asked to just phone lonely people for a chat.Lane is in charge of around 90 volunteers, including some from the region's other arts organisations - from Opera North and Yorkshire Sculpture Park to theatre company Red Ladder. Bafta-winning TV writer and producer Mark Catley is driving a van two days a week.Managing them is not the only new role Lane has taken on during the pandemic. When not scrounging and delivering food, he has become a game show host, and a very entertaining one at that - appearing online every fortnight from Slung Low's HQ to keep locals' spirits up.He says that makes Slung Low the only people in the UK to be putting on regular live performances from a theatre stage during the lockdown.On top of that, he has launched an open-air art gallery, posting residents' lockdown pictures on lampposts. And Slung Low has just made a short film - shot before coronavirus rewrote Lane's job description - which went online on Friday.""We didn't know this at the time, but having a short film to release at the moment is much better than having a play,"" he says.Except - he will be taking an enforced break from all that frenetic activity for a while. When we spoke on Tuesday, he had just been for a Covid-19 test. It came back negative, but he has symptoms so is isolating and recovering. Others have stepped in to ensure Slung Low's work goes on.In truth, it has never been a conventional theatre company.It made its name by staging big outdoor plays using professional actors and local volunteers, but in 2018 opened a cultural community college on a double decker bus, and in 2019 took over the UK's oldest working men's club.It still runs the Holbeck as a working men's club - or did before the lockdown. In normal times, the function room hosts gatherings ranging from majorette award ceremonies to African funeral wakes as well as Slung Low's experimental theatre and cabarets.""Everybody turns up to the cabaret,"" Lane says. ""It's proper old-fashioned fun, and we serve dinner in the middle, and they normally go on for too long, and the band plays out, and everyone staggers out drunk.""When lockdown put paid to that, he decided to do an online version and came up with You Can Bet!, a game show that sees him don a tuxedo and bow tie to do silly challenges.Viewers can phone in and gamble on whether he can jump over an ironing board without touching it, or beat his four-year-old son in an obstacle course while dressed as a dinosaur.In fact, young David is the real star of the show. And yes, it is just a bit inspired by 1980s and 90s game show You Bet! - whose former host Matthew Kelly sent a tongue-in-cheek message for their first episode.""The vast majority of our members are absolutely right in the middle of that crisis group that you really don't want leaving the house,"" Lane says.""But it's been a long month for them now. So for half an hour a week, they get to tune in and roll their eyes at how silly we are.""You Can Bet! is very different from the short film Slung Low has just put online, The Good Book, which is set in Leeds at the start of a future civil war. It features dozens of locals alongside professional actors like Fleabag's Angus Imrie, and is the first work from Slung Low offshoot Leeds People's Theatre.""We realised that in order to be in a Slung Low [theatre] show, you have to give up three evenings and every weekend for three months. And that means that only certain types of people can be in those shows,"" Lane says.""Whereas being in a film, some people only gave up one weekend, and they still got to have a really rich experience.""The connection with the local community is what sets Slung Low apart from other theatre companies and means it can adapt to doing things like delivering food during a crisis, Lane says.Other venues have been busy putting their shows online and continuing their education and outreach activities digitally, but Lane thinks they could be doing more with their facilities.""There are a lot of vans currently sat in the car parks of arts organisations because they couldn't quite work out the insurance to get them doing food bank work,"" he says.He adds: ""We spend a lot of time talking about what we're for at Slung Low. What we're for is not putting on a show for people to pay for tickets.""It's something we do quite a bit, and something that we can be quite good at on a good day. But it's not what we're for.

Eurovision: Abba's Waterloo voted best song of all time,"Abba's Waterloo has been named the greatest Eurovision song of all time by BBC viewers.Eurovision: Come Together saw the public vote for their favourites, on the night that this year's song contest was due to take place.The 2020 competition was cancelled in March amid the coronavirus pandemic.The Swedish foursome won it in 1974 in Brighton. The track, which topped the UK charts and set them on their way to fame, went on to sell nearly 6m copies.Speaking later on the night, Bjorn Ulvaeus from the band said he found it ""hard to believe"" that was where it began for them all those years ago.The shortlist for the programme included Eurovision classics from the likes of Netta, Bucks Fizz, Conchita Wurst and Gina G.But it was Agnetha, Anni-Frid, Benny and Bjorn who ultimately triumphed, with their musical metaphor about the joys of surrendering to love.End of Youtube post  by AbbaVEVOThe 19-strong song list was compiled by Eurovision experts and broadcasters, including Rylan Clark-Neal, Scott Mills, Ken Bruce, Adele Roberts and Mel Giedroyc, as well as former UK acts SuRie and Nicki French.Presenter Graham Norton upheld the tradition of raising a glass to the late Sir Terry Wogan, who hosted the contest for nearly 30 years.""We couldn't deny you your Eurovision fix,"" he declared.The programme also showcased what would have been the UK entry this year - James Newman's My Last Breath - and Norton spoke to the singer via video link.Newman said he was ""pretty gutted"" and ""had to have a few minutes to myself"" when he found out the contest had been cancelled.He said the staging had already been planned and showed an image of an underwater scene leading down from some steps.Newman added that his favourite Eurovision entry this year was Iceland's - it was one of the favourites to win had the competition gone ahead, according to recent Spotify streaming figures.Later on on Saturday evening, the BBC also joined with other European broadcasters for Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light, to honour all 41 songs which would have competed this year. Some of this year's songs would have been eliminated at the semi-finals, where the entrants are normally whittled down to 26 but the semis were also cancelled.The event was hosted from the Dutch city of Hilversum - an hour away from where the contest was due to take place in Rotterdam - while Norton popped up again as the UK's commentator, and acts appeared in various forms from across the continent.Eight highlights from Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light1.

The Night Watch: Will Gompertz reviews the Rijksmuseum's high tech photo ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ,"At 9am on Tuesday the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam posted an image of Rembrandt's The Night Watch (1642) on its website. Nothing particularly unusual about that, you might think. After all, the museum frequently uploads pictures of its masterpieces from Dutch Golden Age. But there was something about this particular photo that made it stand out just like the little girl in a gold dress in Rembrandt's famous group portrait of local civic guardsmen. The web image presents the painting unframed on a dark grey background. It looks sharp and well-lit but not exceptional in terms of photography. Until, that is, you click on it, at which point you're zoomed in a bit closer. Click again and you're propelled towards the outstretched hand of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq. Another click, and you're face-to-face with the leader of this group of not-so-merry-men. Once more, and you can see the glint in his eye and the texture of his ginger beard. At no point does the image start to pixelate or distort, it's pin-sharp throughout. And it remains so as you continue to click, getting further and further into the painting until the Captain's paint-cracked eyeball is the size of a fist, and you realise that tiny glint you first saw isn't the result of one dab of Rembrandt's brush, but four separate applications, each loaded with a slightly different shade of paint. And then you stop and think: Crikey, Rembrandt actually used four different colours to paint a minuscule light effect in the eye of one of the many life-sized protagonists featured in this group portrait, which probably wouldn't be seen by anybody anyway. Or, maybe, this visionary 17th Century Dutchman foresaw a future where the early experiments with camera obscura techniques, in which he might have dabbled, would eventually lead to a photographic technology capable of recording a visual representation of his giant canvas to a level of detail beyond the eyesight of even the artist himself! It is, quite frankly, amazing.  For instance, I've always liked the ghostly dog that turns and snarls at the drummer situated at the edge of the painting. I'd assumed the hound was unfinished and therefore unloved by Rembrandt, but now I can see by zooming in that the artist not only gave the dog a stylish collar, but also added a gold pendant with a tiny flash of red paint to echo the colour of the trousers worn by the drummer. Clearly, Rembrandt was pro-dogs.As always there is artifice behind the art, as you will see within moments of zooming into The Night Watch. It quickly becomes apparent that Rembrandt first created his wonderfully dynamic composition, and then fine-tuned it as he went along. You will spot lots of small shadowy corrections (pentimenti) he made, such as the top of the drummer's stick on the far right, or on the index finger of the Ensign holding the Troop's flag aloft. There is artifice in the photograph, too. It is not a single image as it appears, but a composite of 528 individual digital photographs that have been seamlessly stitched together to give us a completely new view of one the most famous paintings in western art.Let's zoom out for a moment. Rembrandt signed, dated and called his painting:  Officers and Men of the Amsterdam Kloveniers Militia, the Company of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq.It was a commissioned portrait by the Kloveniers Militia (a sort of Dad's Army of locals) to hang in their HQ. Those featured (probably 18 members originally) each paid to be included. Capt Cocq takes centre stage, with his trusty Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch to his side. The men gathered behind them are carrying an assortment of weapons with which to defend their neighbourhood. Muskets (Klover) were their speciality, a point Rembrandt illustrates with a surreal sequence running left to right across the picture featuring three musketeers. The first, dressed in red with white collar and cuffs, is loading his musket with gunpowder. The second, a young boy, partially obscured by Cocq's right arm, fires his gun, ruffling the feathers of Ruytenburch's hat but not the man himself, who one has to assume is stone deaf. And then, there's the third, an older man also dressed in red, blowing away the spent powder from the fired gun. The young girl in the gold dress is not a member of the militia, but is there as their shining symbolic mascot. The upturned feet of the dead chicken hanging from her belt represent the Kloveniers' golden claw emblem. The painting initially hung with several other huge group portraits, giving visitors to the troops' inner sanctum the sense of being surrounded by local muscle. It was subsequently moved in 1715 to the Town Hall on the Dam (now the Royal Palace), where it was trimmed on all four sides to fit between the doors. It was first called The Night Watch in 1897, when the varnish applied to protect the paint had become so old and stained the picture looked like a nocturnal scene. That layer of varnish was removed long ago in one of the 25 or more restorations and treatments The Night Watch has undergone over the years. The most memorable being in 1975 after a visitor to the museum attacked the painting with a knife, causing severe damage, traces of which you can see when you zoom in on the new composite photograph: An act of art historical sleuthing which is the digital photo's primary purpose. The 44.8 Gigapixel image was created for the Rijksmuseum's conservation department, which is currently embarked upon the most exhaustive facelift The Night Watch has probably ever endured.  It enables the team of 12 to look right into the picture without using microscopes, in order to see what work needs to be done. A huge amount is the answer. Zoom in and you'll detect plenty of cracked paint, which is to be expected. But zero in on the Captain's and Lieutenant's faces and you will notice they're covered in blackheads. That's not because they didn't know one end of a bath from the other - they were sophisticated chaps - it is probably down to aging white paint particles, the tops of which have broken off to reveal a dark inner. There are thousands of these pinprick blemishes, all of which conservators should be able to reverse, bringing an even greater liveliness to an already lively painting. The Night Watch is an incredible work of art. Soon, you will be able to stand in front of it once again when the Rijksmuseum re-opens on the 1 June (caveat: there will be vastly reduced number of admissions, and The Night Watch is currently encased in a glass box - still visible but not as approachable).  And if and when you do see it for real, you will immediately notice Rembrandt's exaggerated use of light and shade to create a sense of drama, aided and abetted by an all-action composition emphasised by teaming diagonal lines. The Night Watch is as close to theatre as a painting can get. As the director of the Rijksmuseum said, it is a school photo taken before everybody is lined up in order (it shows Capt. Cocq instructing Lt. Ruytenburch to bring his men to attention). It captures a moment of movement and mayhem.You can see that when in front of the canvas. But what you are not, when you're at home, you can now see the same sense of chaos in the way Rembrandt painted his masterpiece, made when he was at the peak of his fame, just at the time his beloved wife was dying and his life took a turn for the worse. The further you look into it the greater the mess appears to be. Splodges of impasto paint here, unfinished transitions there. It's a mixture of early Rembrandt tautness and late Rembrandt looseness. If you thought Van Gogh or Jackson Pollock invented expressionistic painting, you'll think again when you've zoomed into The Night Watch. It is a sight to behold. A magnificent sight, which extends our knowledge of a truly great work of art, whether you're an old timer or a first timer. New technology is often used to try to jazz up old art, which is generally a bad idea. But, the Rijksmuseum is using technology to increase our understanding and appreciation of a Golden Age great, and that is a good idea. As you can see.

Astrid Kirchherr: Beatles photographer dies aged 81,"Astrid Kirchherr, the German photographer whose early shots of The Beatles helped turn them into icons, has died aged 81.She took the first photo of the band in Hamburg in 1960, and is credited with helping develop their visual style.Her death was announced by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, who said she died in the city on Wednesday following a short illness.""Her gift to the Beatles was immeasurable,"" he wrote on Twitter.Kirchherr first came across the band when she visited a nightclub in her native Hamburg where they were playing. ""It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing,"" she later told Beatles biographer Bob Spitz. ""My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them.""She began dating Stuart Sutcliffe, the original bassist in the band, and even cut his hair into the famous mop top style that the group came to be associated with.The couple were engaged shortly after, but Sutcliffe died of a brain haemorrhage in 1962 aged just 21.""He was, and still is, the love of my life,"" Kirchherr told NPR in 2010.Kirchherr, who married twice but had no children, remained friends with the band after Sutcliffe's death and photographed them throughout the 1960s.In 2010, a selection of her images went on display in Liverpool. They were also released in a book entitled Astrid Kirchherr, A Retrospective.The previously unseen photographs included shots of The Beatles on holiday in Tenerife as well as some from the making of their film A Hard Day's Night in 1964.In her later years, Kirchherr worked as a stylist and interior designer, and also opened a photography shop in Hamburg.",15 May 2020,entertainment
Pretty Things frontman Phil May dies aged 75,"Phil May, the frontman of The Pretty Things, has died aged 75 after suffering complications from emergency hip surgery.A representative of the rock 'n' roll band confirmed he died on Friday morning at a Kings Lynn hospital.May had fallen off his bicycle earlier in the week.""Very sad news, he was a very talented guy and he will be sorely missed. I'm shocked,"" tweeted Kinks guitarist Dave Davies. The Pretty Things' 1968 album S.F Sorrow, based on a short story by May about the life of protagonist Sebastian F. Sorrow, is credited as one of the first real rock operas and concept albums.They were cited as an influence by a wide range of artists from David Bowie to Jimi Hendrix to Kasabian.Originally from Dartford, Kent, May formed the band in 1963 with guitarist Dick Taylor, a former bass player with an early incarnation of The Rolling Stones, and both bands were an integral part of the London blues-rock explosion.As his music developed in a more progressive psych-rock direction in the late 60s, singer and lyricist May became a leading countercultural figure, known for his long hair, drug-taking and bisexuality.""By the time The Pretty Things hit the TV screens, I was used to being abused and spat at and getting into punch-ups, because it had happened when we were art students,"" he recalled to The Guardian in 2018.""We'd done our apprenticeship at being outsiders.""In 1969, the band appeared in What's Good for the Goose, a bizarre sex comedy film, starring Norman Wisdom.Blur guitarist Graham Coxon paid tribute to May on Friday afternoon, directing his Twitter followers to the The Pretty Things' 1970 track Cries From The Midnight Circus.Singer Edwyn Collins pointed to their aforementioned seminal album, which he described as ""so great"".DJ Gary Crowley also said he was ""blasting Rosalyn across the flat in memory"" of May.He had been in poor health when The Pretty Things played a ""Final Bow"" farewell concert in December 2018, where they were joined on-stage by the likes of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and Sir Van Morrison.Their last album, Sweet Pretty Things (Are in Bed Now, of Course...) arrived in 2015.May is survived by his son, Paris May, his daughter, Sorrel May, and his partner, Colin Graham.",15 May 2020,entertainment
How live entertainment is evolving online to be a lifeline in lockdown,"From gigs to plays and quizzes, live entertainment has moved online during coronavirus lockdown - and creative minds are coming up with new ideas to give us back some of the human connection we've lost.Every Saturday for the past two months, Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has sat down and written a song.Well, he has co-written a song - with 5,000 fans on Instagram.He asks them for chords, comes up with melodies, and puts them to a vote. He then asks for ideas for lyrics before coming back an hour later with a finished track. ""Some are really good,"" he says. End of Youtube post  by Snow PatrolLightbody also performs solo online gigs from home, but wanted to do something more collaborative too.""You can say absolutely anything in this. It's therapeutic and cathartic for me,"" he explains.""In a 'gig', I chat a little bit, but you can't really read the comments because you're playing songs. But with this, it feels like you're engaging with everybody.""The fans also vote for the set lists in his regular online concerts. ""I could just choose a bunch of songs that I want to play, which I did do one week and it just didn't really work,"" Lightbody says. ""It just felt a little disconnected.""I miss playing live, I do. But it's going to be a long time, so this is what we've got.""With the communal thrill of congregating in the same room currently out of the question, Lightbody is among the artists to have come up with interesting ways to bring people together.When his Saturday Songwrite sessions have generated 10 or 12 decent tracks, he'll release an album for charity - although he hasn't settled on a charity yet. ""It might be best to put that to a vote as well.""Few musicians haven't done online performances, which can have an intimate charm (but can also be quite dull, beyond the voyeuristic kick of having a nosey in their houses).Lightbody recommends fellow Northern Irish singer Roe, who could teach the bigger names a thing or two about audio and video quality.This was filmed in isolation with Jay Dickson on the drums. We thought this would be a cool thing to do right now seeing...End of Facebook post  by ROESome performers get their fans involved - whether by taking requests or doing Q&As, virtual charity festivals or tutorials like Duran Duran star John Taylor with his bass masterclasses and Oti Mabuse with her dance lessons.Listening parties have also been a big hit. Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess has carved out a sideline as host of #timstwitterlisteningparty. Fans and musicians listen together in real time, tweeting their thoughts and memories.""There's power in listening and knowing others are doing so at the same as you,"" Burgess told The Sunday Times.In the US, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland - who staged a song-for-song producer clash in 2018 - now run a regular lockdown face-off, inviting different stars to go head-to-head in weekly Verzuz battles on Instagram.Erykah Badu and Jill Scott's recent battle was more of a love-in, and drew 700,000 live viewers.The New York Times has called Verzuz ""perhaps the most powerful quarantine-friendly entertainment franchise going"".Last night's #VERZUZ was special ‚ú® Thank you @fatbellybella and @missjillscott üôè@Timbaland @THEREALSWIZZZ pic.twitter.com/8iOLySRompEnd of Twitter post  by @verzuzonlineBeyond music, lockdown may turn out to be a tipping point for activities like quizzes, choirs, and exercise, yoga and cookery lessons, which have found new leases of life online (despite the inevitable loss of the human touch).In theatre, as in music, it's hard to replicate the live experience on screen. But some are using technology to create a new kind of show.Although monologues have been filmed in lockdown and pre-recorded shows have been put online, they often can't capture the excitement of being in an audience. Plus, the magical, fantastical storytelling of theatre doesn't translate well to the screen.""What doesn't work is watching streaming of plays on computers,"" playwright Simon Stephens told BBC Radio 4's Front Row last week. ""Whenever I watch those I just feel lonelier than I felt before.""What is interesting is when writers, directors, actors and designers start thinking about - what are the dramatic potentials of Zoom?""In recent weeks, creative types have been exploring just that.David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman and Denise Gough starred in A Separate Peace, a one-act play by Sir Tom Stoppard on Zoom.""I'm fascinated by the format, which is a completely new kind of way of putting on a play where paradoxically you stay home and live theatre comes to you,"" Sir Tom said.The show tried to replicate something of the live experience, with audience members buying a ticket in advance and turning up at an allotted time - the performance deliberately wasn't put online to watch afterwards.It had professional crew, including video, lighting, costume and sound designers, and the actors (all at home, obviously) entered and exited their quarters of the screen as they would a stage. ""The cast were saying they were so nervous, like 'I really felt like I was standing in the wings,'"" says producer Matt Humphrey.""We want to show other people that this can be done and give confidence to other people that live theatre still has a place during lockdown."" And he believes such Zoom-style shows will still have a place when quarantine lifts.The Guardian's five-star review declared: ""If, for however long, this is live theatre's future, then it works triumphantly.""Another Zoom theatre triumph got the audience fully involved from their sofas.In a playful version of The Tempest from Northern Ireland-based theatre company Big Telly and Oxford's Creation Theatre, viewers were asked to help out by doing things like making storm sound effects and pretending to be a flock of birds. The most enthusiastic were spotlighted on screen for the rest of the audience to see.Another show, Operation Elsewhere, was originally ""an immersive theatre game"" played in the real world.  When the world locked down, it was hastily reworked for Zoom - also with lots of audience participation.""People turn all the lights off and get under blankets because we need cover of darkness,"" Big Telly artistic director Zoe Seaton explains. ""There was one point where a character says, 'If you've got war paint get it on now', and you see people rushing to the kitchen and getting ketchup and things.""End of Youtube post  by Big TellyVirtual backgrounds and green screens can create settings and effects that would be difficult and expensive in real life. ""I'm really enjoying it because it feels like a new box of tricks, a new way of telling stories,"" Seaton says.People have been tuning in from around the world and using the shows to have a shared night ""out"" with separated family members.""The joy of seeing your nephew and niece in Canada doing something in the same show that you're part of has just been amazing,"" Seaton says. ""We're interested in taking that further.""We work in rural communities in Ireland mostly, as well as Belfast and Derry, and suddenly our audience are in Brooklyn, and you think, oh gosh!""The key has been inviting the audience to bring the shows to life, Seaton adds. ""They have had that sense of community that theatre has, where you're all on the same journey. ""That's their main success. I think that's what people are missing in lockdown - that sense of community.""",18 May 2020,entertainment

""It's proper old-fashioned fun, and we serve dinner in the middle, and they normally go on for too long, and the band plays out, and everyone staggers out drunk.""When lockdown put paid to that, he decided to do an online version and came up with You Can Bet!, a game show that sees him don a tuxedo and bow tie to do silly challenges.Viewers can phone in and gamble on whether he can jump over an ironing board without touching it, or beat his four-year-old son in an obstacle course while dressed as a dinosaur.In fact, young David is the real star of the show.

And that means that only certain types of people can be in those shows,"" Lane says.""Whereas being in a film, some people only gave up one weekend, and they still got to have a really rich experience.""The connection with the local community is what sets Slung Low apart from other theatre companies and means it can adapt to doing things like delivering food during a crisis, Lane says.Other venues have been busy putting their shows online and continuing their education and outreach activities digitally, but Lane thinks they could be doing more with their facilities.""There are a lot of vans currently sat in the car parks of arts organisations because they couldn't quite work out the insurance to get them doing food bank work,"" he says.He adds: ""We spend a lot of time talking about what we're for at Slung Low. What we're for is not putting on a show for people to pay for tickets.""It's something we do quite a bit, and something that we can be quite good at on a good day. But it's not what we're for. And therefore, when you can't do that, it doesn't mean we stop.""",3 May 2020,entertainment

Some of this year's songs would have been eliminated at the semi-finals, where the entrants are normally whittled down to 26 but the semis were also cancelled.The event was hosted from the Dutch city of Hilversum - an hour away from where the contest was due to take place in Rotterdam - while Norton popped up again as the UK's commentator, and acts appeared in various forms from across the continent.Eight highlights from Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light1.

The Night Watch: Will Gompertz reviews the Rijksmuseum's high tech photo ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ,"At 9am on Tuesday the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam posted an image of Rembrandt's The Night Watch (1642) on its website. Nothing particularly unusual about that, you might think. After all, the museum frequently uploads pictures of its masterpieces from Dutch Golden Age. But there was something about this particular photo that made it stand out just like the little girl in a gold dress in Rembrandt's famous group portrait of local civic guardsmen. The web image presents the painting unframed on a dark grey background. It looks sharp and well-lit but not exceptional in terms of photography. Until, that is, you click on it, at which point you're zoomed in a bit closer. Click again and you're propelled towards the outstretched hand of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq. Another click, and you're face-to-face with the leader of this group of not-so-merry-men. Once more, and you can see the glint in his eye and the texture of his ginger beard. At no point does the image start to pixelate or distort, it's pin-sharp throughout. And it remains so as you continue to click, getting further and further into the painting until the Captain's paint-cracked eyeball is the size of a fist, and you realise that tiny glint you first saw isn't the result of one dab of Rembrandt's brush, but four separate applications, each loaded with a slightly different shade of paint. And then you stop and think: Crikey, Rembrandt actually used four different colours to paint a minuscule light effect in the eye of one of the many life-sized protagonists featured in this group portrait, which probably wouldn't be seen by anybody anyway. Or, maybe, this visionary 17th Century Dutchman foresaw a future where the early experiments with camera obscura techniques, in which he might have dabbled, would eventually lead to a photographic technology capable of recording a visual representation of his giant canvas to a level of detail beyond the eyesight of even the artist himself! It is, quite frankly, amazing.  For instance, I've always liked the ghostly dog that turns and snarls at the drummer situated at the edge of the painting. I'd assumed the hound was unfinished and therefore unloved by Rembrandt, but now I can see by zooming in that the artist not only gave the dog a stylish collar, but also added a gold pendant with a tiny flash of red paint to echo the colour of the trousers worn by the drummer. Clearly, Rembrandt was pro-dogs.As always there is artifice behind the art, as you will see within moments of zooming into The Night Watch. It quickly becomes apparent that Rembrandt first created his wonderfully dynamic composition, and then fine-tuned it as he went along. You will spot lots of small shadowy corrections (pentimenti) he made, such as the top of the drummer's stick on the far right, or on the index finger of the Ensign holding the Troop's flag aloft. There is artifice in the photograph, too. It is not a single image as it appears, but a composite of 528 individual digital photographs that have been seamlessly stitched together to give us a completely new view of one the most famous paintings in western art.Let's zoom out for a moment. Rembrandt signed, dated and called his painting:  Officers and Men of the Amsterdam Kloveniers Militia, the Company of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq.It was a commissioned portrait by the Kloveniers Militia (a sort of Dad's Army of locals) to hang in their HQ. Those featured (probably 18 members originally) each paid to be included. Capt Cocq takes centre stage, with his trusty Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch to his side. The men gathered behind them are carrying an assortment of weapons with which to defend their neighbourhood. Muskets (Klover) were their speciality, a point Rembrandt illustrates with a surreal sequence running left to right across the picture featuring three musketeers. The first, dressed in red with white collar and cuffs, is loading his musket with gunpowder. The second, a young boy, partially obscured by Cocq's right arm, fires his gun, ruffling the feathers of Ruytenburch's hat but not the man himself, who one has to assume is stone deaf. And then, there's the third, an older man also dressed in red, blowing away the spent powder from the fired gun. The young girl in the gold dress is not a member of the militia, but is there as their shining symbolic mascot. The upturned feet of the dead chicken hanging from her belt represent the Kloveniers' golden claw emblem. The painting initially hung with several other huge group portraits, giving visitors to the troops' inner sanctum the sense of being surrounded by local muscle. It was subsequently moved in 1715 to the Town Hall on the Dam (now the Royal Palace), where it was trimmed on all four sides to fit between the doors. It was first called The Night Watch in 1897, when the varnish applied to protect the paint had become so old and stained the picture looked like a nocturnal scene. That layer of varnish was removed long ago in one of the 25 or more restorations and treatments The Night Watch has undergone over the years. The most memorable being in 1975 after a visitor to the museum attacked the painting with a knife, causing severe damage, traces of which you can see when you zoom in on the new composite photograph: An act of art historical sleuthing which is the digital photo's primary purpose. The 44.8 Gigapixel image was created for the Rijksmuseum's conservation department, which is currently embarked upon the most exhaustive facelift The Night Watch has probably ever endured.  It enables the team of 12 to look right into the picture without using microscopes, in order to see what work needs to be done. A huge amount is the answer. Zoom in and you'll detect plenty of cracked paint, which is to be expected. But zero in on the Captain's and Lieutenant's faces and you will notice they're covered in blackheads. That's not because they didn't know one end of a bath from the other - they were sophisticated chaps - it is probably down to aging white paint particles, the tops of which have broken off to reveal a dark inner. There are thousands of these pinprick blemishes, all of which conservators should be able to reverse, bringing an even greater liveliness to an already lively painting. The Night Watch is an incredible work of art. Soon, you will be able to stand in front of it once again when the Rijksmuseum re-opens on the 1 June (caveat: there will be vastly reduced number of admissions, and The Night Watch is currently encased in a glass box - still visible but not as approachable).  And if and when you do see it for real, you will immediately notice Rembrandt's exaggerated use of light and shade to create a sense of drama, aided and abetted by an all-action composition emphasised by teaming diagonal lines. The Night Watch is as close to theatre as a painting can get. As the director of the Rijksmuseum said, it is a school photo taken before everybody is lined up in order (it shows Capt. Cocq instructing Lt. Ruytenburch to bring his men to attention). It captures a moment of movement and mayhem.You can see that when in front of the canvas. But what you are not, when you're at home, you can now see the same sense of chaos in the way Rembrandt painted his masterpiece, made when he was at the peak of his fame, just at the time his beloved wife was dying and his life took a turn for the worse. The further you look into it the greater the mess appears to be. Splodges of impasto paint here, unfinished transitions there. It's a mixture of early Rembrandt tautness and late Rembrandt looseness. If you thought Van Gogh or Jackson Pollock invented expressionistic painting, you'll think again when you've zoomed into The Night Watch. It is a sight to behold. A magnificent sight, which extends our knowledge of a truly great work of art, whether you're an old timer or a first timer. New technology is often used to try to jazz up old art, which is generally a bad idea. But, the Rijksmuseum is using technology to increase our understanding and appreciation of a Golden Age great, and that is a good idea. As you can see.

Astrid Kirchherr: Beatles photographer dies aged 81,"Astrid Kirchherr, the German photographer whose early shots of The Beatles helped turn them into icons, has died aged 81.She took the first photo of the band in Hamburg in 1960, and is credited with helping develop their visual style.Her death was announced by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, who said she died in the city on Wednesday following a short illness.""Her gift to the Beatles was immeasurable,"" he wrote on Twitter.Kirchherr first came across the band when she visited a nightclub in her native Hamburg where they were playing. ""It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing,"" she later told Beatles biographer Bob Spitz. ""My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them.""She began dating Stuart Sutcliffe, the original bassist in the band, and even cut his hair into the famous mop top style that the group came to be associated with.The couple were engaged shortly after, but Sutcliffe died of a brain haemorrhage in 1962 aged just 21.""He was, and still is, the love of my life,"" Kirchherr told NPR in 2010.Kirchherr, who married twice but had no children, remained friends with the band after Sutcliffe's death and photographed them throughout the 1960s.In 2010, a selection of her images went on display in Liverpool. They were also released in a book entitled Astrid Kirchherr, A Retrospective.The previously unseen photographs included shots of The Beatles on holiday in Tenerife as well as some from the making of their film A Hard Day's Night in 1964.In her later years, Kirchherr worked as a stylist and interior designer, and also opened a photography shop in Hamburg.",15 May 2020,entertainment
Pretty Things frontman Phil May dies aged 75,"Phil May, the frontman of The Pretty Things, has died aged 75 after suffering complications from emergency hip surgery.A representative of the rock 'n' roll band confirmed he died on Friday morning at a Kings Lynn hospital.May had fallen off his bicycle earlier in the week.""Very sad news, he was a very talented guy and he will be sorely missed. I'm shocked,"" tweeted Kinks guitarist Dave Davies. The Pretty Things' 1968 album S.F Sorrow, based on a short story by May about the life of protagonist Sebastian F. Sorrow, is credited as one of the first real rock operas and concept albums.They were cited as an influence by a wide range of artists from David Bowie to Jimi Hendrix to Kasabian.Originally from Dartford, Kent, May formed the band in 1963 with guitarist Dick Taylor, a former bass player with an early incarnation of The Rolling Stones, and both bands were an integral part of the London blues-rock explosion.As his music developed in a more progressive psych-rock direction in the late 60s, singer and lyricist May became a leading countercultural figure, known for his long hair, drug-taking and bisexuality.""By the time The Pretty Things hit the TV screens, I was used to being abused and spat at and getting into punch-ups, because it had happened when we were art students,"" he recalled to The Guardian in 2018.""We'd done our apprenticeship at being outsiders.""In 1969, the band appeared in What's Good for the Goose, a bizarre sex comedy film, starring Norman Wisdom.Blur guitarist Graham Coxon paid tribute to May on Friday afternoon, directing his Twitter followers to the The Pretty Things' 1970 track Cries From The Midnight Circus.Singer Edwyn Collins pointed to their aforementioned seminal album, which he described as ""so great"".DJ Gary Crowley also said he was ""blasting Rosalyn across the flat in memory"" of May.He had been in poor health when The Pretty Things played a ""Final Bow"" farewell concert in December 2018, where they were joined on-stage by the likes of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and Sir Van Morrison.Their last album, Sweet Pretty Things (Are in Bed Now, of Course...) arrived in 2015.May is survived by his son, Paris May, his daughter, Sorrel May, and his partner, Colin Graham.",15 May 2020,entertainment

The further you look into it the greater the mess appears to be. Splodges of impasto paint here, unfinished transitions there. It's a mixture of early Rembrandt tautness and late Rembrandt looseness. If you thought Van Gogh or Jackson Pollock invented expressionistic painting, you'll think again when you've zoomed into The Night Watch. It is a sight to behold. A magnificent sight, which extends our knowledge of a truly great work of art, whether you're an old timer or a first timer. New technology is often used to try to jazz up old art, which is generally a bad idea. But, the Rijksmuseum is using technology to increase our understanding and appreciation of a Golden Age great, and that is a good idea. As you can see.

Astrid Kirchherr: Beatles photographer dies aged 81,"Astrid Kirchherr, the German photographer whose early shots of The Beatles helped turn them into icons, has died aged 81.She took the first photo of the band in Hamburg in 1960, and is credited with helping develop their visual style.Her death was announced by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, who said she died in the city on Wednesday following a short illness.""Her gift to the Beatles was immeasurable,"" he wrote on Twitter.Kirchherr first came across the band when she visited a nightclub in her native Hamburg where they were playing. ""It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing,"" she later told Beatles biographer Bob Spitz. ""My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them.""She began dating Stuart Sutcliffe, the original bassist in the band, and even cut his hair into the famous mop top style that the group came to be associated with.The couple were engaged shortly after, but Sutcliffe died of a brain haemorrhage in 1962 aged just 21.""He was, and still is, the love of my life,"" Kirchherr told NPR in 2010.Kirchherr, who married twice but had no children, remained friends with the band after Sutcliffe's death and photographed them throughout the 1960s.In 2010, a selection of her images went on display in Liverpool. They were also released in a book entitled Astrid Kirchherr, A Retrospective.The previously unseen photographs included shots of The Beatles on holiday in Tenerife as well as some from the making of their film A Hard Day's Night in 1964.In her later years, Kirchherr worked as a stylist and interior designer, and also opened a photography shop in Hamburg.",15 May 2020,entertainment
Pretty Things frontman Phil May dies aged 75,"Phil May, the frontman of The Pretty Things, has died aged 75 after suffering complications from emergency hip surgery.A representative of the rock 'n' roll band confirmed he died on Friday morning at a Kings Lynn hospital.May had fallen off his bicycle earlier in the week.""Very sad news, he was a very talented guy and he will be sorely missed. I'm shocked,"" tweeted Kinks guitarist Dave Davies. The Pretty Things' 1968 album S.F Sorrow, based on a short story by May about the life of protagonist Sebastian F. Sorrow, is credited as one of the first real rock operas and concept albums.They were cited as an influence by a wide range of artists from David Bowie to Jimi Hendrix to Kasabian.Originally from Dartford, Kent, May formed the band in 1963 with guitarist Dick Taylor, a former bass player with an early incarnation of The Rolling Stones, and both bands were an integral part of the London blues-rock explosion.As his music developed in a more progressive psych-rock direction in the late 60s, singer and lyricist May became a leading countercultural figure, known for his long hair, drug-taking and bisexuality.""By the time The Pretty Things hit the TV screens, I was used to being abused and spat at and getting into punch-ups, because it had happened when we were art students,"" he recalled to The Guardian in 2018.""We'd done our apprenticeship at being outsiders.""In 1969, the band appeared in What's Good for the Goose, a bizarre sex comedy film, starring Norman Wisdom.Blur guitarist Graham Coxon paid tribute to May on Friday afternoon, directing his Twitter followers to the The Pretty Things' 1970 track Cries From The Midnight Circus.Singer Edwyn Collins pointed to their aforementioned seminal album, which he described as ""so great"".DJ Gary Crowley also said he was ""blasting Rosalyn across the flat in memory"" of May.He had been in poor health when The Pretty Things played a ""Final Bow"" farewell concert in December 2018, where they were joined on-stage by the likes of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and Sir Van Morrison.Their last album, Sweet Pretty Things (Are in Bed Now, of Course...) arrived in 2015.May is survived by his son, Paris May, his daughter, Sorrel May, and his partner, Colin Graham.",15 May 2020,entertainment
How some stars are helping music's unsung heroes in lockdown,"Whether they're guitar players, backing vocalists or studio engineers, career musicians struggle with pay even in regular times. Many take on extra work to make ends meet when their services aren't needed on stage or in the studio.For them, the Covid-19 pandemic has been a double whammy. Not only have tours and recording sessions been put on hold, but those second jobs in wedding bands or school classrooms have vanished, too.According to a Musicians Union survey, 92% of its members have seen their livelihood affected by coronavirus, losing an estimated ¬£13.9m in earnings in the first two weeks of the lockdown.Meanwhile, the Ivors Academy of songwriters and composers said it anticipated a loss of ¬£25,000 per member over a six-month period.The figures may come as a surprise, given recent headlines about record-breaking royalty payments and Rihanna's ¬£468m fortune, but the wealth in the music industry tends to accumulate at the top.For the rest, the ""industry has ground to a halt,"" says Olga FitzRoy, an award-winning engineer and producer whose credits include Coldplay, Foo Fighters and The Beatles.""I did my last session in the first week of March and I've had nothing since then, and my colleagues are pretty much in the same boat,"" she tells the BBC. ""There's no money coming in"".In the midst of the pandemic, however, some artists are finding ways to support their sidemen and women - and hoping they can establish new precedents along the way.In Paris, jazz artist Melody Gardot is making a new record from her apartment, and inviting musicians from around the world to form her ""virtual orchestra"".Anyone can sign up - and they'll receive musical charts, backing tracks and instructions with on how to record themselves performing at home.Crucially, however, she is paying standard union rates to anyone who appears on the finished record. ""The reality is I can't do what I do without those musicians,"" the Grammy nominee tells the BBC.""If I stand on stage by myself, it's way less interesting than if I have a beautiful array of colours to offer. So these people are equally important and we can't forget about them during this time."" I want to contribute something unique to this new movement of ‚Äòconnection despite distance‚Äô. During this complicated time, we miss essential connections with one other.  We miss hugs, we miss our family, our friends......in short we miss love. So I want to make a love project to help break the feeling of isolation between us. Join me in the first step of this new project ‚ÄúFrom Paris with Love‚Äù by submitting the following: 1. Film a 5 second ‚Äúvideo-portrait‚Äù, of yourself.  Film it HORIZONTALLY, and make sure we can see enough of you (chest to head) and with a fixed camera (it‚Äôs like taking a picture but 5 seconds long and in video format). Dont move too much :) Just pose and record with some natural light in front of a *NEUTRAL BACKGROUND* wearing *SOLID BLACK OR WHITE* tee shirt only please. 2. HANDWRITTEN horizontally, using a large black sharpie or black crayon on a white piece of paper (standard A4 format suggested) say ‚ÄúFrom (wherever you are) With Love‚Äù. Scan or photograph the paper (highest quality possible) and send ! 3. SEND both items (your photo scan and your video) to the email address : frompariswithloveproject@gmail.com **In your email please include your Instagram handle (if you have one) so we can find you later. After receiving these things, we‚Äôll put together a surprising collaborative video clip featuring all your submissions alongside a new piece of music called ‚ÄúFrom Paris with Love‚Äù. A large portion my royalties from this song will be donated to a Covid relief charity to help medical workers during this time. This way, we share as much love as we possibly can together. **Please remember if you send this along it means you‚Äôre okay for me to for use your image in this project, so think about breaking the ‚Äòquarantine pijama‚Äô uniform if you don‚Äôt want everybody to see you that way !

Feel free to pass this message along. This is just the first step of this collaborative journey so stay tuned..... ‚ù§Ô∏è With love, from Paris Frompariswithloveproject@gmail.comA post shared by  Melody Gardot (@melodygardotofficial) on Apr 29, 2020 at 8:31am PDTEnd of Instagram post  by melodygardotofficialSo far, Gardot has received submissions from players in ""Croatia, Santa Monica, France and England,"" ranging from top-level professionals to ""an 11-year-old girl who really wants to be a musician"".Her song, With Love From Paris, is a sumptuous, melancholy ballad whose refrain - ""maybe one day I will see you soon"" - pre-dates the lockdown, but has taken on added resonance over the last eight weeks.She decided to ask out-of-work musicians to complete the track after recalling the long weekends she would spend playing piano bars in Philadelphia as a teenager.""I remember playing gigs for food, just to get dinner,"" she remembers. "" Then it got a little better and I do the gig to get 25 bucks and then 50. I was hustling, you know? And I know musicians are in that place right now. ""They don't know how they're going to get by, they need to put some bread on the table, and all of a sudden, not only can they contribute [to this song], doing something they love, but at the end of the day, there's a pay check coming in.""Gardot isn't the only artist leveraging her influence to help others. Pop star Charli XCX has spent the last six weeks recording a new album from scratch in her house - partly to keep herself sane, but also because she realised her regular collaborators would be struggling to make ends meet.""There are a lot of other creative people who can't work during this time,"" she told the BBC last month. ""So, for me, doing this project is also a way to support some of those people, whether that be video editors, or the painters who are doing my artwork, or 3D designers, or video directors.""Indie band The National are donating all profits from their merchandise store to their road crew; while Good Charlotte's Joel and Benji Madden have re-tooled their e-commerce site Veeps to help other bands raise money.The site, which started out as a way to market VIP packages for concert tours, now allows artists to sell tickets to streaming online gigs. So far, it's been embraced by musicians like Angel Olsen, Bat For Lashes and All Time Low, who've used the income to support their touring crew, raise money for charity or offset lost earnings.Typically, the artists are those who can't afford to stage pro-bono live-streams on Instagram - or who are wary of Facebook and Spotify's ""tipping"" systems, which can both produce varying results.All of these ideas are all still taking shape, but they're going to prove crucial if the industry is to survive.Gardot says she hopes other artists will follow her lead in paying musicians for recording their parts at home.""We got to get some of the big cats on board, like John Mayer or Ed Sheeran, and keep creating opportunities for other people,"" she says.That could be crucial, says FitzRoy, as it could be a long time before things return to normal. Although recording studios could re-open in June, with an initial backlog of work to get through, the picture is a little less rosy further down the line.""There's no live work, so a lot of artists won't have had any income, so they won't be able to afford to make records,"" she says. ""And the fact that film production has ground to a halt means that, in six months' time, those projects that should have been recording scores at the big studios just won't be happening.""So there'll be a little bump of activity when things resume, but the longer-term effects are going to be with us for the next couple of years.""Echoing calls made by UK Music earlier this week, FitzRoy says the government should work closely with the industry to make sure it survives as the UK emerges from lockdown.""The music industry makes a lot of money for them in the good times,"" she says. ""They need to think about that.""",14 May 2020,entertainment
Music royalties reach a record high - but a storm is coming,"Musicians and songwriters in the UK received a record amount of money last year, but the loss of live music poses a major threat to income in 2020.The warning was issued by PRS for Music, the body that makes sure 145,000 songwriters, composers and publishers in the UK are paid when their music is played or performed around the world.The organisation collected a record ¬£810m last year, a rise of 8.7%.But it said Covid-19 would result in an ""inevitable decline"" in 2020 and 2021.""Even though we had a record-breaking year, we know very well that we're in unprecedented, unpredictable times,"" chief executive Andrea Martin told the BBC.Revenues from ""live music and public performance will be hit"" not just in 2020 but in 2021, as international payments often take time to trickle down, she said.""There will be a downfall,"" she added. ""But by how much and by what per cent... your guess is just as good as mine.""The situation will hit smaller acts, many of whom were already struggling before the pandemic, the hardest.PRS processed 18.8 trillion ""performances"" of music last year, including streams, downloads, radio and TV broadcasts, and music played in pubs, clubs, hairdressers and concert venues. UK songwriters contributed to many of the year's most-played hits, including like Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi, Old Town Road by Lil Nas X and Don't Call Me Up by Mabel.Live music generated ¬£54m in royalties, up ¬£15m since 2018. Revenues were boosted by major tours from the Spice Girls, Sir Elton John, Ed Sheeran and the return of Glastonbury after a fallow year in 2018.But with an entire summer of festivals cancelled and dozens of major tours postponed until 2021, that figure will be impossible to recreate in next year's results.Last week, UK Music revealed the contribution of live music to the UK economy is set to drop in 2020 from an estimated ¬£1.1bn to ¬£200m, describing it as a ""catastrophic"" blow to the industry.Meanwhile, the Ivors Academy of songwriters and composers said it anticipated a loss of ¬£25,000 per member over a six-month period.The lockdown also means songwriters will lose out on royalties gathered when their music is played in shops, cinemas, pubs, clubs and restaurants. In 2019, that figure was ¬£168.2m.There is some good news, however. Royalties from music streaming rose 22.1% to ¬£155m, while the money generated from music on video-on-demand services like Amazon and Netflix increased 47.5% to ¬£17.7m.Early figures suggest more people have taken out streaming subscriptions during the lockdown, which may provide a small counterweight to the loss of live music.But many musicians have noted that the money they receive from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon is not enough to sustain a career.Tom Gray from indie band Gomez recently shared a chart, originally compiled by The Trichordist, showing how many streams artists require to make a living in the UK.On YouTube, a song would have to be played 7,267 times to generate ¬£8.72 - or one hour of minimum wage. On Spotify, the figure was 3,114 streams, and on Apple Music 1,615 streams.Terrifying. The most up-to-date streaming rates adapted for ¬£ and for UK minimum wage. Data from the excellent  @thetrichordist.  #BrokenRecord pic.twitter.com/XOoZ3IGisTEnd of Twitter post  by @MrTomGrayThat has led to a campaign, #BrokenRecord, seeking a more equitable system of distributing streaming money.Spearheaded by the Ivors Academy and the Musicians' Union, it is calling for a new system, where your subscription fee is distributed to the artists you actually listen to - rather than going into a central pot, where money is split between the most-streamed songs on a percentage basis.""This is what the consumer wants,"" said Graham Davies of the Ivors Academy, who is calling for a government-backed review.""They want their ¬£9.99 a month to be paid to the artists, performers, songwriters and composers of the music they love.""In the meantime, the PRS Emergency Relief Fund has raised more than ¬£2.1m to help members who have lost income as a result of Covid-19. Martin says 1,600 songwriters have applied for assistance in the last week alone.Another ¬£5m fund, set up by the charity Help Musicians, ran out of cash within a week after being launched in March.Trade body UK Music has subsequently called on the government to set up a new taskforce to revive the music industry as it navigates the pandemic.",14 May 2020,entertainment
'We're clinging on' - theatre leaders discuss lockdown turmoil,"Theatres will be among the last places to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown is lifted, meaning venues, actors and crews are fearing for their futures.The appeal of the theatre - cramming into an enclosed space with hundreds of strangers to share a communal experience - has suddenly become its greatest risk.Box office takings have dried up virtually overnight. Reopening with social distancing will not make financial sense. One venue, the Nuffield in Southampton, has already gone into administration.Below, four artistic directors discuss how and when they might reopen, and warn of dire consequences if income and funding dry up.The theatre industry is badly wounded, according to Young Vic artistic director Kwame Kwei-Armah's analogy. ""Right now we're at the tourniquet stage,"" he says. ""We're trying to stem the bleeding.""Then we're going to have to stand up, and then we're going to have to run. And we're going to need help at each stage in order to get back to - not even the way it was, but to get back to something that is sustainable and safe.""He believes the south London venue and others like it have enough money to keep going until the autumn. Arts Council England has made ¬£90m of emergency funding available to keep organisations afloat until the end of September.After that, they will need a government bailout. Without one ""many of us will fall off a cliff"" in the subsequent months, Kwei-Armah explains.The key to reopening will be an end to social distancing. ""It's almost impossible economically to socially distance a theatre,"" he says.""In order to social distance at 2m, we would lose three quarters of our audience. And then we have to work out how you create safe space for the rest of the staff - backstage and in a rehearsal room.""And then we have to work out what the public appetite might be towards coming back into a theatre.""It will then take three months to get back up and running, taking staffing and rehearsals into account, he adds.The Young Vic is planning different reopening scenarios up to next April - more than a year after going dark.The venue has furloughed most staff but has continued some work - reaching 100 members of its young directors scheme online every day, and running a local playwriting programme. Staff are also making food deliveries for a local charity.When theatres do turn the lights back on, Kwei-Armah says those who have often been excluded in the past must be present.""From class to race to gender, we have made great progress over the last few years in our sector in trying to equalise it,"" he says.""I'm determined absolutely that all of that progress that we've made cannot go for naught. We have to rebuild with that as a fundamental.""The Young Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire will be streamed by the National Theatre from 21 May.Coronavirus hasn't stopped the youth and elders groups at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre making a show together - they have just done it online.The five episodes of Connect Fest, about an ageing band reforming for a festival, are being released daily this week.""We're still trying to do what we are here to do, which is to give people moments of connection through art,"" says joint artistic director Roy Alexander Weise.""It's hard, though, because the team who are producing that piece of work has been cut down because we've had to furlough close to 90% of our staff to help keep ourselves afloat financially, because we aren't making the money that we would do.""When the venue does eventually reopen, Weise and co-artistic director Bryony Shanahan are also thinking about socially-distanced shows.""It doesn't necessarily make financial sense for us to do that,"" he says. ""But we understand that our purpose is greater than financial gain. It is far greater - it's connection, wellbeing, equal opportunities.""So I guess, just like everyone else, we're clinging on for dear life trying to see what will happen next, and all we can do is prepare ourselves as best we can to brace for whatever the landscape looks like.""Producing shows is going to feel incredibly difficult to do in the coming months.""How will the pandemic change theatre? Weise says many people are afraid of ""a huge regression"" in the types of plays and voices heard, seeking refuge in ""plays that they know will sell"".He goes so far as to say some think ""it might be a good thing for some institutions to go"" - venues that ""for a very long time have been led by lots of people who all look the same, who invite the same audiences in.""He's focusing on his theatre's purpose and why it stages the shows it does. ""We've all got more than enough time now to think about our why as artistic leaders.""The current hiatus is a chance to prepare for allowing a wider range of people to tell their stories, he says. ""Narrative is everything. It really does rule the world.""We have a real opportunity to allow people to understand the power of story, allow people to step into some of that power, who maybe haven't been able to step into that power before, and see the exciting ways in which our world can progress.""When the Royal Court shut in March, it put the words ""Back Soon"" up in big letters on the front of its building in west London. But how soon?""We keep coming up with different scenarios for when we could open and how we could open, and we alight on one thing, and then that slips,"" artistic director Vicky Featherstone says.""The closest I can imagine being able to invite a full capacity audience is around January.""It's too risky to commit the money for a big production before that. ""If there was another spike [in infections], or actors get ill, we would have to stop again and that would be really damaging.""That doesn't necessarily mean the building will be totally shut until 2021. Featherstone is trying to think of ""creative, socially distanced ways"" to host events, perhaps for young people, in the autumn. ""Something more playful and hopeful, a bit more radical, reckless, for much, much smaller groups of people,"" she explains.As well as thinking about how to make members of the public feel safe, she is preoccupied by the predicaments of the freelancers who work on their shows. All plays that had been announced will go ahead - at some point.""We have a massive freelance and self-employed workforce that I think we have taken for granted. And now we need to think about how they are supported.""Most of the theatre's education and outreach work has continued digitally, and it has put David Ireland's play Cyprus Avenue online. The Royal Court website is now showing a live feed of the empty theatre.Theatres play a crucial role, she says, citing research that (in normal times) more people go to theatres than to Premier League football matches. They are also where many people in film and TV learn their craft.Featherstone points to Alice Birch, who came through the Royal Court's ranks before co-writing BBC Three's hit drama Normal People.""We all need stories and we all need our imaginations to be fired up,"" Featherstone says. ""From Shakespeare onwards, we have absolutely led the world. We want to be able to continue that.""Pitlochry Festival Theatre in the Scottish Highlands has postponed its summer season, which had been due to start next week.But artistic director Elizabeth Newman has been busy organising activities, like a phone line for actors to have chats with lonely locals; three daily rays of ""Light Hope Joy"" on social media; and 50 works of art dedicated to the River Tay.One of the summer shows, David Greig's new play Adventures with the Painted People, is being made for BBC Radio 3 instead.""We've tried to remain a producing organisation that is making art,"" Newman says. ""On the one hand we're doing that and on the other, myself and Kris [Bryce], the executive director, are working around the clock to work out how we can survive this crisis.""That means working out how to stage socially-distanced shows. ""We need to be looking at how we can make work that adheres to government guidelines, but also we need to make sure that we're solvent,"" she says.If they tried to socially distance the 538-capacity auditorium, they would only be able to admit 70 people, which ""is not financially viable"". So Newman and Bryce are looking beyond the building to its 11-acre grounds.""We're going to have to conceive programmes of work that are not necessarily in the auditorium and are outside, and are quality and rich for our audience, but not necessarily about them being shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers.""Those are the ideas I'm coming up with - work outdoors, different kinds of performances, different kinds of events, different kinds of social happenings that can occur, but that don't place peoples' lives at risk.""The theatre is the biggest employer in the area, but there are likely to be redundancies. ""I feel that weight very heavily on my shoulders,"" Newman says.""Some tough decisions are going to have to be made. And it's not going to be small changes, it's going to be big changes for a time. And that feels incredibly painful if I'm honest.""Newman says Creative Scotland hasn't been in a position to offer extra financial support, so she is hoping for an extra package from the UK government.""It's going to be the last industry that's going to be able to get up to full function, and we're just praying that they're going to come back with some sort of relief and support.""Adventures with the Painted People is on Radio 3 on 7 June.In response to a question about theatres at Wednesday's Downing Street briefing, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""All of us who care about the arts are very concerned for the future of theatres, museums and galleries, performing arts, all of those who work in the sector.""The arts are ""incredibly important to the UK"" and ""one of our great international strengths"" as well as being ""important for our wellbeing"", he said.Many arts organisations have had government support through the furlough scheme, while self-employed people could access grants, he explained.""The culture secretary is also working very closely with our main cultural institutions to see how we can guide them through undoubtedly a very difficult time, and to put in place the social distancing guidelines so they are ready to reopen when the science and medical opinion allows,"" he continued.""We hope that that will be later this summer,"" he added, citing the plan for easing the lockdown, which was published earlier this week. ""But it is very conditional on continuing to keep the rate of infection down, and continuing to control the virus.""",14 May 2020,entertainment
How live entertainment is evolving online to be a lifeline in lockdown,"From gigs to plays and quizzes, live entertainment has moved online during coronavirus lockdown - and creative minds are coming up with new ideas to give us back some of the human connection we've lost.Every Saturday for the past two months, Snow Patrol singer Gary Lightbody has sat down and written a song.Well, he has co-written a song - with 5,000 fans on Instagram.He asks them for chords, comes up with melodies, and puts them to a vote. He then asks for ideas for lyrics before coming back an hour later with a finished track. ""Some are really good,"" he says. End of Youtube post  by Snow PatrolLightbody also performs solo online gigs from home, but wanted to do something more collaborative too.""You can say absolutely anything in this. It's therapeutic and cathartic for me,"" he explains.""In a 'gig', I chat a little bit, but you can't really read the comments because you're playing songs. But with this, it feels like you're engaging with everybody.""The fans also vote for the set lists in his regular online concerts. ""I could just choose a bunch of songs that I want to play, which I did do one week and it just didn't really work,"" Lightbody says. ""It just felt a little disconnected.""I miss playing live, I do. But it's going to be a long time, so this is what we've got.""With the communal thrill of congregating in the same room currently out of the question, Lightbody is among the artists to have come up with interesting ways to bring people together.When his Saturday Songwrite sessions have generated 10 or 12 decent tracks, he'll release an album for charity - although he hasn't settled on a charity yet. ""It might be best to put that to a vote as well.""Few musicians haven't done online performances, which can have an intimate charm (but can also be quite dull, beyond the voyeuristic kick of having a nosey in their houses).Lightbody recommends fellow Northern Irish singer Roe, who could teach the bigger names a thing or two about audio and video quality.This was filmed in isolation with Jay Dickson on the drums. We thought this would be a cool thing to do right now seeing...End of Facebook post  by ROESome performers get their fans involved - whether by taking requests or doing Q&As, virtual charity festivals or tutorials like Duran Duran star John Taylor with his bass masterclasses and Oti Mabuse with her dance lessons.Listening parties have also been a big hit. Charlatans frontman Tim Burgess has carved out a sideline as host of #timstwitterlisteningparty. Fans and musicians listen together in real time, tweeting their thoughts and memories.""There's power in listening and knowing others are doing so at the same as you,"" Burgess told The Sunday Times.In the US, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland - who staged a song-for-song producer clash in 2018 - now run a regular lockdown face-off, inviting different stars to go head-to-head in weekly Verzuz battles on Instagram.Erykah Badu and Jill Scott's recent battle was more of a love-in, and drew 700,000 live viewers.The New York Times has called Verzuz ""perhaps the most powerful quarantine-friendly entertainment franchise going"".Last night's #VERZUZ was special ‚ú® Thank you @fatbellybella and @missjillscott üôè@Timbaland @THEREALSWIZZZ pic.twitter.com/8iOLySRompEnd of Twitter post  by @verzuzonlineBeyond music, lockdown may turn out to be a tipping point for activities like quizzes, choirs, and exercise, yoga and cookery lessons, which have found new leases of life online (despite the inevitable loss of the human touch).In theatre, as in music, it's hard to replicate the live experience on screen. But some are using technology to create a new kind of show.Although monologues have been filmed in lockdown and pre-recorded shows have been put online, they often can't capture the excitement of being in an audience. Plus, the magical, fantastical storytelling of theatre doesn't translate well to the screen.""What doesn't work is watching streaming of plays on computers,"" playwright Simon Stephens told BBC Radio 4's Front Row last week. ""Whenever I watch those I just feel lonelier than I felt before.""What is interesting is when writers, directors, actors and designers start thinking about - what are the dramatic potentials of Zoom?""In recent weeks, creative types have been exploring just that.David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman and Denise Gough starred in A Separate Peace, a one-act play by Sir Tom Stoppard on Zoom.""I'm fascinated by the format, which is a completely new kind of way of putting on a play where paradoxically you stay home and live theatre comes to you,"" Sir Tom said.The show tried to replicate something of the live experience, with audience members buying a ticket in advance and turning up at an allotted time - the performance deliberately wasn't put online to watch afterwards.It had professional crew, including video, lighting, costume and sound designers, and the actors (all at home, obviously) entered and exited their quarters of the screen as they would a stage. ""The cast were saying they were so nervous, like 'I really felt like I was standing in the wings,'"" says producer Matt Humphrey.""We want to show other people that this can be done and give confidence to other people that live theatre still has a place during lockdown."" And he believes such Zoom-style shows will still have a place when quarantine lifts.The Guardian's five-star review declared: ""If, for however long, this is live theatre's future, then it works triumphantly.""Another Zoom theatre triumph got the audience fully involved from their sofas.In a playful version of The Tempest from Northern Ireland-based theatre company Big Telly and Oxford's Creation Theatre, viewers were asked to help out by doing things like making storm sound effects and pretending to be a flock of birds. The most enthusiastic were spotlighted on screen for the rest of the audience to see.Another show, Operation Elsewhere, was originally ""an immersive theatre game"" played in the real world.  When the world locked down, it was hastily reworked for Zoom - also with lots of audience participation.""People turn all the lights off and get under blankets because we need cover of darkness,"" Big Telly artistic director Zoe Seaton explains.

""I'm really enjoying it because it feels like a new box of tricks, a new way of telling stories,"" Seaton says.People have been tuning in from around the world and using the shows to have a shared night ""out"" with separated family members.""The joy of seeing your nephew and niece in Canada doing something in the same show that you're part of has just been amazing,"" Seaton says. ""We're interested in taking that further.""We work in rural communities in Ireland mostly, as well as Belfast and Derry, and suddenly our audience are in Brooklyn, and you think, oh gosh!""The key has been inviting the audience to bring the shows to life, Seaton adds. ""They have had that sense of community that theatre has, where you're all on the same journey. ""That's their main success. I think that's what people are missing in lockdown - that sense of community.""",18 May 2020,entertainment
