Emily Maitlis: I asked for night off from BBC's Newsnight,"Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis has said she did not present the BBC Two programme on Wednesday because ""I asked for the night off"".She responded to suggestions that the BBC had replaced her after it said her introduction about Dominic Cummings on Tuesday's show did not meet the required standards of due impartiality.Newsnight's UK editor Katie Razzall presented the programme instead.Maitlis said she knew the show ""would be in the most excellent hands"".She tweeted on Thursday morning to say she had been ""overwhelmed by all the kindness, messages - and support on here - and I've probably missed much of it. A big thank you from us all at #newsnight"".Razzall said on Wednesday evening she ""wouldn't have agreed to present the show"" if Maitlis had been asked to take the night off.The programme's editor Esme Wren said Maitlis ""hasn't been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement"". Deputy editor Stewart Maclean added: ""For the avoidance of doubt, @maitlis has neither 'been replaced' nor 'been taken off air' for this evening's Newsnight"".So grateful to my friend and excellent colleague @katierazz for stepping in this evening . She did so because I asked for the night off -knowing tonight‚Äôs prog would be in the most excellent hands üñê #newsnight https://t.co/0ZkH2KbzBFEnd of Twitter post  by @maitlisMaitlis is not scheduled to present the show again this week - Emma Barnett is fronting Thursday's programme, with Kirsty Wark on Friday.Tuesday's programme opened with Maitlis saying ""the country can see"" government adviser Mr Cummings had ""broken the rules"".The BBC said the show should have made clear the remarks were ""a summary of the questions we would examine"" about the prime minister's aide.It added the news programme's staff had been reminded about its guidelines.At the beginning of the BBC Two programme, Maitlis said the country was ""shocked"" that the government could not see that Boris Johnson's aide had broken the rules by travelling from London to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown.She said the ""public mood"" was ""one of fury, contempt and anguish"", and that Mr Cummings had made people who struggled to keep to the government's rules ""feel like fools"".She continued: ""The prime minister knows all this. But despite the resignation of one minister, growing unease from his backbenchers, a dramatic early warning from the polls and a deep national disquiet, Boris Johnson has chosen to ignore it.""Tonight we consider what this blind loyalty tells us about the workings of Number 10.""In a statement on Wednesday, the BBC said it had ""reviewed the entirety of last night's Newsnight, including the opening section"".""While we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme,"" it continued.""As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality.""On Thursday, media regulator Ofcom said it had received 247 complaints about Maitlis's opening remarks.Mr Cummings' 260-mile journey has been the focus of intense media scrutiny since coming to light last week.On Monday, the prime minister's most senior adviser explained that he decided to make the trip because he felt it would be better to self-isolate in a place where he had options for childcare if required.On Wednesday, Boris Johnson ruled out an inquiry into his adviser's conduct, insisting it was time to ""move on"" from the row.",28 May 2020,entertainment
BBC Proms hope to include two weeks of live concerts at Royal Albert Hall,"This year's BBC Proms will combine archive recordings and live concerts - with audiences at the Royal Albert Hall if coronavirus restrictions allow.Organisers said the ""ambition"" is for musicians to perform at the London venue for the last two weeks of the two-month classical music festival.It will culminate with a ""poignant and unique"" Last Night of the Proms on 12 September, they said.A virtual ""mash-up"" of Beethoven's nine symphonies will kick off the season. More than 350 musicians will be heard performing together on 17 July after recording their parts at home.Proms director David Pickard said the piece, arranged by Iain Farrington, would involve ""the most ambitious lockdown orchestra ever"".The 2020 season will continue with TV, radio and online broadcasts of past Proms, some chosen by the public.Pickard said he was ""very hopeful"" live concerts would follow at the end of August.Performers, from soloists to ensembles, will be booked nearer the time when social distancing rules for the period become clear.Earlier this month, Katherine Jenkins performed inside the empty Albert Hall for the VE Day 75th anniversary.An audience during the live Proms events has not been ruled out, depending on government advice at the time.Pickard said the Last Night of the Proms would ""look and sound very different"" but would still evoke ""the same elation"" as always.He promised ""a stimulating and enriching musical summer for both loyal Proms audiences and people discovering the riches we have to offer for the first time"".A host of major events, among them this year's Glastonbury music festival, have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Pickard said cancelling the Proms this year had been an option but to have done so would have been ""a terrible opportunity missed"".",28 May 2020,entertainment
The High Note: Why Tracee Ellis Ross 'only got better with age',"Usually, when a Hollywood star has a new movie coming out, they fly to London for a publicity blitz.They'll often take part in a press junket, which is where the film company hires out an entire floor of an expensive hotel and invites journalists to come and interview them. It's efficient for the actors, because they can knock off several interviews in one day, and in one place. There's usually a lot of hanging around for the journalists - but if you're lucky you get a free Diet Coke and a biscuit while you're waiting.But just like pub quizzes, office meetings and first dates, promoting a new Hollywood movie has moved online to Zoom - where sadly there are no free snacks.At the the launch of the movie The High Note, journalists are shuffled between different virtual meeting rooms, waiting to speak with the film's star Tracee Ellis Ross.Thanks to lockdown, the actress is launching and promoting the movie entirely from her own living room.""It's wonderful, but I miss people,"" Ross tells BBC News. ""I don't have shoes on, so that's nice! I'm at home, that's nice too. But I wouldn't mind seeing you face-to-face and being in your energy, that always makes a difference. But actually, it is nice to be able to do these things even though we're in a pandemic, and to do them safely.""The High Note tells the story of soul singer Grace Davis (Ross) and her assistant Maggie (Fifty Shades star Dakota Johnson), who is an aspiring music producer herself.Grace (who is not to be confused with the 2017 X Factor runner-up Grace Davies) is in the autumn of her career. A pop star over 40, she is no longer having number one hits and her manager is encouraging her to start a Vegas residency to keep the money coming in. The character isn't based on anyone specific - but there are plenty of singers who have followed the Vegas route in real life, including Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Toni Braxton.The role marks the first time Ross has ever been heard singing. And pressure is high - her mother is Motown legend Diana Ross. ""It was my childhood dream, I always wanted to sing,"" she says. ""I didn't put it away, but I think the longer you wait to do certain things the more frightening they get... The idea of comparison because of who my mom is, or the judgement of doing it now at this age, became bigger than the dream. So when this role came along, I was like, 'it's time'.""Ross is best known in the US for starring in TV series including Girlfriends and Black-ish. Her performance in the latter earned her a Golden Globe Award in 2017 for best TV comedy actress. The High Note marks her first on-screen film role since 2009. She says her successful TV career has been ""incredibly fulfilling"", but adds: ""The truth is it's left me little desire to pursue certain things, because I'm tired and I have a full schedule, but it takes something I'm really excited about and then I'm like 'this is it'.""Ross says she was drawn to the message of the story - which she characterises as being about two women, each pursuing their own dream regardless of what others want from them.Notably, the two women are ""not against each other"", as Ross puts it. ""The dynamic that both of us developed was not the characteristic stereotypical schtick between diva and assistant. We were able to find this real friendship connection that was in there, that kind of gave it the right tone.""Flora Greeson's screenplay makes much of Grace's age. One scene sees Grace point to how few singers over 40 still score number one hits, especially female artists.A frustration with ageism is one thing Ross shares with her character. ""What I know is I have only gotten better with age,"" she says. ""I think I'm the sexiest I've ever been, and I'm almost 50. And I think of the other women who are in this age bracket and beyond, and I think, 'why was there ever a message of counting us out?' That seems absurd. ""You think of Jennifer Lopez, Marisa Tomei, the list goes on of extraordinary women, and there's so much to offer at this age. My mom on stage now at 76 is like, I think she's better than she's ever been!""For Ross herself, being in her 40s hasn't stopped her from experiencing the most successful decade of her career.""I don't think youth is everything, I just don't,"" Ross says. ""That wonderful expression 'youth is wasted on the young' is great. I mean there are so many good things about youth, but I don't wanna go back, I'll tell you that right now - I wouldn't go back to my 20s if you paid me.""Early reviews of The High Note - which is directed by Nisha Ganatra - have been largely positive, albeit not glowing. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the film ""does have much to recommend it, at least during these lean times"".""It's the kind of plush, pleasurable comfort viewing that goes down as easily as a favourite artist's hits compilation,"" he added.The Daily Mirror's Lewis Knight said: ""Ultimately, it's a credit to the lead actresses of The High Note that it remains so watchable despite being rather formulaic and containing some predictable plot turns and twists.""The film is one of several which had originally been due to open in cinemas this spring. Most of the others - including Mulan, Fast & Furious 9 and No Time To Die - postponed their release until later in the year, in the hope cinemas will be open again.But some studios have instead decided to release their films online for movie fans to rent at home. Trolls World Tour was the first major film out of the gate to do this, and now The High Note is skipping cinemas too.""I'm actually kind of excited,"" Ross says. ""Don't get me wrong, I wanted to see myself on the big screen as Grace Davis, but I have a pretty big TV screen! I feel like there's something really wonderful and intimate about being able to meet people where they are, in their homes.""I can only speak for myself, and right now I don't know that I wanna go and sit in a movie theatre. That doesn't sound like something I wanna do, I'm happy to watch a movie, right here, on the couch!""Audience trepidation about returning to crowded spaces after the coronavirus pandemic could spell serious financial trouble for cinemas, which are already struggling with the loss of income under lockdown. The industry's future is uncertain, to put it mildly. ""I think normal is going to be reshaped for all of us,"" Ross acknowledges, ""so we can respond to the reality of what we're living in and still have joyful experiences and still receive entertainment and expand our lives by watching these stories in a way that matches the reality of where we are.""The High Note is available to rent from Friday 29 May from digital retailers.",28 May 2020,entertainment
Larry Kramer: Elton John leads tributes to playwright and Aids activist,"Stars including Sir Elton John, Julia Roberts and Lin-Manuel Miranda have paid tribute to US playwright, author and Aids activist Larry Kramer.Kramer died this week at the age of 84.He was a pivotal and confrontational figure during the Aids crisis in the 1980s, and depicted the era in his landmark 1985 play The Normal Heart.Sir Elton John tweeted that it was ""the saddest news"" and that the world had ""lost a giant of a man who stood up for gay rights like a warrior"".Roberts, who starred alongside Mark Ruffalo in the movie adaptation of The Normal Heart, told Variety: ""He was ferocious and tireless in his beliefs.""A true hero that so many people owe their lives to today. I was honoured to spend time in his orbit.""""Rest in power, King!"" added Ruffalo online.Kramer had made his name as a screenwriter, earning an Oscar nomination in 1971 for adapting DH Lawrence's Women in Love.He also published the best-selling but controversial novel Faggots in 1977.At the start of the 1980s, he put his energies into rallying support and awareness for the fight against HIV and Aids.His other plays included 1992's autobiographical The Destiny of Me.Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda posted that the ""extraordinary writer"" touched the lives of all those who saw his work. ""Thank you, Larry Kramer,"" he wrote.""Larry Kramer changed my core,"" said actress Ellen Barkin, who won a Tony Award in 2011 for her role in a Broadway revival of The Normal Heart.Director and producer Ryan Murphy, who brought the groundbreaking play to the big screen, remembered Kramer as ""the single greatest and most important gay activist of all time"".Kramer first became aware of HIV and Aids after friends living next door in New York died. ""No-one was saying anything,"" he later said.""I often make the comparison with a war reporter whose parachute drops behind enemy lines and he realises he's faced with the greatest story he can tell. I was not a political person before all this.""After a meeting of about 80 people in his apartment in 1982, he helped found Gay Men's Health Crisis and began fundraising, campaigning and writing about the subject.""You should have seen the faces,"" he said of that meeting. ""We all had friends who died... If one of us had it, we all had it.""He later formed Act Up, a radical protest group, and in 1989 learned he was HIV positive himself and suffering from liver damage.He had a liver transplant in 2001 and was given experimental HIV drugs by Anthony Fauci - the medical researcher now leading the fight against the coronavirus in the US.Dr Fauci told the New York Times: ""Once you got past the rhetoric, you found that Larry Kramer made a lot of sense, and that he had a heart of gold.""Kramer's friend and literary executor Will Schwalbe said the playwright's death was not related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Asked by the BBC World Service in 1995 whether it was possible to be both an activist and a writer, Kramer replied: ""Why not? The question that occurs to me all the time is why so few other writers are.""What annoys me so much about England and America is most of the writers are so removed from politics.""",28 May 2020,entertainment

The High Note: Why Tracee Ellis Ross 'only got better with age',"Usually, when a Hollywood star has a new movie coming out, they fly to London for a publicity blitz.They'll often take part in a press junket, which is where the film company hires out an entire floor of an expensive hotel and invites journalists to come and interview them. It's efficient for the actors, because they can knock off several interviews in one day, and in one place. There's usually a lot of hanging around for the journalists - but if you're lucky you get a free Diet Coke and a biscuit while you're waiting.But just like pub quizzes, office meetings and first dates, promoting a new Hollywood movie has moved online to Zoom - where sadly there are no free snacks.At the the launch of the movie The High Note, journalists are shuffled between different virtual meeting rooms, waiting to speak with the film's star Tracee Ellis Ross.Thanks to lockdown, the actress is launching and promoting the movie entirely from her own living room.""It's wonderful, but I miss people,"" Ross tells BBC News. ""I don't have shoes on, so that's nice! I'm at home, that's nice too. But I wouldn't mind seeing you face-to-face and being in your energy, that always makes a difference. But actually, it is nice to be able to do these things even though we're in a pandemic, and to do them safely.""The High Note tells the story of soul singer Grace Davis (Ross) and her assistant Maggie (Fifty Shades star Dakota Johnson), who is an aspiring music producer herself.Grace (who is not to be confused with the 2017 X Factor runner-up Grace Davies) is in the autumn of her career. A pop star over 40, she is no longer having number one hits and her manager is encouraging her to start a Vegas residency to keep the money coming in. The character isn't based on anyone specific - but there are plenty of singers who have followed the Vegas route in real life, including Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Toni Braxton.The role marks the first time Ross has ever been heard singing. And pressure is high - her mother is Motown legend Diana Ross. ""It was my childhood dream, I always wanted to sing,"" she says. ""I didn't put it away, but I think the longer you wait to do certain things the more frightening they get... The idea of comparison because of who my mom is, or the judgement of doing it now at this age, became bigger than the dream. So when this role came along, I was like, 'it's time'.""Ross is best known in the US for starring in TV series including Girlfriends and Black-ish. Her performance in the latter earned her a Golden Globe Award in 2017 for best TV comedy actress. The High Note marks her first on-screen film role since 2009. She says her successful TV career has been ""incredibly fulfilling"", but adds: ""The truth is it's left me little desire to pursue certain things, because I'm tired and I have a full schedule, but it takes something I'm really excited about and then I'm like 'this is it'.""Ross says she was drawn to the message of the story - which she characterises as being about two women, each pursuing their own dream regardless of what others want from them.Notably, the two women are ""not against each other"", as Ross puts it. ""The dynamic that both of us developed was not the characteristic stereotypical schtick between diva and assistant. We were able to find this real friendship connection that was in there, that kind of gave it the right tone.""Flora Greeson's screenplay makes much of Grace's age. One scene sees Grace point to how few singers over 40 still score number one hits, especially female artists.A frustration with ageism is one thing Ross shares with her character. ""What I know is I have only gotten better with age,"" she says. ""I think I'm the sexiest I've ever been, and I'm almost 50. And I think of the other women who are in this age bracket and beyond, and I think, 'why was there ever a message of counting us out?' That seems absurd. ""You think of Jennifer Lopez, Marisa Tomei, the list goes on of extraordinary women, and there's so much to offer at this age. My mom on stage now at 76 is like, I think she's better than she's ever been!""For Ross herself, being in her 40s hasn't stopped her from experiencing the most successful decade of her career.""I don't think youth is everything, I just don't,"" Ross says. ""That wonderful expression 'youth is wasted on the young' is great. I mean there are so many good things about youth, but I don't wanna go back, I'll tell you that right now - I wouldn't go back to my 20s if you paid me.""Early reviews of The High Note - which is directed by Nisha Ganatra - have been largely positive, albeit not glowing. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the film ""does have much to recommend it, at least during these lean times"".""It's the kind of plush, pleasurable comfort viewing that goes down as easily as a favourite artist's hits compilation,"" he added.The Daily Mirror's Lewis Knight said: ""Ultimately, it's a credit to the lead actresses of The High Note that it remains so watchable despite being rather formulaic and containing some predictable plot turns and twists.""The film is one of several which had originally been due to open in cinemas this spring. Most of the others - including Mulan, Fast & Furious 9 and No Time To Die - postponed their release until later in the year, in the hope cinemas will be open again.But some studios have instead decided to release their films online for movie fans to rent at home. Trolls World Tour was the first major film out of the gate to do this, and now The High Note is skipping cinemas too.""I'm actually kind of excited,"" Ross says. ""Don't get me wrong, I wanted to see myself on the big screen as Grace Davis, but I have a pretty big TV screen! I feel like there's something really wonderful and intimate about being able to meet people where they are, in their homes.""I can only speak for myself, and right now I don't know that I wanna go and sit in a movie theatre. That doesn't sound like something I wanna do, I'm happy to watch a movie, right here, on the couch!""Audience trepidation about returning to crowded spaces after the coronavirus pandemic could spell serious financial trouble for cinemas, which are already struggling with the loss of income under lockdown. The industry's future is uncertain, to put it mildly. ""I think normal is going to be reshaped for all of us,"" Ross acknowledges, ""so we can respond to the reality of what we're living in and still have joyful experiences and still receive entertainment and expand our lives by watching these stories in a way that matches the reality of where we are.""The High Note is available to rent from Friday 29 May from digital retailers.",28 May 2020,entertainment
Larry Kramer: Elton John leads tributes to playwright and Aids activist,"Stars including Sir Elton John, Julia Roberts and Lin-Manuel Miranda have paid tribute to US playwright, author and Aids activist Larry Kramer.Kramer died this week at the age of 84.He was a pivotal and confrontational figure during the Aids crisis in the 1980s, and depicted the era in his landmark 1985 play The Normal Heart.Sir Elton John tweeted that it was ""the saddest news"" and that the world had ""lost a giant of a man who stood up for gay rights like a warrior"".Roberts, who starred alongside Mark Ruffalo in the movie adaptation of The Normal Heart, told Variety: ""He was ferocious and tireless in his beliefs.""A true hero that so many people owe their lives to today. I was honoured to spend time in his orbit.""""Rest in power, King!"" added Ruffalo online.Kramer had made his name as a screenwriter, earning an Oscar nomination in 1971 for adapting DH Lawrence's Women in Love.He also published the best-selling but controversial novel Faggots in 1977.At the start of the 1980s, he put his energies into rallying support and awareness for the fight against HIV and Aids.His other plays included 1992's autobiographical The Destiny of Me.Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda posted that the ""extraordinary writer"" touched the lives of all those who saw his work. ""Thank you, Larry Kramer,"" he wrote.""Larry Kramer changed my core,"" said actress Ellen Barkin, who won a Tony Award in 2011 for her role in a Broadway revival of The Normal Heart.Director and producer Ryan Murphy, who brought the groundbreaking play to the big screen, remembered Kramer as ""the single greatest and most important gay activist of all time"".Kramer first became aware of HIV and Aids after friends living next door in New York died. ""No-one was saying anything,"" he later said.""I often make the comparison with a war reporter whose parachute drops behind enemy lines and he realises he's faced with the greatest story he can tell. I was not a political person before all this.""After a meeting of about 80 people in his apartment in 1982, he helped found Gay Men's Health Crisis and began fundraising, campaigning and writing about the subject.""You should have seen the faces,"" he said of that meeting. ""We all had friends who died... If one of us had it, we all had it.""He later formed Act Up, a radical protest group, and in 1989 learned he was HIV positive himself and suffering from liver damage.He had a liver transplant in 2001 and was given experimental HIV drugs by Anthony Fauci - the medical researcher now leading the fight against the coronavirus in the US.Dr Fauci told the New York Times: ""Once you got past the rhetoric, you found that Larry Kramer made a lot of sense, and that he had a heart of gold.""Kramer's friend and literary executor Will Schwalbe said the playwright's death was not related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Asked by the BBC World Service in 1995 whether it was possible to be both an activist and a writer, Kramer replied: ""Why not? The question that occurs to me all the time is why so few other writers are.""What annoys me so much about England and America is most of the writers are so removed from politics.""",28 May 2020,entertainment
Fraggle Rock to be revived by Apple TV+ after 33 years,"It's time to stream your cares away, and leave your lockdown worries for another day...Because classic children's show Fraggle Rock is to be revived by Apple TV+, 33 years after the last series was made.Gobo, Red, Boober, Mokey, Wembley and Uncle Travelling Matt will reunite for more songs and adventures, to be co-produced by The Jim Henson Company.As well as the new series, every existing episode of the puppet show has just landed on Apple TV+.It's first time Apple TV+ has offered previously produced content.The Emmy-winning Fraggle Rock was devised by late Muppets creator Henson, and first appeared on TV in 1983. It ran for five series, ending in 1987.The new series will follow the recent celeb-filled Fraggle Rock: Rock On! shorts, which debuted on the same platform in April.In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, it showed the cave-dwelling muppets observing social distancing, by living apart and interacting via a video chat system installed by their pudgy green neighbours the Doozers.The likes of actress Tiffany Haddish and singers Alanis Morissette and Ziggy Marley made cameos in the specials, which were made from the homes of various artists and producers using camera phones.A movie version of the show, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has reportedly been in the works for years, but is still yet to see the light of day.Henson's daughter Lisa will executive produce the new series, which will feature on Apple's new roster alongside shows like Helpsters, from the Sesame Workshop, and Snoopy in Space, from Peanuts.",27 May 2020,entertainment

I was honoured to spend time in his orbit.""""Rest in power, King!"" added Ruffalo online.Kramer had made his name as a screenwriter, earning an Oscar nomination in 1971 for adapting DH Lawrence's Women in Love.He also published the best-selling but controversial novel Faggots in 1977.At the start of the 1980s, he put his energies into rallying support and awareness for the fight against HIV and Aids.His other plays included 1992's autobiographical The Destiny of Me.Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda posted that the ""extraordinary writer"" touched the lives of all those who saw his work. ""Thank you, Larry Kramer,"" he wrote.""Larry Kramer changed my core,"" said actress Ellen Barkin, who won a Tony Award in 2011 for her role in a Broadway revival of The Normal Heart.Director and producer Ryan Murphy, who brought the groundbreaking play to the big screen, remembered Kramer as ""the single greatest and most important gay activist of all time"".Kramer first became aware of HIV and Aids after friends living next door in New York died. ""No-one was saying anything,"" he later said.""I often make the comparison with a war reporter whose parachute drops behind enemy lines and he realises he's faced with the greatest story he can tell. I was not a political person before all this.""After a meeting of about 80 people in his apartment in 1982, he helped found Gay Men's Health Crisis and began fundraising, campaigning and writing about the subject.""You should have seen the faces,"" he said of that meeting. ""We all had friends who died... If one of us had it, we all had it.""He later formed Act Up, a radical protest group, and in 1989 learned he was HIV positive himself and suffering from liver damage.He had a liver transplant in 2001 and was given experimental HIV drugs by Anthony Fauci - the medical researcher now leading the fight against the coronavirus in the US.Dr Fauci told the New York Times: ""Once you got past the rhetoric, you found that Larry Kramer made a lot of sense, and that he had a heart of gold.""Kramer's friend and literary executor Will Schwalbe said the playwright's death was not related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Asked by the BBC World Service in 1995 whether it was possible to be both an activist and a writer, Kramer replied: ""Why not? The question that occurs to me all the time is why so few other writers are.""What annoys me so much about England and America is most of the writers are so removed from politics.""",28 May 2020,entertainment
Fraggle Rock to be revived by Apple TV+ after 33 years,"It's time to stream your cares away, and leave your lockdown worries for another day...Because classic children's show Fraggle Rock is to be revived by Apple TV+, 33 years after the last series was made.Gobo, Red, Boober, Mokey, Wembley and Uncle Travelling Matt will reunite for more songs and adventures, to be co-produced by The Jim Henson Company.As well as the new series, every existing episode of the puppet show has just landed on Apple TV+.It's first time Apple TV+ has offered previously produced content.The Emmy-winning Fraggle Rock was devised by late Muppets creator Henson, and first appeared on TV in 1983. It ran for five series, ending in 1987.The new series will follow the recent celeb-filled Fraggle Rock: Rock On! shorts, which debuted on the same platform in April.In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, it showed the cave-dwelling muppets observing social distancing, by living apart and interacting via a video chat system installed by their pudgy green neighbours the Doozers.The likes of actress Tiffany Haddish and singers Alanis Morissette and Ziggy Marley made cameos in the specials, which were made from the homes of various artists and producers using camera phones.A movie version of the show, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has reportedly been in the works for years, but is still yet to see the light of day.Henson's daughter Lisa will executive produce the new series, which will feature on Apple's new roster alongside shows like Helpsters, from the Sesame Workshop, and Snoopy in Space, from Peanuts.",27 May 2020,entertainment
UK film and TV: 'Expect lots of dramas in space or under the sea',"Big changes to working practices in the UK film and TV industry will soon be reflected on our screens, say a leading producer, screenwriter, and union leader.Emmerdale, one of the popular shows which has been stalled since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, started its ""phased return to filming"" this week, adhering to strict new social distancing guidelines on episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown.The new era will pose great ""challenges"", according to Pact union boss John McVay, but he's backing his colleagues to ""creatively rise"" to them, and continue to be ""ambitious"" and ""innovative"" in their approach.""We will have to creatively change what we're doing,"" says McVay, whose organisation represents 550 independent TV, film and creative companies.""If you've got a scene for EastEnders and everyone is in Albert Square celebrating someone's birthday... you couldn't really do that [now]. So these are physical production, business and creative challenges that we're going to have to navigate.""""I would think, looking forward, on soaps you might have a lot more scenes where there isn't a huge party, but maybe a singular storyline about some single parent,"" he adds.While soaps will have to adapt, and current affairs shows have had to muddle through using video conferencing software; bigger-scale productions will be even harder to pull off in the brave new world.Screenwriter and author Ewan Morrison, who has worked on scripts for recent dramas like Netflix's The Outlaw King, as well as Cold Call, and American Blackout, thinks that smart filmmakers should now be thinking about making things that ""won't involve exterior locations and casts of hundreds"".And that TV producers would also be wise to favour shows filmed in ""locked-in and locked down studios"", or in ""remote locations"".""So, expect to see a lot of dramas in the next year that are shot in deep space, under the sea, or in surreal closed environments - like remote islands,"" the RTS Award-winner predicts.""It's ideal for horror films like The Platform, Cube, and Saw.""And, of course, animations can now be done from home, so expect to see a renaissance in big-budget animations"".Also being done from home right now is post-production on series four of The Crown, after filming was safely ""in the bag"" before the crisis, producer Andy Harries tells the BBC.Harries says he's ""not convinced"" though that it will be possible to properly film big television dramas in a socially distanced manner, as they are akin to a military operation.""It's very difficult to put a large film crew together with a large bunch of actors, moving it around locations,"" he says.""It's like moving an army around and you can't move an army around two metres apart for every single person.""The film boss, who acknowledges that British crews are ""anxious to get back to work"", admits he doesn't think filming, as they know it, will be possible again until ""some sort of cure or vaccine is available"".His Left Bank Pictures team are currently working out exactly how to film the screen adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, The Fear Index, which they've already decided will now have to move from Europe to London.The story involves a married couple, which has begged the question, ""how do you get [on-screen] intimacy in the 'new normal' that is plausible?"", Harries adds.""You don't want in a year's time to watch a drama after this is all over and go, 'that's a bit ridiculous, they're not even kissing, they are miles apart!' - it's tricky"".Then there's the even trickier issue of coronavirus insurance, or the current lack there of, which Harries and McVay agree is a major obstacle to production, along with feeding and transporting crews to and from set. A government DCMS spokeswoman told the BBC it was, ""working closely with the screen sector to understand the full extent of concerns about insurance and explore ways they can be effectively addressed"".Most independent production companies, McVay notes, operate with enough savings to sustain themselves for three to six months without work and are therefore ""nervous"" that that money will ""burn out in the end"", particularly in the event of a second spike/lockdown.As a leading contributor to the UK economy, the film and TV industry should be given research and development tax credits, he claims, both for now, and to help them to have world class ""ideas ready for when the market comes back"".""We have some of the best technical crew, the best actors, the best writers, the best directors,"" adds McVay.""All of that is a wonderful happy accident, which somehow has happened in the UK over the past 20-odd years and we don't want to pull back from that as that's been a hard fought-for position.""One such talent, Morrison, is fearful, however, that a move to ""increased statism"" in both politics and in culture-making, in the wake of the virus, will ""cull about half the small TV and film production companies"", and lead to far less bold and original content being made.Cinemas in Japan reopened last week showing classics like Ben-Hur, Wizard of Oz, and Blade Runner, after many filmmakers delayed their latest releases, in response to the crisis, or debuted them online.""Unfortunately, because everyone's finances are now much more endangered and stretched, I can imagine we'll see a lot of conservatism within programme commissioning choice, and very little risk-taking,"" says Morrison.""There's just not any spare money around to take risks, so we'll be seeing even more remakes and safe names.""""We're going to end up with the only two monetisable forms of culture,"" he goes on. ""Corporate-funded Hollywood franchises, and state-funded culture, funded by printed money"".In other words: ""We're going to have Marvel, and the BBC... Super capitalism and super estate.""It's perhaps no surprise that during lockdown, films about fictional viruses like Contagion and novels like Albert Camus' The Plague have become more popular, as people try to get their heads around the current situation.Morrison, whose work - including the recent Scottish fiction book of the year-winner, Nina X - touches on themes of control, freedom, utopia and globalisation; finds it reminiscent of dystopias such as 1984 and Farenheit 451, where ""over-powerful states control language and behaviour"".The much-talked about Chinese social credit score system, and the contact tracing app soon to be rolled out in the UK to help stop the spread, also remind him of the Black Mirror episode Nosedive; set in a world where people rate each other for every interaction they have, which then has an impact on their socio-economic status.On the plus side, he suggests, an extended period in quarantine will have have permitted ""people who are usually working for 'The Man' to be creative for themselves"", leading to potential new crop of British stars, as well as a ""super abundance of free culture"" online.But that phase will be short lived, he envisages, and they won't necessarily be stars of the screen.""Poetry, painting, music, these things will thrive, but art forms that require vast amounts of capital, like film and TV, won't be open to this abundance of new talent"".McVay describes the pandemic as the ""worst experience"" in his 40-odd years in the business, but he's hopeful that new UK-made programmes and films will continue to thrive.He cites BBC Three's recent drama Normal People, which was produced in Ireland by Element Pictures, as an example of ""great content"" that has mattered to people at this difficult time.As well as continuing to bring us news and features about all things virus-related, he hopes the nation's ""resourceful"" content makers will find ways around restrictions and come up with some ""great British comedy and things that aren't about Covid-19"".""Don't write us off,"" he warns. ""I have a lot of confidence in the ingenuity and creativity of the people in the UK.""We want to makes things and we'll find ways to do it.""",24 May 2020,entertainment
The Joe Rogan Experience: Will Gompertz reviews episode #1470 with Elon Musk ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ,"They used to say everybody had a book in them. Then it changed to everybody had a blog in them. Now, everybody has a podcast in them. And that's just where the book-blog-pod should stay in 99.9% of cases. But there are handful of people who have taken to podcasting like Luke Skywalker to a lightsaber and become masters of cyberspace broadcasting. Elizabeth Day has gone from journalist to novelist to prominent media figure with her How To Fail podcast. George The Poet has cut through with his meditative musings, while the footballer Peter Crouch has turned into a surprise comedy star with his laddish tales from the locker-room. In America - where the art of podcasting was honed with shows like Serial, This American Life and Radiolab - the medium has long had a seat at the top table of the entertainment business. As was made evident this week with the announcement that the Swedish streaming service Spotify had paid a huge sum of money - the Wall Street Journal reported the deal could be worth around $100 million (¬£82 million) - for exclusive rights to a Californian-based podcast called The Joe Rogan Experience. Joe Rogan is a famous personality in the US. He first made his name as a stand-up comic, then turned to acting, before hosting a TV show featuring wince-inducing dares, and between all this established himself as a respected mixed martial arts UFC commentator. He started his eponymous podcast in 2009 as a ""mates chatting"" sort of thing, which it basically still is, although some of his mates are now Senators and Harvard professors. Anyway, it works: the show is said to have over 190 million monthly downloads, which is a lot of listeners by any measure (it is also available for free on YouTube, for now).I visited his website to hear what all the fuss was about, and chose episode #1470 from a couple of weeks ago, in which Rogan chats to Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and Tesla car boss. He'd had Musk on the show before, offered him a puff on his joint (cannabis is legal in the state where the show is made), which Elon duly accepted, leading to headlines and a sharp drop in Tesla's share price. The episode I listened to didn't have any such incidents. The two men began by chewing the fat about Musk's newly-born baby, to whom the businessman and his partner had given a name that sounded like a line of code written by one of his company's boffs. Rogan was amused and enthusiastic as the conversation gently meandered towards the topic of connecting computers to our brains, a concept that appeared to enthral and appal the host in equal measure.Not so the quietly-spoken Musk, who considered the prospect of a ""whole brain interface"" where ""more of you would be in the cloud than in your body"", to be viable within decades. Don't worry if that seems like too long to wait, because he also thought if all went to plan, that in five years we won't have to talk anymore because we'll be able to communicate our unfettered thoughts through neural links. These were not small things to posit given the obvious ramifications, particularly for The Joe Rogan Experience: no talking, no podcast. But our host didn't seem concerned or particularly interested in interrogating the breezy claims his guest made with a matter-of-factness that equated to someone putting a live grenade in your hand and mentioning, by-the-by, it could be quite dangerous. That's not to say Rogan was disengaged. It's just that his natural curiosity tended to stop at wow without getting to why. Which is fine, that's the nature of the show: guests are allowed to talk as much and as long as they like, often for hours, with Rogan the interlocutor playing the role of everyman: a part he has nailed better than almost anyone else in the world of podcasts, if one was judging by numbers alone (downloads, YouTube views, Instagram followers etc.).He is, as they say nowadays, relatable. His listeners get him, like him; maybe even want to be him. He's not a show-pony, or a light-entertainment phoney: he's the all-American do it yourself modern man, tough but intelligent. Joe Rogan is the Bruce Springsteen of chat.The Boss has taken his brand global, whether Rogan can repeat the feat in the talk-show genre will be interesting to see. The two men have much in common. They share the same muscular male aesthetic, with a love of T-shirts and no BS. They're both from New Jersey. They both had troubled relationships with their fathers - Springsteen's dad was a bus driver, Rogan's a cop. And they both found fame as the front man on stage.Given the size of its investment, Spotify must be hoping Rogan can compete with Springsteen in terms of reach and appeal. I'm not so sure he can having listened to his show. Songs can be reinterpreted, meaning can morph and be personalised - less so with chat, which tends to be specific to the host and his or her culture. I quite enjoyed listening to his conversation with Musk, but I wouldn't download another show in a rush for entertainment's sake. It wasn't just because the entrepreneur could say almost anything without being challenged - there's a section about Covid-19 when I found my eyebrows rise while Joe's and Elon's were furrowed in agreement (I believe in previous episodes Rogan has been more sceptical). The main problem is my cultural reference points are different, I don't relate to Joe Rogan. I'm not interested in mixed martial arts or conspiracy theories or smoking weed or drinking hard liquor or camping or ""dumb things"". I don't care if a Tesla car can accelerate to 60 mph in under two seconds or want to hear what Elon Musk has to say to ""all the fools out there"" - another throwaway remark that went unchallenged.Nevertheless, the host clearly reflects the views and tastes of a vast number of American people, and has developed a format with which they can connect and hear his thoughts and those of his guests (male-skewed, judging by the recent roster). And that's why I will continue to download his show: Not to be amused but to be informed.  Listen to The Joe Rogan Experience and you hear America.

That's not what I'm talking about.""In the impassioned Instagram live, he then explained: ""There's no way that I have the opinion that there's no other forms of racism. Of course there's other forms of racism.""But a black man was just murdered in cold blood in the street Stateside again, while saying he can't breathe. That's a continuous cycle going on. Although I don't live in the States, I'm black.""Boyega refused to back down, adding: ""I said what I said.""He continued: ""It's not about career, it's not about money, because a lot of people like to bring that up... That's got nothing to do with how you treat people. It's a madness.""So when I say it, I mean it, and you lot can't rattle me. I'm not the guy to be rattled.

What will it take? A civil war? A new president? Violent riots? It's tired! I'm tired!""Bieber posted: ""This makes me absolutely sick. This makes me angry this man DIED. This makes me sad.

BBC Proms hope to include two weeks of live concerts at Royal Albert Hall,"This year's BBC Proms will combine archive recordings and live concerts - with audiences at the Royal Albert Hall if coronavirus restrictions allow.Organisers said the ""ambition"" is for musicians to perform at the London venue for the last two weeks of the two-month classical music festival.It will culminate with a ""poignant and unique"" Last Night of the Proms on 12 September, they said.A virtual ""mash-up"" of Beethoven's nine symphonies will kick off the season. More than 350 musicians will be heard performing together on 17 July after recording their parts at home.Proms director David Pickard said the piece, arranged by Iain Farrington, would involve ""the most ambitious lockdown orchestra ever"".The 2020 season will continue with TV, radio and online broadcasts of past Proms, some chosen by the public.Pickard said he was ""very hopeful"" live concerts would follow at the end of August.Performers, from soloists to ensembles, will be booked nearer the time when social distancing rules for the period become clear.Earlier this month, Katherine Jenkins performed inside the empty Albert Hall for the VE Day 75th anniversary.An audience during the live Proms events has not been ruled out, depending on government advice at the time.Pickard said the Last Night of the Proms would ""look and sound very different"" but would still evoke ""the same elation"" as always.He promised ""a stimulating and enriching musical summer for both loyal Proms audiences and people discovering the riches we have to offer for the first time"".A host of major events, among them this year's Glastonbury music festival, have been cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Pickard said cancelling the Proms this year had been an option but to have done so would have been ""a terrible opportunity missed"".",28 May 2020,entertainment
The High Note: Why Tracee Ellis Ross 'only got better with age',"Usually, when a Hollywood star has a new movie coming out, they fly to London for a publicity blitz.They'll often take part in a press junket, which is where the film company hires out an entire floor of an expensive hotel and invites journalists to come and interview them. It's efficient for the actors, because they can knock off several interviews in one day, and in one place. There's usually a lot of hanging around for the journalists - but if you're lucky you get a free Diet Coke and a biscuit while you're waiting.But just like pub quizzes, office meetings and first dates, promoting a new Hollywood movie has moved online to Zoom - where sadly there are no free snacks.At the the launch of the movie The High Note, journalists are shuffled between different virtual meeting rooms, waiting to speak with the film's star Tracee Ellis Ross.Thanks to lockdown, the actress is launching and promoting the movie entirely from her own living room.""It's wonderful, but I miss people,"" Ross tells BBC News. ""I don't have shoes on, so that's nice! I'm at home, that's nice too. But I wouldn't mind seeing you face-to-face and being in your energy, that always makes a difference. But actually, it is nice to be able to do these things even though we're in a pandemic, and to do them safely.""The High Note tells the story of soul singer Grace Davis (Ross) and her assistant Maggie (Fifty Shades star Dakota Johnson), who is an aspiring music producer herself.Grace (who is not to be confused with the 2017 X Factor runner-up Grace Davies) is in the autumn of her career. A pop star over 40, she is no longer having number one hits and her manager is encouraging her to start a Vegas residency to keep the money coming in. The character isn't based on anyone specific - but there are plenty of singers who have followed the Vegas route in real life, including Britney Spears, Celine Dion and Toni Braxton.The role marks the first time Ross has ever been heard singing. And pressure is high - her mother is Motown legend Diana Ross. ""It was my childhood dream, I always wanted to sing,"" she says. ""I didn't put it away, but I think the longer you wait to do certain things the more frightening they get... The idea of comparison because of who my mom is, or the judgement of doing it now at this age, became bigger than the dream. So when this role came along, I was like, 'it's time'.""Ross is best known in the US for starring in TV series including Girlfriends and Black-ish. Her performance in the latter earned her a Golden Globe Award in 2017 for best TV comedy actress. The High Note marks her first on-screen film role since 2009. She says her successful TV career has been ""incredibly fulfilling"", but adds: ""The truth is it's left me little desire to pursue certain things, because I'm tired and I have a full schedule, but it takes something I'm really excited about and then I'm like 'this is it'.""Ross says she was drawn to the message of the story - which she characterises as being about two women, each pursuing their own dream regardless of what others want from them.Notably, the two women are ""not against each other"", as Ross puts it. ""The dynamic that both of us developed was not the characteristic stereotypical schtick between diva and assistant. We were able to find this real friendship connection that was in there, that kind of gave it the right tone.""Flora Greeson's screenplay makes much of Grace's age. One scene sees Grace point to how few singers over 40 still score number one hits, especially female artists.A frustration with ageism is one thing Ross shares with her character. ""What I know is I have only gotten better with age,"" she says. ""I think I'm the sexiest I've ever been, and I'm almost 50. And I think of the other women who are in this age bracket and beyond, and I think, 'why was there ever a message of counting us out?' That seems absurd. ""You think of Jennifer Lopez, Marisa Tomei, the list goes on of extraordinary women, and there's so much to offer at this age. My mom on stage now at 76 is like, I think she's better than she's ever been!""For Ross herself, being in her 40s hasn't stopped her from experiencing the most successful decade of her career.""I don't think youth is everything, I just don't,"" Ross says. ""That wonderful expression 'youth is wasted on the young' is great. I mean there are so many good things about youth, but I don't wanna go back, I'll tell you that right now - I wouldn't go back to my 20s if you paid me.""Early reviews of The High Note - which is directed by Nisha Ganatra - have been largely positive, albeit not glowing. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the film ""does have much to recommend it, at least during these lean times"".""It's the kind of plush, pleasurable comfort viewing that goes down as easily as a favourite artist's hits compilation,"" he added.The Daily Mirror's Lewis Knight said: ""Ultimately, it's a credit to the lead actresses of The High Note that it remains so watchable despite being rather formulaic and containing some predictable plot turns and twists.""The film is one of several which had originally been due to open in cinemas this spring. Most of the others - including Mulan, Fast & Furious 9 and No Time To Die - postponed their release until later in the year, in the hope cinemas will be open again.But some studios have instead decided to release their films online for movie fans to rent at home. Trolls World Tour was the first major film out of the gate to do this, and now The High Note is skipping cinemas too.""I'm actually kind of excited,"" Ross says. ""Don't get me wrong, I wanted to see myself on the big screen as Grace Davis, but I have a pretty big TV screen! I feel like there's something really wonderful and intimate about being able to meet people where they are, in their homes.""I can only speak for myself, and right now I don't know that I wanna go and sit in a movie theatre. That doesn't sound like something I wanna do, I'm happy to watch a movie, right here, on the couch!""Audience trepidation about returning to crowded spaces after the coronavirus pandemic could spell serious financial trouble for cinemas, which are already struggling with the loss of income under lockdown. The industry's future is uncertain, to put it mildly. ""I think normal is going to be reshaped for all of us,"" Ross acknowledges, ""so we can respond to the reality of what we're living in and still have joyful experiences and still receive entertainment and expand our lives by watching these stories in a way that matches the reality of where we are.""The High Note is available to rent from Friday 29 May from digital retailers.",28 May 2020,entertainment
