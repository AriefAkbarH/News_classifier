The Electron mission was lost about six minutes after leaving Mahia Peninsula
The American launch company that flies its rockets out of New Zealand has lost its latest mission.

Rocket Lab said its Electron vehicle failed late in its ascent from Mahia Peninsula on North Island.

All satellite payloads are assumed to have been destroyed.

These included imaging spacecraft from Canon Electronics of Japan and Planet Labs Inc of California, as well as a technology demonstration platform from a UK start-up called In-Space Missions.

Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck apologised to his customers.

"I am incredibly sorry that we failed to deliver our customers' satellites today. Rest assured we will find the issue, correct it and be back on the pad soon," he said on Twitter.

Rocket Lab has made everyone in the space sector sit up since it debuted its Electron vehicle in 2017. It's at the head of a wave of new outfits that want to operate compact rockets to service the emerging market for small satellites.

Saturday's lift-off from New Zealand was the Electron's 13th outing to date. All prior launches had been a complete success, bar the very first which failed to reach its intended orbit.
