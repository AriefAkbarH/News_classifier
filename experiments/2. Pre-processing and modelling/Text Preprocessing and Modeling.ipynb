They are keen to hear recordings of dawn choruses, animals in unusual places, and views of the night sky without pollution. The Earth Project is a global citizen science study co-ordinated by scientists across UK universities.It hopes to showcase how nature has capitalised on reduced human activity during the pandemic. The researchers want the public to help them capture a global representation of what we experienced on the ground during lockdown.\"We are hoping to create a useful shared library of baseline experiences for the public, reminding us in the future of what life and our relationship with nature could be when global public mobility and many pollution-generating activities are reduced,\" explained Phil Manning from the University of Manchester.The team acknowledges that \"significant sacrifices\" will have to be made by everyone in order to reduce our impact on the planet's climate system, and to move towards the sustainable use of the Earth's natural resources. It is hoped that the positive experiences many people had with nature during lockdown, and the recollection of those experiences, will help build the case for behaviour changes to help shift us towards sustainability.During the lockdown, wildlife reclaiming the streets of towns and cities during lockdown have made headlines around the world. For example, goats that normally keep themselves to themselves in the hills surrounding Llandudno, Wales, ventured into the town's deserted streets.People have also reported that they have been able to hear birdsong more clearly without the constant hum of traffic.The submissions will be collated by the Earth Project team, which consists of concerned citizens alongside scientists from multiple UK universities, including Bangor, Belfast, Durham, Manchester and Plymouth.Prof Manning told BBC News that the recordings of birdsong, night skies and nature calls will be made available online for everyone to enjoy and to relive the better moments of life under lockdown.\"The survey results will help provide an overview of people's observations and thoughts on the environment before, during and after lockdown,\" he observed.\"The responses will be analysed and summarised and then made available along with the database on our website during the late Summer and Autumn of 2020.\"He said that it was hoped that the findings of the survey could encourage behaviour change and help shape policies and strategies that could deliver greener and sustainable lifestyles.\"The Earth Project… has the potential to provide a snapshot of what happened to the environment and wildlife when human activity is drastically reduced or simply managed in a more sustainable way,\" Prof Manning said.As part of the project's survey, it will ask people whether they are willing to make changes to their behaviour to help improve the world around them.Prof Manning added: \"This information will be evaluated in our inclusive Earth Project think-tank and, hopefully, this could impact future behaviour and guide those who make policy decisions.\"The Earth Project has the potential to help catalyse humankind to a sustainable future.\"You can access the Earth Project -Live website here.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A clear picture is emerging of why the asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago was so catastrophic.The space object, which wiped out 75% of all species including the dinosaurs, hit the worst possible place on the planet and - according to new research - at the most lethal angle.Investigations at the crater site, together with computer simulations, suggest the impactor dug into the crust at an inclination of up to 60 degrees.This exacerbated the climatic fallout.We know that the target rocks, in what is now the Gulf of Mexico, contained huge volumes of sulphur from the mineral gypsum. When this material was thrown high into the atmosphere and mixed with water vapour, it produced a \"global winter\".And the angle of attack ensured this environmental crisis was intense and prolonged.   \"At 45 to 60 degrees, the impact is very efficient at vaporising and ejecting debris to high altitude. If the impact happens at shallower or much steeper angles, the amount of material that's put into the atmosphere that can then have climate-changing effects is significantly less,\" explained Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London. \"It's evident that the nature of the location where this event happened, together with the impact angle, made for a perfect storm,\" he told BBC News.The majority of plant and animal life on Earth succumbed to the the challenging conditions.Prof Collins' and colleagues' work is published in the journal Nature Communications.Prof Collins is part of an international team that's been studying the anatomy of the crater associated with the calamitous asteroid strike. Today, this 200km-wide structure is positioned under Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, with its best preserved central portions sitting just offshore of the port of Chicxulub.It's hard to grasp the scale of the forces that produced it.The impactor, thought to be about 12km in diameter, punched an instantaneous hole in the crust that was probably some 30km deep. As fluidised rocks at the base of this bowl rebounded, they created in just a few minutes a mountain that was higher than Everest. This didn't last, however, and it fell back, to leave a prominent inner ring of hills, or peaks.What's interesting from Prof Collins' perspective is the asymmetry that was frozen into the Chicxulub structure.For example, if you look at the centres of the crater, of its peak ring and of the uplifted rock that underlies the crust in Earth's mantle - these points do not map directly on top of each other. They're actually aligned in a northeast-southwest direction, with the crater centre in between the centres of mantle uplift and peak-ring formation.This is a vital clue in determining not only the direction from which the asteroid arrived but the angle at which it hit the planet.The Imperial researcher ran a number of simulations on the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) DiRAC High Performance Computing Facility. The only way he can reproduce the geometry is by having the asteroid come in from the northeast and strike the Earth at an angle of roughly 60 degrees.Prof Collins said: \"If you run the model at different impact angles, at 30 degrees and at 45 degrees, say, you can't match the observations - you get centres of mantle uplift and of the peak ring on the downrange side of the crater centre. And for a straight overhead impact, at 90 degrees, the centres are all on top of each other. So, that's doesn't match the observations, either.\"Imperial colleague and co-author Prof Joanna Morgan added: \"Knowing the direction of impact means we now know which part of the target site was subjected to the greatest shock pressures. \"The sulphur-bearing and carbon-bearing sedimentary rocks actually thicken as you go from east to west, and to the south. So this result means we're degassing more of those sediments than we would if you just took an average value for their thickness.\"And Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US, told BBC News: \"This new modelling provides a clear answer to the angle of the impact and the direction of the impact that largely settles a long-standing debate on what was downrange of the impact.  \"Also critical is that a 60-degree angle is in the range of the worst options for injecting large volumes of vaporised and ejected sulphur-rich rocks into the atmosphere.  \"Thus these results are critical for understanding potential 'kill mechanisms',\" the co-author explained.Gulick and Morgan led the expedition that drilled into the Chicxulub Crater in 2016 to recover some of its rocks for an analysis. A follow-up, high-resolution seismic survey is due to take place late this summer that will provide an enhanced 3D view of the structure.The impact that changed life on EarthJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos</td>\n",

       "      <td>Global sport faces major disruption from climate change in coming decades, according to a new analysis.By 2050, it's estimated that almost one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year. But tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says. The study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously.While the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot.Extreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years. A typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there. Smoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year. These and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new study compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt.As football slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050.In the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat.Cricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies.Venues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade. In golf, one in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says. Winter sports also face an uncertain future. Researchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050.But as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions. The author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country like Bolivia at the low end but as large as a country like Spain on the high end.The estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate.Whatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author. \"Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,\" said David Goldblatt.\"Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,\" he said.While some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050, the majority of sports authorities have not. The International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up. Among winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, \"which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,\" the report waspishly notes. The report was commissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance, a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change. \"A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,\" said Andrew Simms from the group.\"If players also speak out and say they believe clean air and a stable climate matter, millions more will see the possibilities for change.  It will not only send a message of hope for the wider world, but it will help to guarantee a planet that is safe for sport.\"Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Human impacts on the places on Earth with the most richness of life have brought hundreds of wild animals to the brink of extinction, a study shows.The likes of logging and poaching have pushed 500 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians to the point where they're hanging by a thread, research found.This is yet more evidence that the world's undergoing a sixth mass extinction, scientists argue.Species are disappearing at more than 100 times the natural rate, they say. And unlike other mass extinctions, caused by volcano eruptions or asteroid collisions, we only have ourselves to blame.Prof Gerardo Ceballos of the National University of Mexico in Mexico City, said regional ecosystems are facing collapse. \"We have entered the sixth mass extinction,\" he told BBC News. \"Based on our research and what we're seeing, the extinction crisis is so bad that whatever we do in the next 10 to 50 years is what will define the future of humanity.\"Prof Ceballos worked on the study with two other well-known conservation scientists, Stanford University's Prof Paul Erhlich, and Dr Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St Louis, US.Using data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened species and Birdlife (the bird authority for the IUCN), they identified at least 515 species that are on the brink of extinction, with fewer than a thousand individuals left. The animals are found on every continent save Antarctica, in places highly impacted by humans, primarily in the tropics and subtropics.They include the Golden Lion Tamarin, Ethiopian Wolf, Javan Rhinoceros, Spanish Imperial Eagle, Yellow-eared Parrot, Gharial and Green Poison Frog.The scientists describe the extinction crisis as an existential threat to civilisation, along with climate change and pollution, to which it is tied.And they say they have a \"moral imperative\" to draw attention to the loss of biodiversity, which they say is still rather ignored by most people.The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Commenting, Prof Diana Fisher of the University of Queensland, Australia, said the study deserved attention because so many people don't realise how much of the world's wildlife faces impending extinction. \"I agree with the authors that this extinction crisis needs to be elevated to an emergency equal to climate change,\" she said.Prof Chris Johnson of the University of Tasmania said the current rate of extinction of species is higher than at any time since 66 million years ago, when the collision of a space-rock with the Earth killed off dinosaurs and many other species. \"Threats to species in today's world - things like habitat destruction and climate change - are growing rapidly,\" he said, adding that the 515 species down to 1,000 or fewer individuals are likely to be gone very soon.  And Prof Euan Ritchie of Deakin University in Australia said the study \"is yet more dire confirmation that we are destroying life at a horrific pace and scale\".Follow Helen on Twitter.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Conservation groups have welcomed China's move to remove pangolins from the official list of traditional Chinese medicine treatments, saying this could be a \"game changer\".The news, reported by China's Health Times newspaper, comes after China raised the animal's protected status to the highest level last week.Pangolins have been pushed to the brink by illegal hunting for scales and meat.They are implicated in coronavirus, but the evidence is unclear.Conservation charities have welcomed the move to remove them from the official list of traditional Chinese medicines. Paul Thomson of Save Pangolins said it was a breakthrough moment. \"China's move to phase out pangolin scales from traditional medicines could be the game changer we have been waiting for,\" he said. \"We hope China's next move will be to enforce the regulations and work to change consumer behaviour.\"And Katheryn Wise of animal welfare campaign group, World Animal Protection, said it was \"great news\" that China had upgraded pangolins to the highest level of protection and removed them from the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.She called for this to be extended to all wild animals, \"who, like pangolins, are poached from the wild and often placed in squalid, cramped cages, creating a lethal hotbed of disease\".Pangolins are covered with a layer of scales, which are designed to protect them against predators. The scales are highly coveted by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, while pangolin meat is seen as a delicacy. China banned the consumption of live wild animals for food in the wake of the outbreak, but there are certain exemptions, such as for medicine or fur.Pangolins are in the spotlight as a possible animal host for coronavirus, but no direct link has been shown.Nicole Benjamin-Fink of Conservation Beyond Borders said that, whether pangolins served as the conduit for the coronavirus or not, it's time to halt the demand for the most trafficked mammals worldwide. \"Let's hope that this ban is the first in a series that ultimately ban all wildlife usage in traditional Chinese medicine,\" she said.Pangolins eat ants and other insects, and are often known as the scaly anteater.

They are keen to hear recordings of dawn choruses, animals in unusual places, and views of the night sky without pollution. The Earth Project is a global citizen science study co-ordinated by scientists across UK universities.It hopes to showcase how nature has capitalised on reduced human activity during the pandemic. The researchers want the public to help them capture a global representation of what we experienced on the ground during lockdown.\"We are hoping to create a useful shared library of baseline experiences for the public, reminding us in the future of what life and our relationship with nature could be when global public mobility and many pollution-generating activities are reduced,\" explained Phil Manning from the University of Manchester.The team acknowledges that \"significant sacrifices\" will have to be made by everyone in order to reduce our impact on the planet's climate system, and to move towards the sustainable use of the Earth's natural resources. It is hoped that the positive experiences many people had with nature during lockdown, and the recollection of those experiences, will help build the case for behaviour changes to help shift us towards sustainability.During the lockdown, wildlife reclaiming the streets of towns and cities during lockdown have made headlines around the world. For example, goats that normally keep themselves to themselves in the hills surrounding Llandudno, Wales, ventured into the town's deserted streets.People have also reported that they have been able to hear birdsong more clearly without the constant hum of traffic.The submissions will be collated by the Earth Project team, which consists of concerned citizens alongside scientists from multiple UK universities, including Bangor, Belfast, Durham, Manchester and Plymouth.Prof Manning told BBC News that the recordings of birdsong, night skies and nature calls will be made available online for everyone to enjoy and to relive the better moments of life under lockdown.\"The survey results will help provide an overview of people's observations and thoughts on the environment before, during and after lockdown,\" he observed.\"The responses will be analysed and summarised and then made available along with the database on our website during the late Summer and Autumn of 2020.\"He said that it was hoped that the findings of the survey could encourage behaviour change and help shape policies and strategies that could deliver greener and sustainable lifestyles.\"The Earth Project… has the potential to provide a snapshot of what happened to the environment and wildlife when human activity is drastically reduced or simply managed in a more sustainable way,\" Prof Manning said.As part of the project's survey, it will ask people whether they are willing to make changes to their behaviour to help improve the world around them.Prof Manning added: \"This information will be evaluated in our inclusive Earth Project think-tank and, hopefully, this could impact future behaviour and guide those who make policy decisions.\"The Earth Project has the potential to help catalyse humankind to a sustainable future.\"You can access the Earth Project -Live website here.  science\n",
       "291  A clear picture is emerging of why the asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago was so catastrophic.The space object, which wiped out 75% of all species including the dinosaurs, hit the worst possible place on the planet and - according to new research - at the most lethal angle.Investigations at the crater site, together with computer simulations, suggest the impactor dug into the crust at an inclination of up to 60 degrees.This exacerbated the climatic fallout.We know that the target rocks, in what is now the Gulf of Mexico, contained huge volumes of sulphur from the mineral gypsum. When this material was thrown high into the atmosphere and mixed with water vapour, it produced a \"global winter\".And the angle of attack ensured this environmental crisis was intense and prolonged.   \"At 45 to 60 degrees, the impact is very efficient at vaporising and ejecting debris to high altitude. If the impact happens at shallower or much steeper angles, the amount of material that's put into the atmosphere that can then have climate-changing effects is significantly less,\" explained Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London. \"It's evident that the nature of the location where this event happened, together with the impact angle, made for a perfect storm,\" he told BBC News.The majority of plant and animal life on Earth succumbed to the the challenging conditions.Prof Collins' and colleagues' work is published in the journal Nature Communications.Prof Collins is part of an international team that's been studying the anatomy of the crater associated with the calamitous asteroid strike. Today, this 200km-wide structure is positioned under Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, with its best preserved central portions sitting just offshore of the port of Chicxulub.It's hard to grasp the scale of the forces that produced it.The impactor, thought to be about 12km in diameter, punched an instantaneous hole in the crust that was probably some 30km deep. As fluidised rocks at the base of this bowl rebounded, they created in just a few minutes a mountain that was higher than Everest. This didn't last, however, and it fell back, to leave a prominent inner ring of hills, or peaks.What's interesting from Prof Collins' perspective is the asymmetry that was frozen into the Chicxulub structure.For example, if you look at the centres of the crater, of its peak ring and of the uplifted rock that underlies the crust in Earth's mantle - these points do not map directly on top of each other. They're actually aligned in a northeast-southwest direction, with the crater centre in between the centres of mantle uplift and peak-ring formation.This is a vital clue in determining not only the direction from which the asteroid arrived but the angle at which it hit the planet.The Imperial researcher ran a number of simulations on the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) DiRAC High Performance Computing Facility. The only way he can reproduce the geometry is by having the asteroid come in from the northeast and strike the Earth at an angle of roughly 60 degrees.Prof Collins said: \"If you run the model at different impact angles, at 30 degrees and at 45 degrees, say, you can't match the observations - you get centres of mantle uplift and of the peak ring on the downrange side of the crater centre. And for a straight overhead impact, at 90 degrees, the centres are all on top of each other. So, that's doesn't match the observations, either.\"Imperial colleague and co-author Prof Joanna Morgan added: \"Knowing the direction of impact means we now know which part of the target site was subjected to the greatest shock pressures. \"The sulphur-bearing and carbon-bearing sedimentary rocks actually thicken as you go from east to west, and to the south. So this result means we're degassing more of those sediments than we would if you just took an average value for their thickness.\"And Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US, told BBC News: \"This new modelling provides a clear answer to the angle of the impact and the direction of the impact that largely settles a long-standing debate on what was downrange of the impact.  \"Also critical is that a 60-degree angle is in the range of the worst options for injecting large volumes of vaporised and ejected sulphur-rich rocks into the atmosphere.  \"Thus these results are critical for understanding potential 'kill mechanisms',\" the co-author explained.Gulick and Morgan led the expedition that drilled into the Chicxulub Crater in 2016 to recover some of its rocks for an analysis. A follow-up, high-resolution seismic survey is due to take place late this summer that will provide an enhanced 3D view of the structure.The impact that changed life on EarthJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos  science\n",

But tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says. The study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously.While the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot.Extreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years. A typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there. Smoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year. These and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new study compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt.As football slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050.In the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat.Cricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies.Venues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade. In golf, one in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says. Winter sports also face an uncertain future. Researchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050.But as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions. The author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country like Bolivia at the low end but as large as a country like Spain on the high end.The estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate.Whatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author. \"Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,\" said David Goldblatt.\"Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,\" he said.While some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050, the majority of sports authorities have not. The International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up. Among winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, \"which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,\" the report waspishly notes. The report was commissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance, a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change. \"A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,\" said Andrew Simms from the group.\"If players also speak out and say they believe clean air and a stable climate matter, millions more will see the possibilities for change.  It will not only send a message of hope for the wider world, but it will help to guarantee a planet that is safe for sport.\"Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.  science\n",

And unlike other mass extinctions, caused by volcano eruptions or asteroid collisions, we only have ourselves to blame.Prof Gerardo Ceballos of the National University of Mexico in Mexico City, said regional ecosystems are facing collapse. \"We have entered the sixth mass extinction,\" he told BBC News. \"Based on our research and what we're seeing, the extinction crisis is so bad that whatever we do in the next 10 to 50 years is what will define the future of humanity.\"Prof Ceballos worked on the study with two other well-known conservation scientists, Stanford University's Prof Paul Erhlich, and Dr Peter Raven of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St Louis, US.Using data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened species and Birdlife (the bird authority for the IUCN), they identified at least 515 species that are on the brink of extinction, with fewer than a thousand individuals left. The animals are found on every continent save Antarctica, in places highly impacted by humans, primarily in the tropics and subtropics.They include the Golden Lion Tamarin, Ethiopian Wolf, Javan Rhinoceros, Spanish Imperial Eagle, Yellow-eared Parrot, Gharial and Green Poison Frog.The scientists describe the extinction crisis as an existential threat to civilisation, along with climate change and pollution, to which it is tied.And they say they have a \"moral imperative\" to draw attention to the loss of biodiversity, which they say is still rather ignored by most people.The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Commenting, Prof Diana Fisher of the University of Queensland, Australia, said the study deserved attention because so many people don't realise how much of the world's wildlife faces impending extinction. \"I agree with the authors that this extinction crisis needs to be elevated to an emergency equal to climate change,\" she said.Prof Chris Johnson of the University of Tasmania said the current rate of extinction of species is higher than at any time since 66 million years ago, when the collision of a space-rock with the Earth killed off dinosaurs and many other species. \"Threats to species in today's world - things like habitat destruction and climate change - are growing rapidly,\" he said, adding that the 515 species down to 1,000 or fewer individuals are likely to be gone very soon.  And Prof Euan Ritchie of Deakin University in Australia said the study \"is yet more dire confirmation that we are destroying life at a horrific pace and scale\".Follow Helen on Twitter.  science\n",

Paul Thomson of Save Pangolins said it was a breakthrough moment. \"China's move to phase out pangolin scales from traditional medicines could be the game changer we have been waiting for,\" he said. \"We hope China's next move will be to enforce the regulations and work to change consumer behaviour.\"And Katheryn Wise of animal welfare campaign group, World Animal Protection, said it was \"great news\" that China had upgraded pangolins to the highest level of protection and removed them from the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.She called for this to be extended to all wild animals, \"who, like pangolins, are poached from the wild and often placed in squalid, cramped cages, creating a lethal hotbed of disease\".Pangolins are covered with a layer of scales, which are designed to protect them against predators. The scales are highly coveted by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, while pangolin meat is seen as a delicacy. China banned the consumption of live wild animals for food in the wake of the outbreak, but there are certain exemptions, such as for medicine or fur.Pangolins are in the spotlight as a possible animal host for coronavirus, but no direct link has been shown.Nicole Benjamin-Fink of Conservation Beyond Borders said that, whether pangolins served as the conduit for the coronavirus or not, it's time to halt the demand for the most trafficked mammals worldwide. \"Let's hope that this ban is the first in a series that ultimately ban all wildlife usage in traditional Chinese medicine,\" she said.Pangolins eat ants and other insects, and are often known as the scaly anteater. All eight species are protected under international law, but trade has been growing.Follow Helen on Twitter.  science"

       "      <td>Foreign visitors to Spain will no longer have to undergo a two-week quarantine from 1 July, the government has announced.It said the measure had been finalised in a cabinet meeting on Monday.Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya had previously said the requirement would be lifted in July, without giving a date.The news comes as the UK government prepares to bring in its own 14-day quarantine policy from 8 June.Travel firms and other industry bodies say the UK should relax the measure for visitors arriving from countries where people are at a lower risk of contracting the coronavirus.Spain normally attracts 80 million tourists a year, with the sector providing more than 12% of the country's GDP.Opening up the holiday market again before the summer season is over is seen as crucial to the Spanish economy. But under the UK's new policy, any tourists returning home after taking holidays in Spain and most other foreign destinations would have to spend two weeks in self-isolation.Several airlines including EasyJet, Jet2 and Ryanair have announced that they plan to resume flights and holidays soon.Easyjet will be resuming flights from 22 airports across Europe from 15 June, as well as regional flights across the UK. But there will only be one international flight from the UK - from Gatwick to Nice in France. Jet2 is planning to resume full services from 1 July, and will fly to several Spanish and Italian destinations, before opening up to Greece and Croatia later in the year.And Ryanair will be restoring 40% of its flights from 1 July and will resume flights from most of the 80 airports it flies from across Europe. Business groups wrote to Boris Johnson on Sunday saying the quarantine would have \"serious consequences\" for the economy and calling for \"air bridge\" deals to be struck with other nations.In their letter to the prime minister, bosses of airlines EasyJet, Tui, Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic, as well as industry bodies Airlines UK, the British Chambers of Commerce, UK Hospitality and manufacturing association Made UK said they had \"serious reservations\" about a \"blanket approach\" to all arrivals into Britain.Instead, they are asking for a more \"targeted, risk-based\" approach when establishing air links with countries that have high infection rates from the pandemic. \"The alternative risks major damage to the arteries of UK trade with key industry supply chains, whilst pushing the UK to the back of the queue as states begin conversations for opening up their borders,\" says the letter.</td>\n",

The 195-year-old firm said it had to make \"some difficult decisions\" to re-energise the business, which has seen sales fall over the past year.The jobs will go over the next 18 months, said Clarks, adding that it was part of a wider plan to turn around the firm which will create 200 new jobs.The firm, which cut 170 jobs last year, employs 13,000 people globally.\"There are exciting opportunities ahead for our business, and we are having to make some difficult decisions to get there,\" said chief executive Giorgio Presca. \"We thank all affected staff for their contribution to our business and they leave their roles with our heartfelt respect and support.\"Clarks shut all of its stores in the UK and Ireland during the coronavirus lockdown, and said it will only reopen them \"when it is right and safe to do so\".It has already opened stores in countries including China as restrictions have been lifted, it added.The firm is consulting with its advisers on funding options for the future, it said, without giving further details.The company posted a £84.4m loss last year as sales dropped. It sold 20 million pairs of shoes in the year to February 2019, two million fewer than the year before, citing \"extremely tough\" conditions on the high street.It also said it will close some of its worst-performing stores.Last year it closed its only remaining UK factory after it failed to hit its targets for making desert boots. The factory opened in 2017.The company started making shoes in the UK in 1825 but production was moved to the Far East in 2005.Prior to that, the last remaining Clarks plant in the UK - Millom in Cumbria - closed in 2006.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Clothes stores are ramping up plans to reopen - and big discounts could be on offer.Some non-essential retailers will be able to begin reopening next month.One of the UK's biggest fashion retailers, M&amp;S, said: \"We are working towards reopening more space from June.\" But analyst Richard Lin of Retail Economics said stores \"will have to discount heavily\" to sell excess stock that may now be out of season.\"Many clothing retailers have been sitting there with stores full of stock which they haven't be able to shift,\" he said.\"One of the most pressing issues for retailers is working capital and there is a huge overhang of inventory at fashion stores.\"Fashion retailers have been badly hit by the coronavirus crisis. Even those with robust online offerings have reported huge drops in sales.Next, for instance, saw online sales decline by 32% in the three months to the end of April. Like others, it is keen to re-open stores, as soon as it is deemed safe to do so.Next said: \"We have plans in place for the re-purposing of our stores ready to reopen in a socially-distanced world.\"Its measures include installing screens at tills, placing sanitisation stations in stores and managing the number of customers that are allowed to enter its shops.M&amp;S has kept its food stores open during the crisis, including almost 300 shops that sell fashion as well, although these areas have been blocked off.But it says they're ready to be reopened as soon as the government gives it the green light.\"Our 290 stores that sell both clothing and food are led by a single manager - so it means they already have a brilliant working knowledge of the necessary hygiene measures, how to manage social distancing and the flow of our customers in and out of their store,\" M&amp;S said.Last week the government said its strategy was to \"open non-essential retail when and where it is safe to do so\", and subject to those retailers being able to follow new guidelines.It said the intention was for this to happen in phases from 1 June, although it added that it would issue further guidance on which businesses will be allowed to open and when.That guidance can't come soon enough, according to Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC).\"Retailers desperately need clarity in the rules regarding when and how they can open - details that are still lacking,\" she said.She warned that safety must be the primary concern in the decisions, rather than size or type of shop. The retail experience is going to be turned on its head when clothes stores reopen,\" predicted Mr Lin from Retail Economics.\"Retailers are having to reinterpret government guidelines and have to invest heavily to make sure they can create a safe environment.\"He said consumers will remain incredibly anxious and cautious about returning to fashion retailers.Changing rooms are expected to remain closed while customers will be encouraged to avoid touching merchandise.\"Staff will potentially have to walk around spraying shelves,\" Mr Lin said.There are likely to be one-way systems through stores with clear floor markings and signage, while customer entry will be limited and consumers will be encouraged to shop alone.Next said it will \"prioritise the opening of our larger out-of-town stores first\".Their bigger size makes them easier to adapt and they have large car parks and outside spaces to manage queues, it said.\"Retailers have started to plan how they can open stores and follow safety guidelines, with some hinting at sales when they do open their doors, such as Next,\" said Dan Plant, savings expert at UKHotDeals.\"Other popular stores, like Primark, lack online sales space, so we'd expect to see plenty of fashion offers when retailers reopen.\"But while fashion stores may reopen with deep discounts to clear old stock, most online retailers have already been offering sales to encourage shoppers.M&amp;S, for instance, launched its \"rainbow sale\" on Friday with up to 50% off and 10% of takings going to NHS charities.Boohoo, Fat Face, French Connection, Gap, JD Sports , Next, Superdry and Topshop have offered similar 50%-off deals.The likes of Asos, Clarks, Dune, Debenhams, John Lewis, Karen Millen, New Look, Office and Quiz have also been offering cut-price deals.</td>\n",

       "      <td>MPs are to grill health officials on whether they overpaid for personal protective equipment to deal with coronavirus.The MP leading the inquiry says the crisis should not be an excuse for failing to achieve value for money.One focus of their interest could be a little-known pest control company which won a contract to supply PPE worth more than £100m.The government says it wants firms that can quickly provide a lot of PPE.PestFix, part of a company called Crisp Websites, signed the £109m contract with the government on 13 April to supply what were specified as \"urgently needed gloves, gowns and masks to the NHS supply chain.\"The business operates from a unit by Littlehampton Marina on the West Sussex coast. Its accounts show that last year it had net assets of just £18,000.Yet officials sealed the deal with PestFix without putting the order out to other suppliers in a competitive tendering process, saying in the contract that because it was a matter of \"extreme urgency\" they were able to place the order \"without competing or advertising the requirement\".PestFix says it has delivered more than 67 million items of PPE into the NHS Supply Chain.\"Our small, dedicated global team, spanning three continents, has worked non-stop for the past 70 days to support efforts of getting PPE to the front line involving an ongoing and herculean logistics operation,\" its director, Dan England, told BBC News.But the contract has added to concerns that in the scramble to get hold of vital equipment as the coronavirus situation deteriorated, the government may have paid too much.Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, would not comment on particular cases before taking evidence on Monday.But she said: \"Just getting numbers on its own isn't enough. You need to get value for money for the taxpayer, even in difficult times.\"A hundred public sector contracts worth £342m had been signed for Covid-related PPE by the end of last month, according to the specialist data firm, Tussell.So nearly a third by value was accounted for by the single order to PestFix.One of the UK's most senior civil servants, the permanent secretary of the Cabinet Office, Alex Chisholm, told the committee last week that is was difficult to make value for money assessments in the current situation.\"You'll find for PPE, ventilators and lots of other things we've purchased, that the per unit cost of buying things at great speed from multiple sources in a sellers' market has been higher than we would like to have paid,\" Mr Chisholm said.\"So if you compared the average cost a year ago to what we've been paying now, it's been expensive\".But he said the spending was necessary and there was no alternative.The procurement process has been fraught with problems.A shipment in early May of more than 80 tonnes of protective gowns from Turkey was first delayed and then rejected by inspectors as faulty.Meg Hillier is incensed by the Turkish episode, saying \"We should not be paying money for old rope.\"But small businesses say they have been doing their best to help in the country's hour of need.The next biggest contract for PPE, after PestFix, was granted to a marine supplies company near Salisbury, Ocean Footprint, which had been buying protective masks from China to sell to boatyards.Ocean Footprint agreed to supply the NHS with three million high grade masks for £5m. In the next few days it will have delivered more than a million of them.\"I'm open about what we've done,\" says the managing director Peter Harrison, adding that it is easy to forget how anxious a time it was for health officials and suppliers as the deals were being struck.\"It was desperate. It was all hands on deck. We hadn't even reached the peak.\"The company knew that getting hold of enough masks in rivalry with other countries would be impossible, so it invested £100,000 in its own mask-making machine in order to be able to complete the order.The NHS could have bought similar masks much more cheaply before the crisis, Mr Harrison admits, but he says frantic worldwide demand, rising raw material costs and the need for air transport have sent prices spiralling upwards.He says that at the price he is selling to the government he could offload his entire stock to other buyers in a day.A not-for-profit campaign group, The Good Law Project, has announced that it will seek a judicial review of the decision to award PestFix with its PPE contract.The review would be to find out why there was no competition for the order and how the company was chosen.Dan England from PestFix says: \"We continue to work in close partnership with the NHS, MOD Procurement and DHSC Covid-19 procurement teams, who have all demonstrated incredible dedication in supporting PestFix to deliver this highly complex transaction.\"A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"During this unprecedented global pandemic, we have been working around the clock to ensure PPE is delivered as quickly as possible to those on the frontline and we have delivered more than 1.7 billion items since the outbreak began.\"We are prioritising companies that can provide large volumes of PPE at a fast pace, while ensuring all new PPE undergoes vigorous checks to ensure they meet the safety and quality required. We are grateful for all offers - some will be rejected based on these standards.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Organised criminals will be exploiting loneliness during lockdown to take money from romance scam victims, a charity has said.Victim Support said people's increased confidence in using the internet to meet and talk leaves them vulnerable.Research in one region shows romance scam victims are groomed, then tricked out of an average of £47,000.One has spoken of how her \"heart ruled my head\" when sending money to the man she thought she loved.Mary, not her real name, was already in the fraudsters' grip before the coronavirus outbreak.But, as the virus started to spread, she believed he was in a country heavily affected, giving him the opportunity to trick more money out of her.She was also feeling the kind of loneliness common among many vulnerable people during the current crisis. The 62-year-old, who is a widow, met \"Arnold\" after using a dating site for the very first time.She said they spoke morning, noon and night for five months about a shared love of music and family.But the man she thought was an American living overseas was, in fact, a organised criminal gang working shifts to private message or speak to her over a crackly line.\"There were red flags, but I kept denying them,\" she said. \"You think you have found the love of your life, and invest yourself 100% into the relationship.\"After about a month, Arnold told her stories such as suffering from an accident, his need for a working laptop, and business problems. He told her how worried he was by the coronavirus outbreak, an event that give him another chance to ask for money.She sent him funds via money transfer, and followed his request not to tell anyone because \"he would be embarrassed when he eventually met members of the family\".She ended up sending thousands of pounds. The money is now lost. It came from savings for a car or a holiday, and included some money that belonged to her daughter, who she first lied to rather than come clean about the loss.\"Eventually I knew I could not lie to my daughter anymore,\" she said. \"It is the emotions that you are left to deal with which is the hard part. I cannot trust anyone, and there is a lot of grief.\"In a fantasy world, I let myself think he is going to turn up and be real. You can be too emotionally involved in it.\"This \"addiction\" to hear someone saying nice things to you, and which blinds you to the reality, is common among victims, according to Lisa Mills, senior fraud manager at Victim Support in Sussex.During the current lockdown, when \"the feelings of loneliness can be overwhelming\", the risks were all the greater, she said.Sussex police run Operation Signature, a campaign to identify and support vulnerable victims of fraud.Romance scam cases were increasing, Mrs Mills said, even before lockdown - a picture reflected nationwide. Criminal gangs \"meet\" people on dating sites, then take the conversation onto private messaging, build up a picture of their victim, then take any opportunity to steal money from them.Source: Action FraudMrs Mills said that, in her experience, victims were split fairly evenly between men and women, with some losing so much money they were forced to remortgage their home.Most struggled to accept they had been scammed, even after the language used in messages was analysed to show they must have been written by different people in a gang, not just one individual.There is thought to be huge under-reporting of these scams, for the same reason.\"It has never been more important to reach out and know how to protect people,\" Mrs Mills said, urging anyone who may be concerned not to feel embarrassed but to seek help.</td>\n",

But under the UK's new policy, any tourists returning home after taking holidays in Spain and most other foreign destinations would have to spend two weeks in self-isolation.Several airlines including EasyJet, Jet2 and Ryanair have announced that they plan to resume flights and holidays soon.Easyjet will be resuming flights from 22 airports across Europe from 15 June, as well as regional flights across the UK. But there will only be one international flight from the UK - from Gatwick to Nice in France. Jet2 is planning to resume full services from 1 July, and will fly to several Spanish and Italian destinations, before opening up to Greece and Croatia later in the year.And Ryanair will be restoring 40% of its flights from 1 July and will resume flights from most of the 80 airports it flies from across Europe. Business groups wrote to Boris Johnson on Sunday saying the quarantine would have \"serious consequences\" for the economy and calling for \"air bridge\" deals to be struck with other nations.In their letter to the prime minister, bosses of airlines EasyJet, Tui, Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic, as well as industry bodies Airlines UK, the British Chambers of Commerce, UK Hospitality and manufacturing association Made UK said they had \"serious reservations\" about a \"blanket approach\" to all arrivals into Britain.Instead, they are asking for a more \"targeted, risk-based\" approach when establishing air links with countries that have high infection rates from the pandemic. \"The alternative risks major damage to the arteries of UK trade with key industry supply chains, whilst pushing the UK to the back of the queue as states begin conversations for opening up their borders,\" says the letter.  business\n",

The 195-year-old firm said it had to make \"some difficult decisions\" to re-energise the business, which has seen sales fall over the past year.The jobs will go over the next 18 months, said Clarks, adding that it was part of a wider plan to turn around the firm which will create 200 new jobs.The firm, which cut 170 jobs last year, employs 13,000 people globally.\"There are exciting opportunities ahead for our business, and we are having to make some difficult decisions to get there,\" said chief executive Giorgio Presca. \"We thank all affected staff for their contribution to our business and they leave their roles with our heartfelt respect and support.\"Clarks shut all of its stores in the UK and Ireland during the coronavirus lockdown, and said it will only reopen them \"when it is right and safe to do so\".It has already opened stores in countries including China as restrictions have been lifted, it added.The firm is consulting with its advisers on funding options for the future, it said, without giving further details.The company posted a £84.4m loss last year as sales dropped. It sold 20 million pairs of shoes in the year to February 2019, two million fewer than the year before, citing \"extremely tough\" conditions on the high street.It also said it will close some of its worst-performing stores.Last year it closed its only remaining UK factory after it failed to hit its targets for making desert boots. The factory opened in 2017.The company started making shoes in the UK in 1825 but production was moved to the Far East in 2005.Prior to that, the last remaining Clarks plant in the UK - Millom in Cumbria - closed in 2006.  business\n",

Even those with robust online offerings have reported huge drops in sales.Next, for instance, saw online sales decline by 32% in the three months to the end of April. Like others, it is keen to re-open stores, as soon as it is deemed safe to do so.Next said: \"We have plans in place for the re-purposing of our stores ready to reopen in a socially-distanced world.\"Its measures include installing screens at tills, placing sanitisation stations in stores and managing the number of customers that are allowed to enter its shops.M&S has kept its food stores open during the crisis, including almost 300 shops that sell fashion as well, although these areas have been blocked off.But it says they're ready to be reopened as soon as the government gives it the green light.\"Our 290 stores that sell both clothing and food are led by a single manager - so it means they already have a brilliant working knowledge of the necessary hygiene measures, how to manage social distancing and the flow of our customers in and out of their store,\" M&S said.Last week the government said its strategy was to \"open non-essential retail when and where it is safe to do so\", and subject to those retailers being able to follow new guidelines.It said the intention was for this to happen in phases from 1 June, although it added that it would issue further guidance on which businesses will be allowed to open and when.That guidance can't come soon enough, according to Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC).\"Retailers desperately need clarity in the rules regarding when and how they can open - details that are still lacking,\" she said.She warned that safety must be the primary concern in the decisions, rather than size or type of shop. The retail experience is going to be turned on its head when clothes stores reopen,\" predicted Mr Lin from Retail Economics.\"Retailers are having to reinterpret government guidelines and have to invest heavily to make sure they can create a safe environment.\"He said consumers will remain incredibly anxious and cautious about returning to fashion retailers.Changing rooms are expected to remain closed while customers will be encouraged to avoid touching merchandise.\"Staff will potentially have to walk around spraying shelves,\" Mr Lin said.There are likely to be one-way systems through stores with clear floor markings and signage, while customer entry will be limited and consumers will be encouraged to shop alone.Next said it will \"prioritise the opening of our larger out-of-town stores first\".Their bigger size makes them easier to adapt and they have large car parks and outside spaces to manage queues, it said.\"Retailers have started to plan how they can open stores and follow safety guidelines, with some hinting at sales when they do open their doors, such as Next,\" said Dan Plant, savings expert at UKHotDeals.\"Other popular stores, like Primark, lack online sales space, so we'd expect to see plenty of fashion offers when retailers reopen.\"But while fashion stores may reopen with deep discounts to clear old stock, most online retailers have already been offering sales to encourage shoppers.M&S, for instance, launched its \"rainbow sale\" on Friday with up to 50% off and 10% of takings going to NHS charities.Boohoo, Fat Face, French Connection, Gap, JD Sports , Next, Superdry and Topshop have offered similar 50%-off deals.The likes of Asos, Clarks, Dune, Debenhams, John Lewis, Karen Millen, New Look, Office and Quiz have also been offering cut-price deals.   business\n",
       "1733  MPs are to grill health officials on whether they overpaid for personal protective equipment to deal with coronavirus.The MP leading the inquiry says the crisis should not be an excuse for failing to achieve value for money.One focus of their interest could be a little-known pest control company which won a contract to supply PPE worth more than £100m.The government says it wants firms that can quickly provide a lot of PPE.PestFix, part of a company called Crisp Websites, signed the £109m contract with the government on 13 April to supply what were specified as \"urgently needed gloves, gowns and masks to the NHS supply chain.\"The business operates from a unit by Littlehampton Marina on the West Sussex coast. Its accounts show that last year it had net assets of just £18,000.Yet officials sealed the deal with PestFix without putting the order out to other suppliers in a competitive tendering process, saying in the contract that because it was a matter of \"extreme urgency\" they were able to place the order \"without competing or advertising the requirement\".PestFix says it has delivered more than 67 million items of PPE into the NHS Supply Chain.\"Our small, dedicated global team, spanning three continents, has worked non-stop for the past 70 days to support efforts of getting PPE to the front line involving an ongoing and herculean logistics operation,\" its director, Dan England, told BBC News.But the contract has added to concerns that in the scramble to get hold of vital equipment as the coronavirus situation deteriorated, the government may have paid too much.Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, would not comment on particular cases before taking evidence on Monday.But she said: \"Just getting numbers on its own isn't enough. You need to get value for money for the taxpayer, even in difficult times.\"A hundred public sector contracts worth £342m had been signed for Covid-related PPE by the end of last month, according to the specialist data firm, Tussell.So nearly a third by value was accounted for by the single order to PestFix.One of the UK's most senior civil servants, the permanent secretary of the Cabinet Office, Alex Chisholm, told the committee last week that is was difficult to make value for money assessments in the current situation.\"You'll find for PPE, ventilators and lots of other things we've purchased, that the per unit cost of buying things at great speed from multiple sources in a sellers' market has been higher than we would like to have paid,\" Mr Chisholm said.\"So if you compared the average cost a year ago to what we've been paying now, it's been expensive\".But he said the spending was necessary and there was no alternative.The procurement process has been fraught with problems.A shipment in early May of more than 80 tonnes of protective gowns from Turkey was first delayed and then rejected by inspectors as faulty.Meg Hillier is incensed by the Turkish episode, saying \"We should not be paying money for old rope.\"But small businesses say they have been doing their best to help in the country's hour of need.The next biggest contract for PPE, after PestFix, was granted to a marine supplies company near Salisbury, Ocean Footprint, which had been buying protective masks from China to sell to boatyards.Ocean Footprint agreed to supply the NHS with three million high grade masks for £5m. In the next few days it will have delivered more than a million of them.\"I'm open about what we've done,\" says the managing director Peter Harrison, adding that it is easy to forget how anxious a time it was for health officials and suppliers as the deals were being struck.\"It was desperate. It was all hands on deck. We hadn't even reached the peak.\"The company knew that getting hold of enough masks in rivalry with other countries would be impossible, so it invested £100,000 in its own mask-making machine in order to be able to complete the order.The NHS could have bought similar masks much more cheaply before the crisis, Mr Harrison admits, but he says frantic worldwide demand, rising raw material costs and the need for air transport have sent prices spiralling upwards.He says that at the price he is selling to the government he could offload his entire stock to other buyers in a day.A not-for-profit campaign group, The Good Law Project, has announced that it will seek a judicial review of the decision to award PestFix with its PPE contract.The review would be to find out why there was no competition for the order and how the company was chosen.Dan England from PestFix says: \"We continue to work in close partnership with the NHS, MOD Procurement and DHSC Covid-19 procurement teams, who have all demonstrated incredible dedication in supporting PestFix to deliver this highly complex transaction.\"A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"During this unprecedented global pandemic, we have been working around the clock to ensure PPE is delivered as quickly as possible to those on the frontline and we have delivered more than 1.7 billion items since the outbreak began.\"We are prioritising companies that can provide large volumes of PPE at a fast pace, while ensuring all new PPE undergoes vigorous checks to ensure they meet the safety and quality required. We are grateful for all offers - some will be rejected based on these standards.\"  business\n",

The 62-year-old, who is a widow, met \"Arnold\" after using a dating site for the very first time.She said they spoke morning, noon and night for five months about a shared love of music and family.But the man she thought was an American living overseas was, in fact, a organised criminal gang working shifts to private message or speak to her over a crackly line.\"There were red flags, but I kept denying them,\" she said. \"You think you have found the love of your life, and invest yourself 100% into the relationship.\"After about a month, Arnold told her stories such as suffering from an accident, his need for a working laptop, and business problems. He told her how worried he was by the coronavirus outbreak, an event that give him another chance to ask for money.She sent him funds via money transfer, and followed his request not to tell anyone because \"he would be embarrassed when he eventually met members of the family\".She ended up sending thousands of pounds. The money is now lost. It came from savings for a car or a holiday, and included some money that belonged to her daughter, who she first lied to rather than come clean about the loss.\"Eventually I knew I could not lie to my daughter anymore,\" she said. \"It is the emotions that you are left to deal with which is the hard part. I cannot trust anyone, and there is a lot of grief.\"In a fantasy world, I let myself think he is going to turn up and be real. You can be too emotionally involved in it.\"This \"addiction\" to hear someone saying nice things to you, and which blinds you to the reality, is common among victims, according to Lisa Mills, senior fraud manager at Victim Support in Sussex.During the current lockdown, when \"the feelings of loneliness can be overwhelming\", the risks were all the greater, she said.Sussex police run Operation Signature, a campaign to identify and support vulnerable victims of fraud.Romance scam cases were increasing, Mrs Mills said, even before lockdown - a picture reflected nationwide. Criminal gangs \"meet\" people on dating sites, then take the conversation onto private messaging, build up a picture of their victim, then take any opportunity to steal money from them.Source: Action FraudMrs Mills said that, in her experience, victims were split fairly evenly between men and women, with some losing so much money they were forced to remortgage their home.Most struggled to accept they had been scammed, even after the language used in messages was analysed to show they must have been written by different people in a gang, not just one individual.There is thought to be huge under-reporting of these scams, for the same reason.\"It has never been more important to reach out and know how to protect people,\" Mrs Mills said, urging anyone who may be concerned not to feel embarrassed but to seek help.  business"

reminding us in the future of what life and our relationship with nature could be when global public mobility and many pollution-generating activities are reduced,\" explained Phil Manning from the University of Manchester The team acknowledges that \"significant sacrifices\" will have to be made by everyone in order to reduce our impact on the planet's climate system, and to move towards the sustainable use of the Earth's natural resources  It is hoped that the positive experiences many people had with nature during lockdown, and the recollection of those experiences, will help build the case for behaviour changes to help shift us towards sustainability During the lockdown, wildlife reclaiming the streets of towns and cities during lockdown have made headlines around the world  For example, goats that normally keep themselves to themselves in the hills surrounding Llandudno, Wales, ventured into the town's deserted streets People have also reported that they have been able to hear birdsong more clearly without the constant hum of traffic The submissions will be collated by the Earth Project team, which consists of concerned citizens alongside scientists from multiple UK universities, including Bangor, Belfast, Durham, Manchester and Plymouth Prof Manning told BBC News that the recordings of birdsong, night skies and nature calls will be made available online for everyone to enjoy and to relive the better moments of life under lockdown \"The survey results will help provide an overview of people's observations and thoughts on the environment before, during and after lockdown,\" he observed \"The responses will be analysed and summarised and then made available along with the database on our website during the late Summer and Autumn of 2020 \"He said that it was hoped that the findings of the survey could encourage behaviour change and help shape policies and strategies that could deliver greener and sustainable lifestyles \"The Earth Project… has the potential to provide a snapshot of what happened to the environment and wildlife when human activity is drastically reduced or simply managed in a more sustainable way,\" Prof Manning said As part of

from climate change in coming decades, according to a new analysis By 2050, it's estimated that almost one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year  But tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says  The study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously While the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot Extreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years  A typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there  Smoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year  These and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new study compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt As football slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050 In the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat Cricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies Venues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade  In golf, one in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says  Winter sports also face an uncertain future  Researchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050 But as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions  The author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country like Bolivia at the low end but as large as a country like Spain on the high end The estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate Whatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author  \"Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,\" said David Goldblatt \"Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,\" he said While some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050, the majority of sports authorities have not  The International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up  Among winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, \"which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,\" the report waspishly notes  The report was commissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance, a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change  \"A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,\" said Andrew Simms from

[Global sport faces major disruption from climate change in coming decades, according to a new analysis, By 2050, it's estimated that almost one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year,  But tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says,  The study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously, While the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot, Extreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years,  A typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there,  Smoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year,  These and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new study compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt, As football slowly recovers from the coronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050, In the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat, Cricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies, Venues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade,  In golf, one in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says,  Winter sports also face an uncertain future,  Researchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050, But as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at the contribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions,  The author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country like Bolivia at the low end but as large as a country like Spain on the high end, The estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate, Whatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author,  \"Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,\" said David Goldblatt, \"Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,\" he said, While some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050, the majority of sports authorities have not,  The International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up,  Among winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, \"which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,\" the report waspishly notes,  The report was commissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance, a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change,  \"A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,\" said Andrew Simms from the group, \"If players also speak out and say they believe clean air and a stable climate matter, millions more will see the possibilities for change,   It will not only send a message of hope for the wider world, but it will help to guarantee a planet that is safe for sport, \"Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc, ]\n",

       "      <td>A clear picture is emerging of why the asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago was so catastrophic The space object, which wiped out 75% of all species including the dinosaurs, hit the worst possible place on the planet and - according to new research - at the most lethal angle Investigations at the crater site, together mputer simulations, suggest the impactor dug into the crust at an inclination of up to 60 degrees This exacerbated the climatic fallout We know that the target rocks, in what is now the Gulf of Mexico, contained huge volumes of sulphur from the mineral gypsum  When this material was thrown high into the atmosphere and mixed with water vapour, it produced a \"global winter\" And the angle of attack ensured this environmental crisis was intense and prolonged    \"At 45 to 60 degrees, the impact is very efficient at vaporising and ejecting debris to high altitude  If the impact happens at shallower or much steeper angles, the amount of material that's put into the atmosphere that can then have climate-changing effects is significantly less,\" explained Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London  \"It's evident that the nature of the location where this event happened, together with the impact angle, made for a perfect storm,\" he told BBC News The majority of plant and animal life on Earth succumbed to the the nditions Prof Collins' lleagues' work is published in the journal Nature Communications Prof Collins is part of an international team that's been studying the anatomy of the crater associated with the calamitous asteroid strike  Today, this 200km-wide structure is positioned under Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, with its best preserved central portions sitting just offshore of the port of Chicxulub It's hard to grasp the scale of the forces that produced it The impactor, thought to be about 12km in diameter, punched an instantaneous hole in the crust that was probably some 30km deep  As fluidised rocks at the base of this bowl rebounded, they created in just a few minutes a mountain that was higher than Everest  This didn't last, however, and it fell back, to leave a prominent inner ring of hills, or peaks What's interesting from Prof Collins' perspective is the asymmetry that was frozen into the Chicxulub structure For example, if you look at the centres of the crater, of its peak ring and of the uplifted rock that underlies the crust in Earth's mantle - these points do not map directly on top of each other  They're actually aligned in a northeast-southwest direction, with the crater centre in between the centres of mantle uplift and peak-ring formation This is a vital clue in determining not only the direction from which the asteroid arrived but the angle at which it hit the planet The Imperial researcher ran a number of simulations on the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) DiRAC High Performance Computing Facility  The only way he can reproduce the geometry is by having the me in from the northeast and strike the Earth at an angle of roughly 60 degrees Prof Collins said: \"If you run the model at different impact angles, at 30 degrees and at 45 degrees, say, you can't match the observations - you get centres of mantle uplift and of the peak ring on the downrange side of the crater centre  And for a straight overhead impact, at 90 degrees, the centres are all on top of each other  So, that's doesn't match the observations, either \"lleague -author Prof Joanna Morgan added: \"Knowing the direction of impact means we now know which part of the target site was subjected to the greatest shock pressures  \"The sulphur-bearing and carbon-bearing sedimentary rocks actually thicken as you go from east to west, and to the south  So this result means we're degassing more of those sediments than we would if you just took an average value for their thickness \"And Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US, told BBC News: \"This new modelling provides a clear answer to the angle of the impact and the direction of the impact that largely settles a long-standing debate on what was downrange of the impact   \"Also critical is that a 60-degree angle is in the range of the worst options for injecting large volumes of vaporised and ejected sulphur-rich rocks into the atmosphere   \"Thus these results are critical for understanding potential 'kill mechanisms',\" -author explained Gulick and Morgan led the expedition that drilled into the Chicxulub Crater in 2016 to recover some of its rocks for an analysis The impact that changed life on</td>\n",

       "      <td>Global sport faces major disruption from climate change ming decades, according to a new analysis By 2050, it's estimated that almost one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year  But tennis, rugby, athletics and winter sports will also face serious challenges from the impacts of rising temperatures, the author says  The study finds that sports leaders are, in the main, failing to address the issue seriously While the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life, many experts believe that this is just a dress rehearsal for the long-term impacts on sport of a world that's way too hot Extreme weather events, related to rising temperatures, have already disrupted some of the world's most high-profile sports in recent years  A typhoon, which wreaked havoc in Japan last year, also affected fixtures at the Rugby Union World being held there  Smoke from bush fires stopped play at the Australian Tennis Open at the start of this year  These and many other instances are a foretaste of the future, according to this new mpiled by academic and author David Goldblatt As football slowly recovers from ronavirus crisis, his analysis shows that 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050 In the current Premier League, the home grounds of Southampton, Norwich, Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat Cricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places like India, Australia and the West Indies Venues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60% increase in days with temperatures over 40C over the next decade  In golf, one in three British urses will be damaged by rising sea-levels, the report says  Winter sports also face an uncertain future  Researchers say that of the 19 venues that have already hosted the Winter Olympics, just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050 But as well as showing the likely impacts of climate change on sports, the new study also looks at ntribution that the sporting industry makes to carbon emissions  The author says that the scale of CO2 is equivalent to untry like Bolivia at the low end but as large as untry like Spain on the high end The estimations are likely an underestimate as they exclude the global sportswear and sports broadcasting industries, who have impacts on carbon that are difficult to calculate Whatever the size of its carbon footprint, the cultural significance of sport gives it a tremendous platform to effect change, says the author  \"Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single megacity, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total,\" said David Goldblatt \"Making a carbon zero world mmon sense priority of the sports world would make a ntribution to making it mmon sense priority of all politics,\" he said While some organisations including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050, the majority of sports authorities have not  The International Cricket Council is one of those who have not signed up  Among winter sports, only the ice hockey and skiing federations have joined, \"which makes one wonder what the people in charge of luge and bobsleigh think they are going to be sliding on in the future,\" the report waspishly notes  The report mmissioned by the Rapid Transition Alliance, a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to climate change  \"A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil mpanies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles,\" said Andrew Simms from the group \"If players also speak out and say they believe clean air and a stable climate matter, millions more will see the possibilities for change   It will not only send a message of hope for the wider world, but it will help to guarantee a planet that is safe for sport</td>\n",

       "291  A clear picture is emerging of why the asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago was so catastrophic The space object, which wiped out 75% of all species including the dinosaurs, hit the worst possible place on the planet and - according to new research - at the most lethal angle Investigations at the crater site, together mputer simulations, suggest the impactor dug into the crust at an inclination of up to 60 degrees This exacerbated the climatic fallout We know that the target rocks, in what is now the Gulf of Mexico, contained huge volumes of sulphur from the mineral gypsum  When this material was thrown high into the atmosphere and mixed with water vapour, it produced a \"global winter\" And the angle of attack ensured this environmental crisis was intense and prolonged    \"At 45 to 60 degrees, the impact is very efficient at vaporising and ejecting debris to high altitude  If the impact happens at shallower or much steeper angles, the amount of material that's put into the atmosphere that can then have climate-changing effects is significantly less,\" explained Prof Gareth Collins from Imperial College London  \"It's evident that the nature of the location where this event happened, together with the impact angle, made for a perfect storm,\" he told BBC News The majority of plant and animal life on Earth succumbed to the the nditions Prof Collins' lleagues' work is published in the journal Nature Communications Prof Collins is part of an international team that's been studying the anatomy of the crater associated with the calamitous asteroid strike  Today, this 200km-wide structure is positioned under Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, with its best preserved central portions sitting just offshore of the port of Chicxulub It's hard to grasp the scale of the forces that produced it The impactor, thought to be about 12km in diameter, punched an instantaneous hole in the crust that was probably some 30km deep  As fluidised rocks at the base of this bowl rebounded, they created in just a few minutes a mountain that was higher than Everest  This didn't last, however, and it fell back, to leave a prominent inner ring of hills, or peaks What's interesting from Prof Collins' perspective is the asymmetry that was frozen into the Chicxulub structure For example, if you look at the centres of the crater, of its peak ring and of the uplifted rock that underlies the crust in Earth's mantle - these points do not map directly on top of each other  They're actually aligned in a northeast-southwest direction, with the crater centre in between the centres of mantle uplift and peak-ring formation This is a vital clue in determining not only the direction from which the asteroid arrived but the angle at which it hit the planet The Imperial researcher ran a number of simulations on the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) DiRAC High Performance Computing Facility  The only way he can reproduce the geometry is by having the me in from the northeast and strike the Earth at an angle of roughly 60 degrees Prof Collins said: \"If you run the model at different impact angles, at 30 degrees and at 45 degrees, say, you can't match the observations - you get centres of mantle uplift and of the peak ring on the downrange side of the crater centre  And for a straight overhead impact, at 90 degrees, the centres are all on top of each other  So, that's doesn't match the observations, either \"lleague -author Prof Joanna Morgan added: \"Knowing the direction of impact means we now know which part of the target site was subjected to the greatest shock pressures  \"The sulphur-bearing and carbon-bearing sedimentary rocks actually thicken as you go from east to west, and to the south  So this result means we're degassing more of those sediments than we would if you just took an average value for their thickness \"And Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US, told BBC News: \"This new modelling provides a clear answer to the angle of the impact and the direction of the impact that largely settles a long-standing debate on what was downrange of the impact   \"Also critical is that a 60-degree angle is in the range of the worst options for injecting large volumes of vaporised and ejected sulphur-rich rocks into the atmosphere   \"Thus these results are critical for understanding potential 'kill mechanisms',\" -author explained Gulick and Morgan led the expedition that drilled into the Chicxulub Crater in 2016 to recover some of its rocks for an analysis The impact that changed life on   science\n",
